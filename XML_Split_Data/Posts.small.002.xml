&lt;p&gt;Properties have other advantages over fields. They're a more explicit contract, they're  serialized, they can be debugged later, they're a nice place for extension through inheritance. The clunkier syntax is an accidental complexity -- .net 3.5 for example overcomes this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common (and flawed) practice is to start with public fields, and turn them into properties later, on an 'as needed' basis.

&lt;p&gt;I do see value in learing the Win32 API. Most, if not all, GUI libraries (managed or unmanaged) result in calls to the Win32 API. Even the most thorough libraries don't cover 100% of the API, and hence there are always gaps which need to be plugged by direct API calls or P/invoking. Some of the names of the wrappers around the API calls have similar names to the underlying API calls, but those names aren't exactly self-documenting. So understanding the underlying API, and the terminology used therein, will aid in understanding the wrapper APIs and what they actually do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, if you understand the nature of the underlying APIs that are used by frameworks, then you will make better choices with regards to which library functionality you should use in a given scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

I just think that if you just make the "full" format, applications consuming this information are more likely to support/handle it.  Though the rel="me" stuff is extra information that you don't get from other things.  I'd say use those since they're easy, and adds information that no other format/standard really does (that I know of).&lt;/p&gt;" OwnerUserId="660" LastActivityDate="2008-08-08T01:13:56.353" CommentCount="1"/>

&lt;P&gt;OP asked about an ecommerce solution, as far as I recall WordPress and Drupal aren't shopping cart apps. Perhaps that's the reason your reply was modded down.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;@nuggs -&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;1/ If you're building this app as a commercial concern, i.e. it pays the rent then be realistic and choose a shopping cart app that best suits the requirements. Don't go spending time rolling your own, find a good one and integrate it. Don't get hung up on open source and the hope that one day you might contribute back, be realistic.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;2/ Don't roll your own, get one off the shelf, your time is money. For a couple of hundred pounds you can pick up a commercial product like Cactushop. If you go down the F/OSS route then make sure the project has a decent predigree and ongoing development. Don't think that because the cart app is F/OSS you'll be able to maintain it should the project go tits up, the codebase could be a complete nightmare or utilise techniques and technology beyond your skills and capabilities. Trust me, I've been there with an open source Perl app that looked like line noise.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;3/ PayPal and Google are great for getting started because they provide a foot in the door to being able to accept online payments with very little entry cost. However at higher transaction volumes they aren't the best value for money. As your volume of transactions increase you may want to look at a dedicated payment processor such as HSBC, ProtX, SecPay etc. You'll get better support (i.e. people who answer phones) and better tech support when things go wrong. In addition to whoever you choose as a payment processor, make sure you have a fall back prepared. It's not unknown for any of the well know processors to have bad hair days. Be prepared for these scenarios. Your secondary processor may cost more per transaction but at least you can still take payments.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;And finally, be fair to your customer, estimate the app properly. If he's not happy to pay for your time, software or services that will help you bring the app in on time then walk away. Don't make a rod for your own back by giving your time and effort away free.&lt;/P&gt;" OwnerUserId="419" LastEditorUserId="419" LastEditorDisplayName="Kevin Kenny" LastEditDate="2008-08-08T01:37:59.550" LastActivityDate="2008-08-08T01:37:59.550" CommentCount="1"/>

&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering what the performance implications are for this approach.

If you are primarily inserting 1000 rows a second and not doing any querying, then a clustered index is a hit to performance.  If you are doing 1000 queries a second, then not having an index will lead to very bad performance.  The best thing to do when trying to tune queries/indexes is to use the Query Plan Analyzer and SQL Profiler in SQL Server.  This will show you where you are running into costly table scans or other performance blockers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the GUID vs ID argument, you can find people online that swear by both.  I have always been taught to use GUIDs unless I have a really good reason not to.  Jeff has a good post that talks about the reasons for using GUIDs: &lt;a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000817.html"&gt;http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000817.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with most anything development related, if you are looking to improve performance there is not one, single right answer.  It really depends on what you are trying to accomplish and how you are implementing the solution.  The only true answer is to test, test, and test again against performance metrics to ensure that you are meeting your goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Edit]
@Matt, after doing some more research on the GUID/ID debate I came across this post.  Like I mentioned before, there is not a true right or wrong answer.  It depends on your specific implementation needs.  But these are some pretty valid reasons to use GUIDs as the primary key:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For example, there is an issue known as a "hotspot", where certain pages of data in a table are under relatively high currency contention. Basically, what happens is most of the traffic on a table (and hence page-level locks) occurs on a small area of the table, towards the end. New records will always go to this hotspot, because IDENTITY is a sequential number generator. These inserts are troublesome because they require Exlusive page lock on the page they are added to (the hotspot). This effectively serializes all inserts to a table thanks to the page locking mechanism. NewID() on the other hand does not suffer from hotspots. Values generated using the NewID() function are only sequential for short bursts of inserts (where the function is being called very quickly, such as during a multi-row insert), which causes the inserted rows to spread randomly throughout the table's data pages instead of all at the end - thus eliminating a hotspot from inserts.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Also, because the inserts are randomly distributed, the chance of page splits is greatly reduced. While a page split here and there isnt too bad, the effects do add up quickly. With IDENTITY, page Fill Factor is pretty useless as a tuning mechanism and might as well be set to 100% - rows will never be inserted in any page but the last one. With NewID(), you can actually make use of Fill Factor as a performance-enabling tool. You can set Fill Factor to a level that approximates estimated volume growth between index rebuilds, and then schedule the rebuilds during off-peak hours using dbcc reindex. This effectively delays the performance hits of page splits until off-peak times.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;If you even &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; you might need to enable replication for the table in question - then you might as well make the PK a uniqueidentifier and flag the guid field as ROWGUIDCOL. Replication will require a uniquely valued guid field with this attribute, and it will add one if none exists. If a suitable field exists, then it will just use the one thats there.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Yet another huge benefit for using GUIDs for PKs is the fact that the value is indeed guaranteed unique - not just among all values generated by &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; server, but all values generated by &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; computers - whether it be your db server, web server, app server, or client machine. Pretty much every modern language has the capability of generating a valid guid now - in .NET you can use System.Guid.NewGuid. This is VERY handy when dealing with cached master-detail datasets in particular. You dont have to employ crazy temporary keying schemes just to relate your records together before they are committed. You just fetch a perfectly valid new Guid from the operating system for each new record's permanent key value at the time the record is created. &lt;/p&gt;

I used this to do a little test:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$i=0;
    while($i&amp;lt;10000)
     {
      $rand = rand(0,100);
     if(!isset($array[$rand]))
      {
      $array[$rand] = 1;
      }
     else 
      {
      $array[$rand]++;
      }
     sort($array);
     $i++;
     }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the results to be evenly distributed, and there is an odd pattern to the number of times each number is generated.&lt;/p&gt;

The program in question tries to post form data via an AJAX call to a target procedure contained in the same package as the caller. This is done for a site that uses a secure connection (&lt;strong&gt;https&lt;/strong&gt;). The technology used here is &lt;a href="http://www.orafaq.com/wiki/PL/SQL_FAQ" rel="nofollow"&gt;PLSQL&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;DOJO&lt;/a&gt; JavaScript library. The development tool is &lt;a href="http://www.allroundautomations.nl/plsqldev.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;basically a text editor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code Snippet:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;function testPost() {  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;dojo.xhrPost( {&lt;br /&gt;
                 url: ''dr_tm_w_0120.test_post'',&lt;br /&gt;

                 load: testPostXHRCallback,&lt;br /&gt;
                 error: testPostXHRError&lt;br /&gt;
                });&lt;br /&gt;
          }  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;function testPostXHRCallback(data,ioArgs) {  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;     alert(''post callback'');  
      try{  
      dojo.byId("messageDiv").innerHTML = data;  
      }  
      catch(ex){  
            if(ex.name == "TypeError")  
            {  
              alert("A type error occurred.");  
            }  
      }   
      return data;  
   }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;function testPostXHRError(data, ioArgs) {    &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;     alert(data);  
      alert(''Error when retrieving data from the server!'');  
      return data;  
   }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Problem:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When using IE6 (which the entire user-base uses), the response sent back from the server is a 404 error. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The program works fine in Firefox.&lt;br /&gt;
The calling procedure cannot target any procedures within the same package.&lt;br /&gt;
The calling procedure can target outside sites (both http, https).&lt;br /&gt;
The other AJAX calls in the package that are not posts of form data work fine.&lt;br /&gt;
I've searched the &lt;em&gt;internets&lt;/em&gt; and consulted with senior-skilled team members and haven't discovered anything that satisfactorily addresses the issue.&lt;br /&gt;
*Tried &lt;a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/forum/dojo-core-dojo-0-9/dojo-core-support/xhrpost-firefox-fine-ie-not-so-much" rel="nofollow"&gt;Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/a&gt; over at Dojo support forums.      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What troubleshooting techniques do you recommend?&lt;br /&gt;
What troubleshooting tools do you recommend for HTTPS analyzing?&lt;br /&gt;
Any hypotheses on what the issue might be?&lt;br /&gt;
Any ideas for workarounds that aren't total (bad) hacks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ed. The Solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
lomaxx, thx for the &lt;a href="http://www.orafaq.com/wiki/PL/SQL_FAQ" rel="nofollow"&gt;fiddler&lt;/a&gt; tip. you have no idea how awesome it was to get that and use it as a debugging tool. after starting it up this is what i found and how i fixed it (at least in the short term):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;ef Fri, 8 Aug 2008 14:01:26 GMT dr_tm_w_0120.test_post: SIGNATURE (parameter names) MISMATCH VARIABLES IN FORM NOT IN PROCEDURE: SO1_DISPLAYED_,PO1_DISPLAYED_,RWA2_DISPLAYED_,DD1_DISPLAYED_ NON-DEFAULT VARIABLES IN PROCEDURE NOT IN FORM: 0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After seeing that message from the server, I kicked around Fiddler a bit more to see what else I could learn from it. Found that there's a WebForms tab that shows the values in the web form. Wouldn't you know it, the "xxx_DISPLAYED_" fields above were in it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't really understand yet why these fields exist, because I didn't create them explicitly in the web PLSQL code. But I do understand now that the target procedure has to include them as parameters to work correctly. Again, this is only in the case of IE6 for me, as Firefox worked fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that the short term answer and hack to fix it. Hopefully, a little more work in this area will lead to a better understanding of the fundamentals going on here. &lt;/p&gt;

You do get a different answer on the first call to your wrapper (provided you're using YEAR TO FRACTION(5) or some other type with high enough resolution to show the the difference) but then you get that same value back on every single subsequent call, which ensures that any sort of loop will never terminate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Assert.IsNotNull(zoo.Animals);&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And  then verify that the enumerator actually  enumerates over all the things you added to the Zoo. Which is what I was going for there. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if it's even possible to test if yield return is being called, because yield return is just syntactic sugar for a compiler-generated IEnumerable. For instance, calling &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;zoo.Animals.GetEnumerator();&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;will not execute any of the code you wrote in the enumerator. The first time that happens is on the first call to IEnumerator.MoveNext();&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you're trying to test the interaction between the concrete Zoo and the IEnumerable contained by that Zoo, you should make the IEnumerable a field on Zoo and inject a mock IEnumerable to that field instead of implementing a concrete IEnumerable directly in Zoo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using Passive View your View typically implement a fain grained interface with properties mapping more or less directly to the underlaying UI widget. For instance you might have a ICustomerView with properties like Name and Address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your implementation might look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class CustomerView : ICustomerView
{
    public string Name
    { 
        get { return txtName.Text; }
        set { txtName.Text = value; }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your Presenter class will talk to the model and "map" it to the view. This approach is called the "Passive View". The benefit is that the view is easy to test, and it is easier to move between UI platforms (Web/Win/XAML etc). The disadvantage is that you cant leverage things like databinding (which is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; powerfull in frameworks like WPF and Silverlight).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second flavor of MVP is the Supervising Controller. In that case your View might have a property called Customer, which then again is databound to the UI widgets. You don't have to think about synchronizing and micro-manage the view, and the Supervising Controller can step in and help when needed, for instance with compled interaction logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third "flavor" of MVP (or someone would perhaps call it a separate pattern) is the Presentation Model (or sometimes referred to Model-View-ViewModel). Compared to the MVP you "merge" the M and the P into one class. You have your customer object which your UI widgets is data bound to, but you also have additional UI-spesific fields like "IsButtonEnabled", or "IsReadOnly" etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the best resource I've found to UI architecture is the series of blog posts done by Jeremy Miller over at &lt;a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2007/07/25/the-build-your-own-cab-series-table-of-contents.aspx"&gt;The Build Your Own CAB Series Table of Contents&lt;/a&gt;. He covered all the flavors of MVP, and show C# code to implement them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also blogged about the Model-View-ViewModel pattern in the context of Silverlight over at &lt;a href="http://jonas.follesoe.no/2008/07/19/youcard-re-visited-implementing-the-viewmodel-pattern"&gt;YouCard Re-visited: Implementing the ViewModel pattern&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of a placeholder for a value - variables - maps onto something we're taught in school - algebra.  There isn't an existing parallel you can draw without understanding how memory is physically laid out within a computer, and no one thinks about this kind of thing until they're dealing with low level things - at the C/C++/byte communications level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Are there any tools or thought processes that helped you understand how pointers work at the variable, function, and beyond level?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addresses boxes.  I remember when I was learning to program BASIC into microcomputers, there were these pretty books with games in them, and sometimes you had to poke values into particular addresses.  They had a picture of a bunch of boxes, incrementally labelled with 0, 1, 2... and it was explained that only one small thing (a byte) could fit in these boxes, and there were a lot of them - some computers had as many as 65535!  They were next to each other, and they all had an address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What are some good practice things that can be done to bring somebody to the level of, "Ah-hah, I got it," without getting them bogged down in the overall concept? Basically, drill like scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a drill?  Make a struct:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-cpp prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;struct {
char a;
char b;
char c;
char d;
} mystruct;
mystruct.a = 'r';
mystruct.b = 's';
mystruct.c = 't';
mystruct.d = 'u';

char* my_pointer;
my_pointer = &amp;amp;mystruct.b;
cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 'Start: my_pointer = ' &amp;lt;&amp;lt; *my_pointer &amp;lt;&amp;lt; endl;
my_pointer++;
cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 'After: my_pointer = ' &amp;lt;&amp;lt; *my_pointer &amp;lt;&amp;lt; endl;
my_pointer = &amp;amp;mystruct.a;
cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 'Then: my_pointer = ' &amp;lt;&amp;lt; *my_pointer &amp;lt;&amp;lt; endl;
my_pointer = my_pointer + 3;
cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 'End: my_pointer = ' &amp;lt;&amp;lt; *my_pointer &amp;lt;&amp;lt; endl;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same example as above, except in C:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Same example as above, except in C:
struct {
    char a;
    char b;
    char c;
    char d;
} mystruct;

mystruct.a = 'r';
mystruct.b = 's';
mystruct.c = 't';
mystruct.d = 'u';

char* my_pointer;
my_pointer = &amp;amp;mystruct.b;

printf("Start: my_pointer = %c\n", *my_pointer);
my_pointer++;
printf("After: my_pointer = %c\n", *my_pointer);
my_pointer = &amp;amp;mystruct.a;
printf("Then: my_pointer = %c\n", *my_pointer);
my_pointer = my_pointer + 3;
printf("End: my_pointer = %c\n", *my_pointer);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Start: my_pointer = s
After: my_pointer = t
Then: my_pointer = r
End: my_pointer = u
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that explains some of the basics through example?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've found that the best analogy is to consider the pointer as a piece of paper with a house address on it, and the memory block it references as the actual house. All sorts of operations can thus be easily explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've added some Delphi code down below, and some comments where appropriate. I chose Delphi since my other main programming language, C#, does not exhibit things like memory leaks in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you only wish to learn the high-level concept of pointers, then you should ignore the parts labelled "Memory layout" in the explanation below. They are intended to give examples of what memory could look like after operations, but they are more low-level in nature. However, in order to accurately explain how buffer overruns really work, it was important that I added these diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: For all intents and purposes, this explanation and the example memory
layouts are vastly simplified. There's more overhead and a lot more details you would
need to know if you need to deal with memory on a low-level basis. However, for the
intents of explaining memory and pointers, it is accurate enough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's assume the THouse class used below looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;type
    THouse = class
    private
        FName : array[0..9] of Char;
    public
        constructor Create(name: PChar);
    end;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you initialize the house object, the name given to the constructor is copied into the private field FName. There is a reason it is defined as a fixed-size array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In memory, there will be some overhead associated with the house allocation, I'll illustrate this below like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]---
     ^   ^
     |   |
     |   +- the FName array
     |
     +- overhead
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "tttt" area is overhead, there will typically be more of this for various types of runtimes and languages, like 8 or 12 bytes. It is imperative that whatever values are stored in this area never gets changed by anything other than the memory allocator or the core system routines, or you risk crashing the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allocate memory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get an entrepreneur to build your house, and give you the address to the house. In contrast to the real world, memory allocation cannot be told where to allocate, but will find a suitable spot with enough room, and report back the address to the allocated memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the entrepreneur will choose the spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;THouse.Create('My house');
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory layout:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]---
    1234My house
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep a variable with the address&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write the address to your new house down on a piece of paper. This paper will serve as your reference to your house. Without this piece of paper, you're lost, and cannot find the house, unless you're already in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var
    h: THouse;
begin
    h := THouse.Create('My house');
    ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory layout:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    h
    v
---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]---
    1234My house
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copy pointer value&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just write the address on a new piece of paper. You now have two pieces of paper that will get you to the same house, not two separate houses. Any attempts to follow the address from one paper and rearrange the furniture at that house will make it seem that &lt;em&gt;the other house&lt;/em&gt; has been modified in the same manner, unless you can explicitly detect that it's actually just one house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt; This is usually the concept that I have the most problem explaining to people, two pointers does not mean two objects or memory blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var
    h1, h2: THouse;
begin
    h1 := THouse.Create('My house');
    h2 := h1; // copies the address, not the house
    ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    h1
    v
---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]---
    1234My house
    ^
    h2
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freeing the memory&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demolish the house. You can then later on reuse the paper for a new address if you so wish, or clear it to forget the address to the house that no longer exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var
    h: THouse;
begin
    h := THouse.Create('My house');
    ...
    h.Free;
    h := nil;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I first construct the house, and get hold of its address. Then I do something to the house (use it, the ... code, left as an exercise for the reader), and then I free it. Lastly I clear the address from my variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory layout:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    h                        &amp;lt;--+
    v                           +- before free
---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]---          |
    1234My house             &amp;lt;--+

    h (now points nowhere)   &amp;lt;--+
                                +- after free
----------------------          | (note, memory might still
    xx34My house             &amp;lt;--+  contain some data)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dangling pointers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You tell your entrepreneur to destroy the house, but you forget to erase the address from your piece of paper. When later on you look at the piece of paper, you've forgotten that the house is no longer there, and goes to visit it, with failed results (see also the part about an invalid reference below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var
    h: THouse;
begin
    h := THouse.Create('My house');
    ...
    h.Free;
    ... // forgot to clear h here
    h.OpenFrontDoor; // will most likely fail
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;h&lt;/code&gt; after the call to &lt;code&gt;.Free&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; work, but that is just pure luck. Most likely it will fail, at a customers place, in the middle of a critical operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    h                        &amp;lt;--+
    v                           +- before free
---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]---          |
    1234My house             &amp;lt;--+

    h                        &amp;lt;--+
    v                           +- after free
----------------------          |
    xx34My house             &amp;lt;--+
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, h still points to the remnants of the data in memory, but
since it might not be complete, using it as before might fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory leak&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You lose the piece of paper and cannot find the house. The house is still standing somewhere though, and when you later on want to construct a new house, you cannot reuse that spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var
    h: THouse;
begin
    h := THouse.Create('My house');
    h := THouse.Create('My house'); // uh-oh, what happened to our first house?
    ...
    h.Free;
    h := nil;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we overwrote the contents of the &lt;code&gt;h&lt;/code&gt; variable with the address of a new house, but the old one is still standing... somewhere. After this code, there is no way to reach that house, and it will be left standing. In other words, the allocated memory will stay allocated until the application closes, at which point the operating system will tear it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory layout after first allocation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    h
    v
---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]---
    1234My house
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory layout after second allocation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
                       h
                       v
---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]
    1234My house       5678My house
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more common way to get this method is just to forget to free something, instead of overwriting it as above. In Delphi terms, this will occur with the following method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;procedure OpenTheFrontDoorOfANewHouse;
var
    h: THouse;
begin
    h := THouse.Create('My house');
    h.OpenFrontDoor;
    // uh-oh, no .Free here, where does the address go?
end;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this method has executed, there's no place in our variables that the address to the house exists, but the house is still out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory layout:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    h                        &amp;lt;--+
    v                           +- before losing pointer
---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]---          |
    1234My house             &amp;lt;--+

    h (now points nowhere)   &amp;lt;--+
                                +- after losing pointer
---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]---          |
    1234My house             &amp;lt;--+
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the old data is left intact in memory, and will not
be reused by the memory allocator. The allocator keeps track of which
areas of memory has been used, and will not reuse them unless you
free it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freeing the memory but keeping a (now invalid) reference&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demolish the house, erase one of the pieces of paper but you also have another piece of paper with the old address on it, when you go to the address, you won't find a house, but you might find something that resembles the ruins of one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you will even find a house, but it is not the house you were originally given the address to, and thus any attempts to use it as though it belongs to you might fail horribly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you might even find that a neighbouring address has a rather big house set up on it that occupies three address (Main Street 1-3), and your address goes to the middle of the house. Any attempts to treat that part of the large 3-address house as a single small house might also fail horribly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var
    h1, h2: THouse;
begin
    h1 := THouse.Create('My house');
    h2 := h1; // copies the address, not the house
    ...
    h1.Free;
    h1 := nil;
    h2.OpenFrontDoor; // uh-oh, what happened to our house?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the house was torn down, through the reference in &lt;code&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt;, and while &lt;code&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt; was cleared as well, &lt;code&gt;h2&lt;/code&gt; still has the old, out-of-date, address. Access to the house that is no longer standing might or might not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a variation of the dangling pointer above. See its memory layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buffer overrun&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You move more stuff into the house than you can possibly fit, spilling into the neighbours house or yard. When the owner of that neighbouring house later on comes home, he'll find all sorts of things he'll consider his own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the reason I chose a fixed-size array. To set the stage, assume that
the second house we allocate will, for some reason, be placed before the
first one in memory. In other words, the second house will have a lower
address than the first one. Also, they're allocated right next to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, this code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var
    h1, h2: THouse;
begin
    h1 := THouse.Create('My house');
    h2 := THouse.Create('My other house somewhere');
                         ^-----------------------^
                          longer than 10 characters
                         0123456789 &amp;lt;-- 10 characters
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory layout after first allocation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
                        h1
                        v
-----------------------[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]
                        5678My house
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory layout after second allocation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    h2                  h1
    v                   v
---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]----[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]
    1234My other house somewhereouse
                        ^---+--^
                            |
                            +- overwritten
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The part that will most often cause crash is when you overwrite important parts
of the data you stored that really should not be randomly changed. For instance
it might not be a problem that parts of the name of the h1-house was changed,
in terms of crashing the program, but overwriting the overhead of the
object will most likely crash when you try to use the broken object,
as will overwriting links that is stored to
other objects in the object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linked lists&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you follow an address on a piece of paper, you get to a house, and at that house there is another piece of paper with a new address on it, for the next house in the chain, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var
    h1, h2: THouse;
begin
    h1 := THouse.Create('Home');
    h2 := THouse.Create('Cabin');
    h1.NextHouse := h2;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we create a link from our home house to our cabin. We can follow the chain until a house has no &lt;code&gt;NextHouse&lt;/code&gt; reference, which means it's the last one. To visit all our houses, we could use the following code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var
    h1, h2: THouse;
    h: THouse;
begin
    h1 := THouse.Create('Home');
    h2 := THouse.Create('Cabin');
    h1.NextHouse := h2;
    ...
    h := h1;
    while h &amp;lt;&amp;gt; nil do
    begin
        h.LockAllDoors;
        h.CloseAllWindows;
        h := h.NextHouse;
    end;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory layout (added NextHouse as a link in the object, noted with
the four LLLL's in the below diagram):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    h1                      h2
    v                       v
---[ttttNNNNNNNNNNLLLL]----[ttttNNNNNNNNNNLLLL]
    1234Home       +        5678Cabin      +
                   |        ^              |
                   +--------+              * (no link)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In basic terms, what is a memory address?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A memory address is in basic terms just a number. If you think of memory
as a big array of bytes, the very first byte has the address 0, the next one
the address 1 and so on upwards. This is simplified, but good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this memory layout:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    h1                 h2
    v                  v
---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]
    1234My house       5678My house
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Might have these two address (the leftmost - is address 0):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;h1 = 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;h2 = 23&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which means that our linked list above might actuall look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    h1 (=4)                 h2 (=28)
    v                       v
---[ttttNNNNNNNNNNLLLL]----[ttttNNNNNNNNNNLLLL]
    1234Home      0028      5678Cabin     0000
                   |        ^              |
                   +--------+              * (no link)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is typical to store an address that "points nowhere" as a zero-address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In basic terms, what is a pointer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pointer is just a variable holding a memory address. You can typically ask the programming
language to give you its number, but most programming languages and runtimes tries to
hide the fact that there is a number beneath, just because the number itself does not
really hold any meaning to you. It is best to think of a pointer as a black box, ie.
you don't really know or care about how it is actually implemented, just as long as it
works.&lt;/p&gt;

Xcode is a suite of tools, only one of which is the IDE, so you don't have to use it if you don't want to.  (That said, if there are specific things you find clunky, please file a bug at &lt;a href="http://bugreport.apple.com/"&gt;Apple's bug reporter&lt;/a&gt; - every bug goes to engineering.)  Furthermore, installing Xcode will install both the Netwide Assembler (NASM) and the GNU Assembler (GAS); that will let you use whatever assembly syntax you're most comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll also want to take a look at the &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/CompilersDebuggers-date.html"&gt;Compiler &amp;amp; Debugging Guides&lt;/a&gt;, because those document the calling conventions used for the various architectures that Mac OS X runs on, as well as how the binary format and the loader work.  The IA-32 (x86-32) calling conventions in particular may be slightly different from what you're used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing to keep in mind is that the system call interface on Mac OS X is different from what you might be used to on DOS/Windows, Linux, or the other BSD flavors.  System calls aren't considered a stable API on Mac OS X; instead, you always go through libSystem.  That will ensure you're writing code that's portable from one release of the OS to the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, keep in mind that Mac OS X runs across a pretty wide array of hardware - everything from the 32-bit Core Single through the high-end quad-core Xeon.  By coding in assembly you might not be optimizing as much as you think; what's optimal on one machine may be pessimal on another.  Apple regularly measures its compilers and tunes their output with the "-Os" optimization flag to be decent across its line, and there are extensive vector/matrix-processing libraries that you can use to get high performance with hand-tuned CPU-specific implementations.&lt;/p&gt;

Both tools have domain columns where you can define a column template that you can apply to any table. When the domain changes so do the associated columns. ER/Studio also has trigger templates that you can build and apply to any table. This is how we update our LastUpdatedBy and LastUpdatedDate columns without having to build and maintain hundreds of trigger scripts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do create an audit table you would have one row for every row in every table that uses the audit table. That could get messy. In my opinion, you're better off putting the audit columns in every table. You also may want to put a timestamp column in all of your tables. You never know when concurrency becomes a problem. Our DB audit columns that we put in every table are: CreatedDt, LastUpdatedBy, LastUpdatedDt and Timestamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, compare two files (designated &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt;), and produce a patch file that can be used to upgrade the &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; file to have the same contents as the &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation would have to be relatively fast, and work with huge files. It should exhibit O(n) or O(logn) runtimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My own algorithms tend to either be lousy (fast but produce huge patches) or slow (produce small patches but have O(n^2) runtime).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice, or pointers for implementation would be nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the implementation will be used to keep servers in sync for various large datafiles that we have one master server for. When the master server datafiles change, we need to update several off-site servers as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most naive algorithm I have made, which only works for files that can be kept in memory, is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grab the first four bytes from the &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; file, call this the &lt;em&gt;key&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add those bytes to a dictionary, where &lt;em&gt;key -&gt; position&lt;/em&gt;, where &lt;em&gt;position&lt;/em&gt; is the position where I grabbed those 4 bytes, 0 to begin with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skip the first of these four bytes, grab another 4 (3 overlap, 1 one), and add to the dictionary the same way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat steps 1-3 for all 4-byte blocks in the &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the start of the &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; file, grab 4 bytes, and attempt to look it up in the dictionary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If found, find the longest match if there are several, by comparing bytes from the two files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encode a reference to that location in the &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; file, and skip the matched block in the &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If not found, encode 1 byte from the &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; file, and skip it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat steps 5-8 for the rest of the &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is somewhat like compression, without windowing, so it will use a lot of memory. It is, however, fairly fast, and produces quite small patches, as long as I try to make the codes output minimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more memory-efficient algorithm uses windowing, but produces much bigger patch files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are more nuances to the above algorithm that I skipped in this post, but I can post more details if necessary. I do, however, feel that I need a different algorithm altogether, so improving on the above algorithm is probably not going to get me far enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit #1&lt;/strong&gt;: Here is a more detailed description of the above algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, combine the two files, so that you have one big file. Remember the cut-point between the two files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, do that &lt;em&gt;grab 4 bytes and add their position to the dictionary&lt;/em&gt; step for everything in the whole file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, from where the &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; file starts, do the loop with attempting to locate an existing combination of 4 bytes, and find the longest match. Make sure we only consider positions from the old file, or from &lt;em&gt;earlier in the new file than we're currently at&lt;/em&gt;. This ensures that we can reuse material in both the old and the new file during patch application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit #2&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/lvknet/source/browse/trunk/LVK/IO/Patching/Binary/BinaryPatch.cs"&gt;Source code to the above algorithm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might get a warning about the certificate having some problems. I don't know how to resolve that so for the time being just accept the certificate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source uses lots of other types from the rest of my library so that file isn't all it takes, but that's the algorithm implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@lomaxx, I have tried to find a good documentation for the algorithm used in subversion, called xdelta, but unless you already know how the algorithm works, the documents I've found fail to tell me what I need to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps I'm just dense... :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a quick peek on the algorithm from that site you gave, and it is unfortunately not usable. A comment from the binary diff file says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Finding an optimal set of differences requires quadratic time relative to the input size, so it becomes unusable very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My needs aren't optimal though, so I'm looking for a more practical solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the answer though, added a bookmark to his utilities if I ever need them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit #1&lt;/strong&gt;: Note, I will look at his code to see if I can find some ideas, and I'll also send him an email later with questions, but I've read that book he references and though the solution is good for finding optimal solutions, it is impractical in use due to the time requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit #2&lt;/strong&gt;: I'll definitely hunt down the python xdelta implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Teifion's specific case, the phpBB DDL lists that particular field as NOT NULL, so there's no danger of incrementing NULL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the general case, you should not use NULL to represent zero.  Incrementing NULL &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; give an answer of NULL. If you're the kind of misguided developer who thinks NULL=0, step away from keyboard and find another pastime, you're just making life hard for the rest of us. Of course, this is the computer industry and who are we to say you're wrong? If you're not wrong, use&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$sql = "UPDATE skills SET level = COALESCE(level,0)+1 WHERE id = $id";
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...but let's face it: you're wrong. If everyone starts at level 0, then your DDL should include&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;level INT DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in case the programmers forget to set it when they create a record.  If not everyone starts on level 0, then skip the DEFAULT and force the programmer to supply a value on creation. If some people are beyond levels, for whom having a level is a meaningless thing, then adding one to their level equally has no meaning.  In that case, drop the NOT NULL from the DDL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've managed to get the services to run correctly for 3.0 and greater clients, but when I publish the services using a basicHttpBinding endpoint (which I believe is required for the compatibility I need), the service refactors my method signatures.  e.g.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public bool MethodToReturnTrue(string seedValue);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;appears to the client apps as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public void MethodToReturnTrue(string seedValue, out bool result, out bool MethodToReturnTrueResultSpecified);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've tried every configuration parameter I can think of in the app.config for my self-hosting console app, but I can't seem to make this function as expected.  I suppose this might lead to the fact that my expectations are flawed, but I'd be surprised that a WCF service is incapable of handling a bool return type to a down-level client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instant Messaging/Skype - Can act as both a basic in/out/busy system and a quick communication system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development Portal - A simple web page with links to important documentation or references for packages we use in each project and any other useful information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cruise Control - So we don't waste as much time pulling down and then worrying about broken builds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VNC - For the times I want to show someone code that has no business being checked into Git yet, or when I need to walk through a series of screens for critique/advice.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know of a cost effective (free) control to represent this type of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I'm looking for is a modified org-chart type chart/tree.  The modification is that any node should have 2 parent nodes (E.G. a child should have a Mother/Father).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution I've came up with so far is to have 2 trees, an ancestor tree and a descendants tree, with the individual being inspected as the root node for each tree.  It works, but is sort of clunky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm working primarily in c# WinForms, so .Net type controls or source code is preferrable.&lt;/p&gt;

1) Ensure that my include and library paths don't contain anything that I'm not expecting.
2) Do a "build clean" and then manually verify it, deleting any extra object files if necessary.
3) Make sure there aren't any hardcoded paths in include statements that don't mean what they meant when the project was originally rebuilt.&lt;/p&gt;

One nice way of working out the complexity of divide and conquer algorithms is the tree method. Let's say you have a version of quicksort with the median procedure, so you split the array into perfectly balanced subarrays every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now build a tree corresponding to all the arrays you work with. At the root you have the original array, the root has two children which are the subarrays. Repeat this until you have single element arrays at the bottom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we can find the median in O(n) time and split the array in two parts in O(n) time, the work done at each node is O(k) where k is the size of the array. Each level of the tree contains (at most) the entire array so the work per level is O(n) (the sizes of the subarrays add up to n, and since we have O(k) per level we can add this up). There are only log(n) levels in the tree since each time we halve the input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore we can upper bound the amount of work by O(n*log(n)). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Big O hides some details which we sometimes can't ignore. Consider computing the Fibonacci sequence with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a=0;&lt;br&gt;b=1;&lt;br&gt;for (i = 0; i &amp;lt;n; i++) {&lt;br&gt;    tmp = b;&lt;br&gt;    b = a + b;&lt;br&gt;    a = tmp;&lt;br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and lets just assume the a and b are BigIntegers in Java or something that can handle arbitrarily large numbers. Most people would say this is an O(n) algorithm without flinching. The reasoning is that you have n iterations in the for loop and O(1) work in side the loop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Fibonacci numbers are large, the n-th Fibonacci number is exponential in n so just storing it will take on the order of n bytes. Performing addition with big integers will take O(n) amount of work. So the total amount of work done in this procedure is &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n-1)/2 = O(n^2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://example.com/user/783&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then the assumption is that there are also users with IDs of 782, 781, ..., 2, and 1. Assuming that the web app in question is secure enough to prevent people entering other numbers to view other users without authorization, a simple sequentially-assigned surrogate key also "leaks" the total number of instances (older than this one), in this case users, which might be privileged information. (For instance, I am user #726 in stackoverflow.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uuid"&gt;UUID&lt;/a&gt;/GUID be a better solution? Then I could set up URLs like this:&lt;/p&gt;

The current code can be found &lt;a href="http://github.com/dbr/tvdb_api/tree/master/tvdb_api.py" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It grabs data from the API as requested, and has to store the data somehow, and make it available by doing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;print tvdbinstance[1][23]['episodename'] # get the name of episode 23 of season 1&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the "best" way to abstract this data within the Tvdb() class?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I originally used a extended Dict() that automatically created sub-dicts (so you could do &lt;code&gt;x[1][2][3][4] = "something"&lt;/code&gt; without having to do &lt;code&gt;if x[1].has_key(2): x[1][2] = []&lt;/code&gt; and so on)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I just stored the data by doing &lt;code&gt;self.data[show_id][season_number][episode_number][attribute_name] = "something"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This worked okay, but there was no easy way of checking if x[3][24] was supposed to exist or not (so I couldn't raise the season_not_found exception)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently it's using four classes. ShowContainer, Show, Season and Episode. Each one is a very basic dict, which I can easily add extra functionality in (the search() function on Show() for example). Each has a &lt;code&gt;__setitem__&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;__getitem_&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;has_key&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works mostly fine, I can check in Shows if it has that season in it's self.data dict, if not, raise season_not_found. Check in Season() if it has that episode and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem now is it's presenting itself as a dict, but doesn't have all the functionality, and because I'm overriding the &lt;em&gt;_getitem_&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;_setitem_&lt;/em&gt; functions, it's easy to accidently recursively call &lt;em&gt;_getitem_&lt;/em&gt; (so I'm not sure if extending the Dict class will cause problems)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other slight problem is adding data into the dict is a lot more work than the old Ddict method (which was &lt;code&gt;self.data[seas_no][ep_no]['attribute'] = 'something'&lt;/code&gt;). See _setItem and _setData. It's not too bad, since it's currently only a read-only API interface (so the users of the API should only ever retrieve data, not add more), but it's hardly.. elegant..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the series-of-classes system is probably the best way, but does anyone have a better idea for storing the data?

The database backup requirement is more interesting though, and one that I've come up against more than once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, I would want a text representation of the diff between two versions of a database (schema and data). Applying such a diff would take you from one version to the next. The source control engine could just store that with each commit. Rails migrations is a nifty way of handling schema diffs, but I haven't seen anything that can handle full schema and data diffs in a simple text format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failing that, I suppose you could check in a text database dump like the type the &lt;code&gt;mysqldump&lt;/code&gt; command for MySQL generates. The source control tool's diff algorithm probably won't handle it efficiently, but it's likely to require less space than checking in an opaque binary database file.&lt;/p&gt;" OwnerUserId="726" LastActivityDate="2008-08-08T15:54:55.303" CommentCount="0"/>

RESTful web services do not not use WSDL because the service can't be described by it, and the feeling is that REST is simpler and easier to understand. Some people have proposed &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language"&gt;WADL&lt;/a&gt; as a way to describe REST services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Languages like Python, Ruby and PHP make it easier to work with REST. the WSDL is used to generate C# code (a web service proxy) that can be easily called from a static language. This happens when you add a &lt;em&gt;Service Reference&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Web Reference&lt;/em&gt; in Visual Studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you provide SOAP or REST services depends on your user population. Whether the services are to be used over the internet or just inside your organization affects your choice. SOAP may have some features (WS-* standards) that work well for B2B or internal use, but suck for an internet service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Document/literal versus RPC for SOAP services are described on this &lt;a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-whichwsdl/"&gt;IBM DevelopWorks article&lt;/a&gt;. Document/literal is generally considered the best to use in terms of interoperability (Java to .NET etc). As to whether it is easier to support, that depends on your circumstances. My personal view is that people tend to make this stuff more complicated than it needs to be, and REST's simpler approach is superior.&lt;/p&gt;

The DLL currently has the database connection string hard coded, but I don't want to do this when we launch as the assembly can be disassembled and the username and password would be right there in the open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the requirements is that the password needs to be changed once every few months, so we would need to roll that out to our internal user base.&lt;/p&gt;

I understand that Applications can have their own config files, but I haven't seen anything on config files for DLLs.  Unfortunately, I can't get to the Jon Galloway post at work so I can't judge if that will work.  From a development standpoint, we don't want to use web services inhouse, but may be providing them to third parties sometime next year.  I don't think impersonation will work because we can't authenticate the user through the firewall.  As a user (or former user) can be an attacker, we're keeping it from everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Is this an ASP.NET app or a windows forms app running on multiple machines? &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If it's an ASP.NET app then just encrypt the connection strings section of your web.config.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If it's a client app running on multiple machines, instead of storing the connection string locally, consider using a web service or some other kind of secure mechanism to store it centrally. This would facilitate easier updates in the future and you're not storing the connection string locally.&lt;/P&gt;

That would avoid a fair bit of text duplication in this table (over 18,000 rows, an integer foreign key would save quite a bit of space over a varchar column).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you're still faced with a method for loading that Company table and then properly associating it with the rows in Location. There's no general solution, but you could do something along these lines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create the Company table, with an id column that auto-increments (depends on your RDBMS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find all of the unique company names and insert them into Company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a column, company_id, to Location that accepts NULLs (for now) and that is a foreign key of the Company.id column.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each row in Location, determine the corresponding company, and UPDATE that row's company_id column with that company's id. This is likely the most challenging step. If your data is like what you show in the example, you'll likely have to take many runs at this with various string matching approaches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once all rows in Location have a company_id value, then you can ALTER the Company table to add a NOT NULL constraint to the company_id column (assuming that every location &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; have a company, which seems reasonable).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can make a copy of your Location table, you can gradually build up a series of SQL statements to populate the company_id foreign key. If you make a mistake, you can just start over and rerun the script up to the point of failure.&lt;/p&gt;" OwnerUserId="726" LastActivityDate="2008-08-08T16:47:35.853" CommentCount="0"/>

There is a particular pattern I am thinking of that may help in this situation... it is called "Guards".  Rather than having tons of conditions, you can break them out into a guard, which makes it clear which are the adverse conditions in a method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for example, if you have a method that does something, but there are certain conditions where it shouldn't do something, rather than:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public void doSomething() {&lt;br&gt;    if (condition1 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; condition2 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; condition3 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; condition4) {&lt;br&gt;        // do something&lt;br&gt;    }&lt;br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could change it to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public void doSomething() {&lt;br&gt;    if (!condition1) {&lt;br&gt;        return;&lt;br&gt;    }&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    if (!condition2) {&lt;br&gt;        return;&lt;br&gt;    }&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    if (!condition3) {&lt;br&gt;        return;&lt;br&gt;    }&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    if (!condition4) {&lt;br&gt;        return;&lt;br&gt;    }&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    // do something&lt;br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a bit more verbose, but a lot more readable, especially when you start having weird nesting, the guard can help (combined with extracting methods).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "readability" solution is a style issue and as such is open to interpretation. My preference is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (var1 == true &amp;amp;&amp;amp; // Explanation of the check
    var2 == true &amp;amp;&amp;amp; // Explanation of the check
    var3 == true &amp;amp;&amp;amp; // Explanation of the check
    var4 == true &amp;amp;&amp;amp; // Explanation of the check
    var5 == true &amp;amp;&amp;amp; // Explanation of the check
    var6 == true)   // Explanation of the check
    { }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (var1 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; // Explanation of the check
    var2 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; // Explanation of the check
    var3 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; // Explanation of the check
    var4 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; // Explanation of the check
    var5 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; // Explanation of the check
    var6)   // Explanation of the check
    { }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, this kind of complex check can be quite difficult to mentally parse while scanning the code (especially if you are not the original author). Consider creating a helper method to abstract some of the complexity away:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/// &amp;lt;Summary&amp;gt;
/// Tests whether all the conditions are appropriately met
/// &amp;lt;/Summary&amp;gt;
private bool AreAllConditionsMet (
    bool var1,
    bool var2,
    bool var3,
    bool var4,
    bool var5,
    bool var6)
{
    return (
        var1 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; // Explanation of the check
        var2 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; // Explanation of the check
        var3 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; // Explanation of the check
        var4 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; // Explanation of the check
        var5 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; // Explanation of the check
        var6);  // Explanation of the check
}

private void SomeMethod()
{
    // Do some stuff (including declare the required variables)
    if (AreAllConditionsMet (var1, var2, var3, var4, var5, var6))
    {
        // Do something
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when visually scanning the "SomeMethod" method, the actual complexity of the test logic is hidden but the semantic meaning is preserved for humans to understand at a high-level. If the developer really needs to understand the details, the AreAllConditionsMet method can be examined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is formally known as the "Decompose Conditional" refactoring pattern I think. Tools like Resharper or Refactor Pro! can making doing this kind of refactoring easy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all cases, the key to having readable and understandable code is to use realistic variable names. While I understand this is a contrived example, "var1", "var2", etc are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; acceptable variable names.

&lt;p&gt;In the case you need more flexibility (progress bar, multiple file selection), then you can make use of flash to do this. You can use Javascript to interact with an invisible flash app which performs the file transfer. YUI's file upload control does this.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can't make UI control calls from a different thread than the one they were created on (the form's thread).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delegate invocations (ie, event hooks) are triggered on the same thread as the object that is firing the event. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you have a separate "engine" thread doing some work and have some UI watching for state changes which can be reflected in the UI (such as a progress bar or whatever), you have a problem. The engine fire's an object changed event which has been hooked by the Form. But the callback delegate that the Form registered with the engine gets called on the engine's thread not on the Form's thread. And so you can't update any controls from that callback. Doh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BeginInvoke&lt;/strong&gt; comes to the rescue. Just use this simple coding model in all your callback methods and you can be sure that things are going to be okay:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;private delegate void EventArgsDelegate(object sender, EventArgs ea);&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;void SomethingHappened(object sender, EventArgs ea)&lt;br&gt;{&lt;br&gt;   //&lt;br&gt;   // Make sure this callback is on the correct thread&lt;br&gt;   //&lt;br&gt;   if (this.InvokeRequired)&lt;br&gt;   {&lt;br&gt;      this.Invoke(new EventArgsDelegate(SomethingHappened), new object[] { sender, ea });&lt;br&gt;      return;&lt;br&gt;   }&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   //&lt;br&gt;   // Do something with the event such as update a control&lt;br&gt;   //&lt;br&gt;   textBox1.Text = "Something happened";&lt;br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's quite simple really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;strong&gt;InvokeRequired&lt;/strong&gt; to find out if this callback happened on the correct thread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If not, then reinvoke the callback on the correct thread with the same parameters. You can reinvoke a method by using the &lt;strong&gt;Invoke&lt;/strong&gt; (blocking) or &lt;strong&gt;BeginInvoke&lt;/strong&gt; (non-blocking) methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next time the function is called, &lt;strong&gt;InvokeRequired&lt;/strong&gt; returns false because we are now on the correct thread and everybody is happy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very compact way of addressing this problem and making your Forms safe from multi-threaded event callbacks.&lt;/p&gt;" OwnerUserId="756" LastActivityDate="2008-08-08T17:35:40.937" CommentCount="3"/>
  <row Id="6192" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="5349" CreationDate="2008-08-08T17:37:02.743" Score="4" Body="&lt;p&gt;This question used to be in the &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/memcached/wiki/FAQ" rel="nofollow"&gt;official FAQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080927061146/http://code.google.com/p/memcached/wiki/FAQ" rel="nofollow"&gt;What are some limits in memcached I might hit? (Wayback Machine)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The simple limits you will probably see with memcache are the key and 
  item size limits. Keys are restricted to 250 characters. Stored data 
  cannot exceed 1 megabyte in size, since that is the largest typical 
  slab size."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FAQ has now been revised and there are now two separate questions covering this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/memcached/wiki/FAQ#What_is_the_maxiumum_key_length?_%28250_bytes%29" rel="nofollow"&gt;What is the maxiumum key length? (250 bytes)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The maximum size of a key is 250 characters. Note this value will be
  less if you are using client "prefixes" or similar features, since the
  prefix is tacked onto the front of the original key. Shorter keys are
  generally better since they save memory and use less bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/memcached/wiki/FAQ#Why_are_items_limited_to_1_megabyte_in_size?" rel="nofollow"&gt;Why are items limited to 1 megabyte in size?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ahh, this is a popular question!&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Short answer: Because of how the memory allocator's algorithm works.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Long answer: Memcached's memory storage engine (which will be
  pluggable/adjusted in the future...), uses a slabs approach to memory
  management. Memory is broken up into slabs chunks of varying sizes,
  starting at a minimum number and ascending by a factorial up to the
  largest possible value.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Say the minimum value is 400 bytes, and the maximum value is 1
  megabyte, and the factorial is 1.20:&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;slab 1 - 400 bytes slab 2 - 480 bytes slab 3 - 576 bytes ... etc.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The larger the slab, the more of a gap there is between it and the
  previous slab. So the larger the maximum value the less efficient the
  memory storage is. Memcached also has to pre-allocate some memory for
  every slab that exists, so setting a smaller factorial with a larger
  max value will require even more overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;There're other reason why you wouldn't want to do that... If we're
  talking about a web page and you're attempting to store/load values
  that large, you're probably doing something wrong. At that size it'll
  take a noticeable amount of time to load and unpack the data structure
  into memory, and your site will likely not perform very well.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;If you really do want to store items larger than 1MB, you can
  recompile memcached with an edited &lt;code&gt;slabs.c:POWER_BLOCK&lt;/code&gt; value, or use
  the inefficient malloc/free backend. Other suggestions include a
  database, MogileFS, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It's no better, but what I've done in the past:&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;boolean ok = cond1;
     ok &amp;amp;= cond2;
     ok &amp;amp;= cond3;
     ok &amp;amp;= cond4;
     ok &amp;amp;= cond5;
     ok &amp;amp;= cond6;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Which is the same as:&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;ok = (cond1 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cond2 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cond3 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cond4 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cond5 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cond6);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, these two things are not the same in most languages.  The second expression will typically stop being evaluated as soon as one of the conditions is false, which can be a big performance improvement if evaluating the conditions is expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For readability, I personally prefer Mike Stone's proposal above.  It's easy to verbosely comment and preserves all of the computational advantages of being able to early out.  You can also do the same technique inline in a function if it'd confuse the organization of your code to move the conditional evaluation far away from your other function.  It's a bit cheesy, but you can always do something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;do {&lt;br&gt;    if (!cond1)&lt;br&gt;       break;&lt;br&gt;    if (!cond2)&lt;br&gt;       break;&lt;br&gt;    if (!cond3)&lt;br&gt;       break;&lt;br&gt;    ...&lt;br&gt;    DoSomething();&lt;br&gt;} while (false);&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the while (false) is kind of cheesy.  I wish languages had a scoping operator called "once" or something that you could break out of easily.&lt;/p&gt;" OwnerUserId="328" LastActivityDate="2008-08-08T17:37:12.943" CommentCount="0"/>

&lt;p&gt;For new installs, we have a metadata.sql file in the repository which holds all the DB schema, then in the build process we use this file to generate the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For updates, we add the updates in the software hardcoded. We keep it hardcoded because we don't like solving problems before it really IS a problem, and this kind of thing didn't prove to be a problem so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in our software we have something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;RegisterUpgrade(1, 'ALTER TABLE XX ADD XY CHAR(1) NOT NULL;');&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This code will check if the database is in version 1 (which is stored in a table created automatically), if it is outdated, then the command is executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To update the metadata.sql in the repository, we run this upgrades locally and then extract the full database metadata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing that happens every so often, is to forget commiting the metadata.sql, but this isn't a major problem because its easy to test on the build process and also the only thing that could happen is to make a new install with an outdated database and upgraded it on the first use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also we don't support downgrades, but it is by design, if something breaks on an update, we restored the previous version and fix the update before trying again.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The CLS was designed to be large enough to include the language
  constructs that are commonly needed by developers, yet small enough
  that most languages are able to support it. In addition, any language
  construct that makes it impossible to rapidly verify the type safety
  of code was excluded from the CLS so that all CLS-compliant languages
  can produce verifiable code if they choose to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: I did wonder about this some years back, and whilst I can't see why a UInt wouldn't be type safety verifiable, I guess the CLS guys had to have a cut off point somewhere as to what would be the baseline minimum number of value types supported. Also when you think about the longer term where more and more languages are being ported to the CLR why force them to implement unsigned ints to gain CLS compliance if there is absolutely no concept, ever?&lt;/p&gt;

Anyway, many APIs in the JDK pro-actively throws NullPointerException. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the Javadoc for Map.containsKey states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@throws NullPointerException if the key is null and this map
    does not permit null keys (optional).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's perfectly valid to throw your own NPE. The convention is to include the parameter name which was null in the message of the exception. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pattern goes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public void someMethod(Object mustNotBeNull) {

&lt;p&gt;Whatever you do, don't allow a bad value to get set and throw an exception later when other code attempts to use it. That makes debugging a nightmare. You should always the follow the "fail-fast" principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's our setup. Each developer has a virtual machine running our app and the MySQL database. It is their personal sandbox to do whatever they want. Currently, developers will make a change to the SQL schema and do a dump of the database to a text file that they commit into SVN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're wanting to deploy a continuous integration development server that will always be running the latest committed code. If we do that now, it will reload the database from SVN for each build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a test (virtual) server that runs "release candidates." Deploying to the test server is currently a very manual process, and usually involves me loading the latest SQL from SVN and tweaking it. Also, the data on the test server is inconsistent. You end up with whatever test data the last developer to commit had on his sandbox server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where everything breaks down is the deployment to production. Since we can't overwrite the live data with test data, this involves manually re-creating all the schema changes. If there were a large number of schema changes or conversion scripts to manipulate the data, this can get really hairy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the problem was just the schema, It'd be an easier problem, but there is "base" data in the database that is updated during development as well, such as meta-data in security and permissions tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the biggest barrier I see in moving toward continuous integration and one-step-builds. How do &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; solve it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A follow-up question: how do you track database versions so you know which scripts to run to upgrade a given database instance? Is a version table like Lance mentions below the standard procedure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the reference to Tarantino. I'm not in a .NET environment, but I found their &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/tarantino/wiki/DatabaseChangeManagement"&gt;DataBaseChangeMangement wiki page&lt;/a&gt; to be very helpful. Especially this &lt;a href="http://tarantino.googlecode.com/svn/docs/Database-Change-Management.ppt"&gt;Powerpoint Presentation (.ppt)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm going to write a Python script that checks the names of &lt;code&gt;*.sql&lt;/code&gt; scripts in a given directory against a table in the database and runs the ones that aren't there in order based on a integer that forms the first part of the filename. If it is a pretty simple solution, as I suspect it will be, then I'll post it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've got a working script for this. It handles initializing the DB if it doesn't exist and running upgrade scripts as necessary. There are also switches for wiping an existing database and importing test data from a file. It's about 200 lines, so I won't post it (though I might put it on pastebin if there's interest).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm working to implement an export feature for events. The link above lists tons of clients that support the ICalendar standard, but the "three big ones" I can see are Apple's iCal, Microsoft's Outlook, and Google's Gmail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm starting to get the feeling that each of these client implement different parts of the "standard", and I'm unsure of what pieces of information we should be trying to export from the application so that someone can put it on their calendar (especially around recurrence).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, from what I understand Outlook doesn't support hourly recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could any of you provide guidance of the "happy medium" here from a features implementation standpoint?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondary question, if we decide to cut features from the export (such as hourly recurrence) because it isn't supported in Outlook, should we support it in the application as well? (it is a general purpose event scheduling application, with no business specific use in mind...so we really are looking for the happy medium).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, here's an update. A coworker suggested I update JAVA_OPTS in my /etc/profile to include "-Duser.timezone=US/Pacific", which worked (I also saw CATALINA_OPTS, which I updated as well). Actually, I just exported the change into the variables rather than use the new /etc/profile (a reboot later will pick up the changes and I will be golden).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I still think there is a better solution... there should be a configuration for Java somewhere that says what timezone it is using, or how it is grabbing the timezone. If someone knows such a setting, that would be awesome, but for now this is a decent workaround.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am using 1.5, and it is most definitely a DST problem.  As you can see, the time zone is set to not use daylight savings.  My belief is it is generically set to -8 offset rather than the specific Pacific timezone.  Since the generic -8 offset has no daylight savings info, it's of course not using it, but the question is, where do I tell Java to use Pacific time zone when it starts up?  I'm NOT looking for a programmatic solution, it should be a configuration solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As has been pointed out, when realloc() is called, you can potentially change the pointer to the memory being reallocated. When this happens, the argument "string" becomes invalid. Even if you reassign it, the change goes out of scope once the function ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer the OP, realloc() returns a pointer to the newly-reallocated memory. The return value needs to be stored somewhere. Generally, you would do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;data *foo = malloc(SIZE * sizeof(data));&lt;br&gt;data *bar = realloc(foo, NEWSIZE * sizeof(data));&lt;br&gt;/* Test bar for safety before blowing away foo */&lt;br&gt;if (bar != NULL)&lt;br&gt;{&lt;br&gt;   foo = bar;&lt;br&gt;   bar = NULL;&lt;br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;else&lt;br&gt;{&lt;br&gt;   fprintf(stderr, "Crap. Memory error.\n");&lt;br&gt;   free(foo);&lt;br&gt;   exit(-1);&lt;br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As TyBoer points out, you guys can't change the value of the pointer being passed in as the input to this function. You can assign whatever you want, but the change will go out of scope at the end of the function. In the following block, "input" may or may not be an invalid pointer once the function completes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void foobar(char *input, int newlength)&lt;br&gt;{&lt;br&gt;   /* Here, I ignore my own advice to save space. Check your return values! */&lt;br&gt;   input = realloc(input, newlength * sizeof(char));&lt;br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark tries to work around this by returning the new pointer as the output of the function. If you do that, the onus is on the caller to never again use the pointer he used for input. If it matches the return value, then you have two pointers to the same spot and only need to call free() on one of them. If they don't match, the input pointer now points to memory that may or may not be owned by the process. Dereferencing it could cause a segmentation fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could use a double pointer for the input, like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void foobar(char **input, int newlength)&lt;br&gt;{&lt;br&gt;   *input = realloc(*input, newlength * sizeof(char));&lt;br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the caller has a duplicate of the input pointer somewhere, that duplicate still might be invalid now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the cleanest solution here is to avoid using realloc() when trying to modify the function caller's input. Just malloc() a new buffer, return that, and let the caller decide whether or not to free the old text. This has the added benefit of letting the caller keep the original string!&lt;/p&gt;" OwnerUserId="773" LastActivityDate="2008-08-08T21:37:38.887" CommentCount="0"/>

&lt;p&gt;Although of course tempObject and result are transient values you can never see (they're implementation details in the interpreter), and there is no JS mechanism to do the "is not an object" check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking the "new function() { .. }" method will be slower due to the need to create the this object for the constructor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said this should be not be a real difference as object allocation is not slow, and you shouldn't be using such code in hot code (due to the cost of creating the function object and associated closure).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what, you're probably going to have to do some of this by hand, but you may be able to automate the bulk of it. For the example locations you gave, a query like the following would set the appropriate company_id value:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;UPDATE  Location&lt;br&gt;SET     Company_ID = 1&lt;br&gt;WHERE   (LOWER(Location_Name) LIKE '%to_n shop%'&lt;br&gt;OR      LOWER(Location_Name) LIKE '%tts%')&lt;br&gt;AND     Company_ID IS NULL;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that would match your examples (I added the &lt;code&gt;IS NULL&lt;/code&gt; part to not overwrite previously set Company_ID values), but of course in 18,000 rows you're going to have to be pretty inventive to handle the various combinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something else that might help would be to use the names in Company to generate queries like the one above. You could do something like the following (in MySQL):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT  CONCAT('UPDATE Location SET Company_ID = ',&lt;br&gt;        Company_ID, ' WHERE LOWER(Location_Name) LIKE ',&lt;br&gt;        LOWER(REPLACE(Company_Name), ' ', '%'), ' AND Company_ID IS NULL;')&lt;br&gt;FROM    Company;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What if an odd number of quotes appear
  in the original string?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This looks uncannily like CSV parsing, which has some peculiarities to handling quoted fields. The field is only escaped if the field is delimited with double quotations, so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;field1, "field2, field3", field4, "field5, field6" field7&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"field5&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;field6" field7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice if it doesn't both start and end with a quotation, then it's not a quoted field and the double quotes are simply treated as double quotes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;@palmsey: In fairness to the OP, the javascript docs actually explicitly refer to using variables of type Object in this manner as "associative arrays".&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in fairness to @palmsey he was quite correct, they aren't associative arrays, they're definitely objects :) - doing the job of an associative array. But as regards the wider point you definitely seem to have the right of it according to this rather fine article I found: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But according to all this, isn't the &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5223/length-of-javascript-associative-array#5234" rel="nofollow"&gt;accepted answer&lt;/a&gt; itself bad practice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specify a prototype size() function for Object&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anything else has been added to Object .prototype, then the suggested code will fail:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script type="text/javascript"&amp;gt;
Object.prototype.size = function () {
  var len = this.length ? --this.length : -1;
    for (var k in this)
      len++;
  return len;
}
Object.prototype.size2 = function () {
  var len = this.length ? --this.length : -1;
    for (var k in this)
      len++;
  return len;
}
var myArray = new Object();
myArray["firstname"] = "Gareth";
myArray["lastname"] = "Simpson";
myArray["age"] = 21;
alert("age is " + myArray["age"]);
alert("length is " + myArray.size());
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think that answer should be the accepted one as it can't be trusted to work if you have any other code running in the same execution context. To do it in a robust fashion surely you would need to define the size method within myArray and check for the type of the members as you iterate through them.&lt;/p&gt;" OwnerUserId="137" LastEditorUserId="1" LastEditorDisplayName="Jeff Atwood" LastEditDate="2008-08-09T08:46:38.927" LastActivityDate="2008-08-09T08:46:38.927" CommentCount="0"/>

    &lt;p&gt;@Flubba, does this allow me to have folders inside my include directory? flat include directories give me nightmares. as the whole objects directory should be in the inc directory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, absolutely. So for example, we use a single layer of subfolders, generally:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;require_once('library/string.class.php')&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to be careful with relying on the include path too much in really high traffic sites, because php has to hunt through the current directory and then all the directories on the include path in order to see if your file is there and this can slow things up if you're getting hammered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for example if you're doing MVC, you'd put the path to your application directoy in the include path and then specify refer to things in the form&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;'model/user.class'&lt;br&gt;'controllers/front.php'&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But generally speaking, it just lets you work with really short paths in your PHP that will work from anywhere and it's a lot easier to read than all that realpath document root malarkey. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit of those script-based alternatives others have suggested is they work anywhere, even on shared boxes; setting the include path requires a little more thought and effort but as I mentioned lets you start using __autoload which just the coolest.&lt;/p&gt;" OwnerUserId="137" LastActivityDate="2008-08-08T23:17:12.273" CommentCount="0"/>

Check your employment agreement or service agreement if there's a possibility you're in such a situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

These days many Open Source projects have such assignments, so that all rights to the code in the project can be owned by the project itself and/or its sponsor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these are important when it comes to protecting yourself, the project, and anyone who wants to use or build on the project downstream from claims related to the code you wrote.&lt;/p&gt;" OwnerUserId="714" LastActivityDate="2008-08-09T00:22:37.383" CommentCount="0"/>

&lt;p&gt;Both are anonymous functions and execute in the exact same way. But, the difference between the two is that in the second case scope of the variables is restricted to the anonymous function itself. There is no chance of accidentally adding variables to the global scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This implies that by using the second method, you are not cluttering up the global variables scope which is good as these global variable values can interfere with some other global variables that you may use in some other library or are being used in a third party library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script type="text/javascript"&amp;gt;

new function() { 
a = "Hello";
alert(a + " Inside Function");
};

alert(a + " Outside Function");

(function() { 
var b = "World";
alert(b + " Inside Function");
})();

alert(b + " Outside Function");
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above code the output is something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hello Inside Function&lt;br&gt;
  Hello Outside Function&lt;br&gt;
  World Inside Function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... then, you get an error as 'b' is not defined outside the function!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, I believe that the second method is better... safer!&lt;/p&gt;

The top left entry stores the "amplitude" the "base" frequency and frequency increases both along the horizontal and vertical axes. The outcome of the DCT is usually a collection of amplitudes at the more usual lower frequencies (the top left quadrant) and less entries at the higher frequencies. As lassevk mentioned, it is usual to just zero out these higher frequencies as they typically constitute very minor parts of the source. However, this does result in loss of information. To complete the compression it is usual to use a lossless compression over the DCT'd source. This is where the compression comes in as all those runs of zeros get packed down to almost nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possible advantage of using the DCT to find similar regions is that you can do a first pass match on low frequency values (top-left corner). This reduces the number of values you need to match against. If you find matches of low frequency values, you can increase into comparing the higher frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, either you keep your product installers safe or start a new build from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also IMO the only way to replicated the exact same build in the future is to run your build machine on a Virtual Machine and keep the VM backup around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that most softwares you will need to replicate the exact same build in the future will not be available anymore, so you will need to keep a copy of every software versio you install in this machine.&lt;/p&gt;

But again, these aren't the all encompassing things you were looking for but they will shed some light on things you might want to look into.  &lt;a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000976.html"&gt;Coding Horror's Visual Joins&lt;/a&gt; article and &lt;a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/performance-tuning-best-practices-for-mysql/"&gt;Video on Performance Tuning and Best Practices&lt;/a&gt;.  I think if you see those now, that when you do find a book or something and you get introduced those topics that things will click pretty easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be aware of the documentation for your dialect of SQL and use it often.  I am not ashamed of the fact that whenever I need to run SQL I open up the &lt;a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/sql-syntax.html"&gt;MySQL documentation&lt;/a&gt; and I check the syntax, string functions, etc.  Although SQL statements typically don't change much between different SQL dialects (Microsoft, Mysql, Oracle) there are small differences that will catch you if you aren't careful.  Be aware that these differences exist, so if you're doing something on one SQL server that you know should have worked, these small "gotchas" might be the cause of errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However you go about doing it be sure that you're actively trying out the SQL statements.  Any decent Database Engine has a console (I know MySQL and Oracle do).  If you ever come across a situation where you think, "What happens if I do this" do it!  &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; statements won't alter your database.  You will also probably have ideas with other statements, &lt;code&gt;INSERT&lt;/code&gt;, etc. make a test database with some very simple tables and hack away.  I feel that, especially with SQL, you learn a lot more by &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt;, then my book learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, SQL isn't hard if you know it.  Investing the time to learn it correctly (like you seem to be interested in doing) is the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

PS: My memory is a bit hazy on this so apologies if I'm wrong&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;instead of break/continue, it has break/next, which behave the same in terms of loops&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loops (like everything else) are expressions, and "return" the last thing that they did. Most of the time, getting the return value from a loop is pointless, so everyone just does this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a = 5&lt;br&gt;while a &amp;lt; 10&lt;br&gt;    a + 1&lt;br&gt;end&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can however do this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a = 5&lt;br&gt;b = while a &amp;lt; 10&lt;br&gt;    a + 1&lt;br&gt;end # b is now 10&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOWEVER, a lot of ruby code 'emulates' a loop by using a block.
The canonical example is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;10.times do |x|&lt;br&gt;    puts x&lt;br&gt;end&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it is much more common for people to want to do things with the result of a block, this is where it gets messy.
break/next mean different things in the context of a block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;break will jump out of the code that called the block&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;next will skip the rest of the code in the block, and 'return' what you specify to the caller of the block. This doesn't make any sense without examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def timesten&lt;br&gt;    10.times{ |t| puts yield t }&lt;br&gt;end&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;timesten do |x|&lt;br&gt;   x * 2&lt;br&gt;end&lt;br&gt;# will print&lt;br&gt;2&lt;br&gt;4&lt;br&gt;6&lt;br&gt;8 ... and so on&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;timesten do |x|&lt;br&gt;    break&lt;br&gt;    x * 2&lt;br&gt;end&lt;br&gt;# won't print anything. The break jumps out of the timesten function entirely, and the call to `puts` inside it gets skipped&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;timesten do |x|&lt;br&gt;    break 5&lt;br&gt;    x * 2&lt;br&gt;end&lt;br&gt;# This is the same as above. it's "returning" 5, but nobody is catching it. If you did a = timesten... then a would get assigned to 5&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;timesten do |x|&lt;br&gt;    next 5&lt;br&gt;    x * 2&lt;br&gt;end &lt;br&gt;# this would print&lt;br&gt;5&lt;br&gt;5&lt;br&gt;5 ... and so on, because 'next 5' skips the 'x * 2' and 'returns' 5.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, first it would depend on if I can tell if they are broken or not from the floor I am dropping them at.  I will presume I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would go up to the second floor, drop the first marble.  If it broke I would try the first floor.  If that broke I would know it was no floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the first didn't break, I would go to the 4th floor and drop from there.  If that broke, I would go back down and get the other marble, then drop at the 3rd floor, breaking or not I would know which is the limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If neither broke, I would go get both, and do the same process, this time starting at the 6th floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way, I can skip every other floor until I get a marble that breaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be optimized for if the marble breaks early... I suppose there is probably an optimal amount of floors I could skip to get the most for each skip... but then if one breaks, I would have to check each floor individually from the first floor above the last known floor... which of course would be a pain if I skipped too many floors (sorry, not going to figure out the optimal solution right now).&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe even throw in some statistics and start at the 25th floor instead of the 50th floor so that you're worst case scenario would be 24 instead of 49.&lt;/p&gt;

Simply speaking, when an object is referred to (ie, stored somewhere), it gets "retained" which means its reference count is increased by one. When an object is no longer needed, it is "released" which means its reference count is decreased by one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When an object's reference count is 0, the object is freed. This is basic reference counting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some languages, references are automatically increased and decreased, but objective-c is not one of those languages. Thus the programmer is responsible for retaining and releasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical way to write a method is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;id myVar = [someObject someMessage];&lt;br&gt;.... do something ....;&lt;br&gt;[myVar release];&lt;br&gt;return someValue;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem of needing to remember to release any acquired resources inside of code is both tedious and error-prone. Objective-C introduces another concept aimed at making this much easier: Autorelease Pools. Autorelease pools are special objects that are installed on each thread. They are a fairly simple class, if you look up NSAutoreleasePool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When an object gets an "autorelease" message sent to it, the object will look for any autorelease pools sitting on the stack for this current thread. It will add the object to the list as an object to send a "release" message to at some point in the future, which is generally when the pool itself is released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking the code above, you can rewrite it to be shorter and easier to read by saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;id myVar = [[someObject someMessage] autorelease];&lt;br&gt;... do something ...;&lt;br&gt;return someValue;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the object is autoreleased, we no longer need to explicitly call "release" on it. This is because we know some autorelease pool will do it for us later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this helps. The Wikipedia article is pretty good about reference counting. More information about &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Concepts/AutoreleasePools.html"&gt;autorelease pools can be found here&lt;/a&gt;. Also note that if you are building for Mac OS X 10.5 and later, you can tell Xcode to build with garbage collection enabled, allowing you to completely ignore retain/release/autorelease.&lt;/p&gt;" OwnerUserId="457" LastActivityDate="2008-08-09T03:48:10.417" CommentCount="1"/>

&lt;p&gt;If you personally alloc/init an object, it comes with a reference count of 1. You are responsible for cleaning up after it when it's no longer needed, either by calling [foo release] or [foo autorelease]. release cleans it up right away, whereas autorelease adds the object to the autorelease pool, which will automatically release it at a later time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;autorelease is primarily for when you have a method that needs to return the object in question (so you can't manually release it, else you'll be returning a nil object) but you don't want to hold on to it, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you acquire an object where you did not call alloc/init to get it -- for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;foo = [NSString stringWithString:@"hello"];&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but you want to hang on to this object, you need to call [foo retain]. Otherwise, it's possible it will get autoreleased and you'll be holding on to a nil reference (as it would in the above stringWithString example).

&lt;p&gt;In Cocoa, each object keeps track of how many times it is being referenced (specifically, the &lt;code&gt;NSObject&lt;/code&gt; base class implements this).  By calling &lt;code&gt;retain&lt;/code&gt; on an object, you are telling it that you want to up its reference count by one.  By calling &lt;code&gt;release&lt;/code&gt;, you tell the object you are letting go of it, and its reference count is decremented.  If, after calling &lt;code&gt;release&lt;/code&gt;, the reference count is now zero, then that object's memory is freed by the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic way this differs from &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; is that any given object doesn't need to worry about other parts of the system crashing because you've freed memory they were using.  Assuming everyone is playing along and retaining/releasing according to the rules, when one piece of code retains and then releases the object, any other piece of code also referencing the object will be unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can sometimes be confusing is knowing the circumstances under which you should call &lt;code&gt;retain&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;release&lt;/code&gt;.  My general rule of thumb is that if I want to hang on to an object for some length of time (if it's a member variable in a class, for instance), then I need to make sure the object's reference count knows about me.  As described above, an object's reference count is incremented by calling &lt;code&gt;retain&lt;/code&gt;.  By convention, it is also incremented (set to 1, really) when the object is created with an "init" method.  In either of these cases, it is my responsibility to call &lt;code&gt;release&lt;/code&gt; on the object when I'm done with it.  If I don't, there will be a memory leak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of object creation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;NSString* s = [[NSString alloc] init];  // Ref count is 1
[s retain];                             // Ref count is 2 - silly
                                        //   to do this after init
[s release];                            // Ref count is back to 1
[s release];                            // Ref count is 0, object is freed
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for &lt;code&gt;autorelease&lt;/code&gt;.  Autorelease is used as a convenient (and sometimes necessary) way to tell the system to free this object up after a little while.  From a plumbing perspective, when &lt;code&gt;autorelease&lt;/code&gt; is called, the current thread's &lt;code&gt;NSAutoreleasePool&lt;/code&gt; is alerted of the call.  The &lt;code&gt;NSAutoreleasePool&lt;/code&gt; now knows that once it gets an opportunity (after the current iteration of the event loop), it can call &lt;code&gt;release&lt;/code&gt; on the object.  From our perspective as programmers, it takes care of calling &lt;code&gt;release&lt;/code&gt; for us, so we don't have to (and in fact, we shouldn't).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's important to note is that (again, by convention) all object creation &lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt; methods return an autoreleased object.  For example, in the following example, the variable "s" has a reference count of 1, but after the event loop completes, it will be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;NSString* s = [NSString stringWithString:@"Hello World"];
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to hang onto that string, you'd need to call &lt;code&gt;retain&lt;/code&gt; explicitly, and then explicitly &lt;code&gt;release&lt;/code&gt; it when you're done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the following (very contrived) bit of code, and you'll see a situation where &lt;code&gt;autorelease&lt;/code&gt; is required:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- (NSString*)createHelloWorldString
{
    NSString* s = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello World"];

    // Now what?  We want to return s, but we've upped its reference count.
    // The caller shouldn't be responsible for releasing it, since we're the
    // ones that created it.  If we call release, however, the reference 
    // count will hit zero and bad memory will be returned to the caller.  
    // The answer is to call autorelease before returning the string.  By 
    // explicitly calling autorelease, we pass the responsibility for
    // releasing the string on to the thread's NSAutoreleasePool, which will
    // happen at some later time.  The consequence is that the returned string 
    // will still be valid for the caller of this function.
    return [s autorelease];
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the other significant changes I was looking at at the time was the change of the default handling of function parameters. In PHP4 if I remember, they were pass-by-copy unless you specified otherwise, but in PHP5 is changed to pass-by-reference by default. In well written code, that probably won't make a big difference to you, but it could certainly cause problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think one other thing I found changed is that objects are no longer allowed to overwrite their 'this' field.

&lt;p&gt;If you just need a simple way to store config information, I would recommend a config file, using INI or XML as the format. I suggest using the registry only if there is something specific you want to get out of using the registry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use one of these two methods:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html#getResource%28java.lang.String%29"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Class.getResource(String)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;InputStream inputStream = 
                YourClass.class.getResourceAsStream("image.jpg");
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The long answer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, one would not want to load files using absolute paths. For example, dont do this if you can help it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;File file = new File("C:\\Users\\Joe\\image.jpg");
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technique is not recommended for at least two reasons. First, it creates a dependency on a particular operating system, which prevents the application from easily moving to another operating system. One of Javas main benefits is the ability to run the same bytecode on many different platforms. Using an absolute path like this makes the code much less portable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, depending on the relative location of the file, this technique might create an external dependency and limit the applications mobility. If the file exists outside the applications current directory, this creates an external dependency and one would have to be aware of the dependency in order to move the application to another machine (error prone).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, use the &lt;code&gt;getResource()&lt;/code&gt; methods in the &lt;code&gt;Class&lt;/code&gt; class. This makes the application much more portable. It  can be moved to different platforms, machines, or directories and still function correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, you're right, I guess PHP must convert array index strings to numbers if they contain only digits. I tried this code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $array = array('1' =&amp;gt; 100, '2' =&amp;gt; 200, 1 =&amp;gt; 300, 2 =&amp;gt; 400);
 print_r($array);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the output was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; Array([1] =&amp;gt; 300 [2] =&amp;gt; 400)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've done some more tests and found that if an array index (or key) is made up of only digits, it's always converted to an integer, otherwise it's a string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ejunker:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you explain why that's faster? Doesn't it take the interpreter an extra step to parse "$index" into the string to use as an index instead of just using $index as the index?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performance wise, $index should be faster than "$index" and "{$index}" (which are the same).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you start a double-quote string, PHP will go into interpolation mode and treat it as a string first, but looking for variable markers ($, {}, etc) to replace from the local scope.  This is why in most discussions, true 'static' strings should always be single quotes unless you need the escape-shortcuts like "\n" or "\t", because PHP will not need to try to interpolate the string at runtime and the full string can be compiled statically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to http://php.net/types.array, an array index can only be an integer or a string. If you try to use a float as an index, it will truncate it to integer. So if $index is a float with the value 3.14, then $array[$index] will evaluate to $array[3] and $array["$index"] will evaluate to $array['3.14']. Here is some code that confirms this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $array = array(3.14 =&amp;gt; 'float', '3.14' =&amp;gt; 'string');&lt;br&gt; print_r($array);&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; $index = 3.14;&lt;br&gt; echo $array[$index]."\n";&lt;br&gt; echo $array["$index"]."\n";&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think one of the biggest points I would ensure is that they understand the core concepts of a framework. I know you are working in Python (which I have no clue about) but for example, with ASP.NET getting people to understand the page/code behind model can be a real challenge, but its &lt;strong&gt;critical&lt;/strong&gt; that they understand it. As an example, I recently had a question on a forum about "&lt;em&gt;where do I put my data-access code, in the 'cs' file or the 'aspx' file&lt;/em&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I would say, for the most part, let them guide the way, just be there to support them where needed, and prompt more questions to maintain interest. Just ensure they have the fundamentals down, and dont let them run before they can walk.&lt;/p&gt;

Regardless of the decision, it is pretty trivial to run both.  TestNG strives to be much more configurable than JUnit, but in the end they both work equally well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TestNG has a neat feature where you can mark tests as a particular group, and then easily run all tests of a specific group, or exclude tests of a particular group.  Thus you can mark tests that run slowly as in the "slow" group and then ignore them when you want quick results.  A suggestion from their documentation is to mark some subset as "checkin" tests which should be run whenever you check new files in.  I never saw such a feature in JUnit, but then again, if you don't have it, you don't REALLY miss it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then go back to my client application and want to utilise the &lt;code&gt;BuyContactNewHat&lt;/code&gt; method, so I add a reference to my &lt;em&gt;Utils&lt;/em&gt; namespace and there it is. However, a problem arises with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Contact c = MyWebService.GetContact("Rob);
Utils.BuyContactNewHat(c); // &amp;lt;&amp;lt; Error Here
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the return type of &lt;code&gt;GetContact&lt;/code&gt; is of &lt;code&gt;MyWebService.Contact&lt;/code&gt; and not &lt;code&gt;Business.Contact&lt;/code&gt; as expected. I understand why this is, because when accessing a web service, you are actually programming against the proxy class generated by the WSDL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, is there an "easier" way to deal with this type mismatch? I was considering perhaps trying to create a generic converter class that uses reflection to ensure two objects have the same structure, than simply transferring the values across from one to the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are fairly easy to use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, design your master page and define where you want the content to be placed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;%@ Master ... %&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;%-- HTML code --%&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;asp:ContentPlaceHolder id="plhMainContent" runat="server" /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;%-- HTML code --%&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can have any number of place holders, just give them proper identifiers because you'll need them later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then when creating an &lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;aspx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; page, you will need to mention which master page to use and in which place holder to put what content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;%@ Page ... master="~/MasterPage.master" ... %&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;asp:Content ID="ContentIdentifier" ContentPlaceholderid="plhMainContent" runat="server"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;%-- More HTML here --%&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;%-- Insert web controls here --%&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/asp:content&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just make sure you link to the correct master page and that your content refers to the correct place holder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Master pages save a lot of time and are very powerful. There are tutorials out there, learn the power of place holders and web controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where I work we use master pages and web controls extensively for some major corporations, it gives us an edge when comparing with what other companies can offer.&lt;/p&gt;

A problem is better solved with OOP when you are better at solving problems and thinking in an OO mentality.  Object Orientation is just another tool which has come along through trying to make computing a better tool for solving problems.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it can allow for better code reuse, and can also lead to neater code.  But quite often these highly praised qualities are, in-relity, of little real value.  Applying OO techniques to an existing functional application could really cause a lot of problems.  The skill lies in learning many different techniques and applying the most appropriate to the problem at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OO is often quoted as a Nirvana like solution to the software development, where many times it is not appropriate to be applied to the issue at hand.  It can, quite often, lead to overengineering of a problem to reach the perfect solution, when often it is really not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, OOP is not really Object Oriented Programming, but mapping Object Oriented Thinking to a programming language capable of supporting OO Techniques.  OO Techniques can be supported by languages which are not inherently OO, and there are techniques you can use within functional languages to take advantage of benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, I have been developing OO software for about 20 years now, so I tend to think in OO terms when solving problems, irrespective of the language I am writing in.  Currently I am implementing polymorphism using Perl 5.6, which does not natively support it.  I have chosen to do this as it will make maintenance and extension of the code a simple configuration task, rather than a development issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure if this is clear.  There aare people who are hard in the OO court, and there are people who are hard in the Functional court.  And then there are people who have tried both and try to take the best from each.  Neither is perfect, but both have some very good traits that you can utilise no matter what the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are trying to learn OOP, don't just concentrate on OOP, but try to utilise Object Oriented Analysis and general OO principles to the whole spectrum of the problem solution.&lt;/p&gt;

Determine what the values of your ETag and Last-Modified headers would be in that response and use them to make the decision.  Hopefully you have built your system such that determining this is less costly than constructing the complete response.&lt;/p&gt;

In that case, the individual concatenation operations might even be combined into a single operation by the compiler.

&lt;p&gt;I've found that, in cases where I'm building strings in a fairly linear fashion, either doing straight concatenations or using StringBuilder is your best option.  I suggest this in cases where the majority of the string that you're building is dynamic.  Since very little of the text is static, the most important thing is that it's clear where each piece of dynamic text is being put in case it needs updated in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you're talking about a big chunk of static text with two or three variables in it, even if it's a little less efficient, I think the clarity you gain from string.Format makes it worth it.  I used this earlier this week when having to place one bit of dynamic text in the center of a 4 page document.  It'll be easier to update that big chunk of text if its in one piece than having to update three pieces that you concatenate together.&lt;/p&gt;" OwnerUserId="111" LastActivityDate="2008-08-09T14:40:00.650" CommentCount="1"/>

&lt;p&gt;Overview:  a .xfdl file is a gzipped .xml file which has then been encoded in base64.  I wish to de-encode the .xfdl into xml which I can then modify and then re-encode back into a .xfdl file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;xfdl &gt; xml.gz &gt; xml &gt; xml.gz &gt; xfdl&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been able to take a .xfdl file and de-encode it from base64 using uudeview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;uudeview -i yourform.xfdl
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then decommpressed it using gunzip&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;gunzip -S "" &amp;lt; UNKNOWN.001 &amp;gt; yourform-unpacked.xml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The xml produced is 100% readable and looks wonderful.  Without modifying the xml then, i should be able to re-compress it using gzip:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;gzip yourform-unpacked.xml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then re-encoded in base-64:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;base64 -e yourform-unpacked.xml.gz yourform_reencoded.xfdl
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If my thinking is correct, the original file and the re-encoded file should be equal.  If I put yourform.xfdl and yourform_reencoded.xfdl into beyond compare, however, they do not match up.  Also, the original file can be viewed in an .xfdl viewer.  The viewer says that the re-encoded xfdl is unreadable.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also tried uuenview to re-encode in base64, it also produces the same results. Any help would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day it depends whether your string formatting is going to be called repetitively, i.e. you're doing some serious text processing over 100's of megabytes of text, or whether it's being called when a user clicks a button now and again. Unless you're doing some huge batch processing job I'd stick with String.Format, it aids code readability. If you suspect a perf bottleneck then stick a profiler on your code and see where it really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important thing to keep in mind: World of Warcraft is available in many languages. If you have a EU Account, you got an excellent testing bed by simply downloading the language Packs for Spanish, German and French. If you're an US Guy, check if you can get the Latin America version. That way, you can test it against another language version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you made 1 or 2 really small and simple addons just to learn how to use it, have a look at the various frameworks. &lt;a href="http://www.wowace.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;WowAce&lt;/a&gt; is a popular one, but there are others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just keep one thing in mind: Making an Addon is work. Maintaining one is even more work. With each new Patch, there may be breaking changes, and the next Addon will surely cause a big Exodus of Addons, just like Patch 2.0.1 did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it can sure be informative to understand lower levels of the system - how they work, how your code interacts with them (even if only indirectly), and where you have additional options that aren't available in the higher-level abstractions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are times when your code might not be as efficient, high-performance or precise enough for your requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, in more and more cases, folks like us (who never learned "unmanaged coding") will be able to pull off the programming we're trying to do without "learning" Win32.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further, there's plenty of sites that provide working samples, code fragments and even fully-functional source code that you can "leverage" (borrow, plagiarize - but check that you're complying with any re-use license or copyright!) to fill in any gaps that aren't handled by the .NET framework class libraries (or the libraries that you can download or license).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can pull off the feats you need without messing around in Win32, and you're doing a good job of developing well-formed, readable managed code, then I'd say mastering .NET would be a better choice than spreading yourself thin over two very different environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you frequently need to leverage those features of Windows that haven't received good Framework class library coverage, then by all means, learn the skills you need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've personally spent far too much time worrying about the "other areas" of coding that I'm &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to understand to produce "good programs", but there's plenty of masochists out there that think everyone's needs and desires are like their own.  Misery loves company.  :)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the assumption that you're building apps for the "Web 2.0" world, or that would be just as useful/beneficial to *NIX &amp;amp; MacOS users:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stick with languages and compilers that target as many cross-platform environments as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pure .NET in Visual Studio is better than Win32 obviously, but developing against the MONO libraries, perhaps using the Sharp Develop IDE, is probably an even better approach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you could also spend your time learning Java, and those skills would transfer very well to C# programming (plus the Java code would theoretically run on any platform with the matching JRE).  I've heard it said that Java is more like "write once, debug everywhere", but that's probably as true as (or even moreso than) C#.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a piece of advice to make that decision, if your new objects are not carrying extra information about the exception then you can forget constructing new exceptions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in other circumstances, having a hierarchy of exceptions is very convenient for the user of your classes. Suppose you're implementing the Facade pattern neither of the so far considered scenarios is good:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is not good that you raise every exception as an Exception object because you're losing (probably) valuable information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is not good neither to raise every kind of object that you catch because doing so you're failing in creating the facade&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this hypothetical case, the better thing to do is to create a hierarchy of exception classes that, abstracting your users from the inner complexities of the system, allows them to know something about the kind of exception produced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Lazily constructed in a thread safe manner (two threads might simultaneously be the first user of the singleton - it should still only be constructed once).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doesn't rely on static variables being constructed beforehand (so the singleton object is itself safe to use during the construction of static variables).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I don't know my C++ well enough, but is it the case that integral and constant static variables are initialized before any code is executed (ie, even before static constructors are executed - their values may already be "initialized" in the program image)?  If so - perhaps this can be exploited to implement a singleton mutex - which can in turn be used to guard the creation of the real singleton..)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use static initialisation (as opposed to dynamic initialisation) of a POD static variable, and implementing my own mutex with that using the builtin atomic instructions.  This was the type of solution I was hinting at in my question, and I believe I knew already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use some other library function like &lt;a href="http://opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/pthread_once.html"&gt;pthread_once&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_33_1/doc/html/call_once.html"&gt;boost::call_once&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;The exception is not being lost in the first case, it is being passed in to the constructor.  I will agree with you on the rest though, the second approach is a very bad idea because of the loss of stack trace.  When I worked with .NET, I ran into many cases where other programmers did just that, and it frustrated me to no end when I needed to see the true cause of an exception, only to find it being rethrown from a huge try block where I now have no idea where the problem originated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also second Brad's comment that you shouldn't worry about the performance.  This kind of micro optimization is a HORRIBLE idea.  Unless you are talking about throwing an exception in every iteration of a for loop that is running for a long time, you will more than likely not run into performance issues by the way of your exception usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always optimize performance when you have metrics that indicate you NEED to optimize performance, and then hit the spots that are proven to be the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is much better to have readable code with easy debugging capabilities (IE not hiding the stack trace) rather than make something run a nanosecond faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final note about wrapping exceptions into a custom exception... this can be a very useful construct, especially when dealing with UIs.  You can wrap every known and reasonable exceptional case into some base custom exception (or one that extends from said base exception), and then the UI can just catch this base exception.  When caught, the exception will need to provide means of displaying information to the user, say a ReadableMessage property, or something along those lines.  Thus, any time the UI misses an exception, it is because of a bug you need to fix, and anytime it catches an exception, it is a known error condition that can and should be handled properly by the UI.&lt;/p&gt;" OwnerUserId="122" LastActivityDate="2008-08-09T21:17:35.057" CommentCount="0"/>

This means the code window takes up as much space as possible, while keeping the left hand edge of the code close to the middle of the screen, where my eyes naturally look. My main monitor is a wide screen, so I find that gives me more than enough room for my code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My secondary monitor has a second window, which contains the tool windows that I use. So I have solution explorer, error list, task list (//todo: comments), output window, find results etc. all taking up as much space as they like on my secondary monitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When debugging, the solution explorer moves the main monitor, and the watch, autos and locals windows take its place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find this gives me a very large area to write code, and really helps usage of all of those additional windows, by giving them more real estate than they'd usually have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; In response to everyone talking about using the second monitor for documentation or running the app, I wholeheartedly agree, and forgot to mention how I do that. I use &lt;a href="http://www.abstractpath.com/powermenu/"&gt;PowerMenu&lt;/a&gt; alot to acheive this. Basically I can right-click on any window and set Always On Top. So while i'm debugging, i want to see my output window, but then if I have to refer to some documentation, I just flick to Mozilla (on the second monitor), set it on top, and go back to visual studio. I find this lets me manage the tool windows without having to either shuffle them around a lot, or take up valuable space in the code window.&lt;/p&gt;" OwnerUserId="489" LastEditorUserId="489" LastEditorDisplayName="Ch00k" LastEditDate="2008-08-09T23:09:20.903" LastActivityDate="2008-08-09T23:09:20.903" CommentCount="4"/>

(It is supported by the Java 1.5 and later  and I think .NET  memory model.)  This means that between the time when the &lt;code&gt;pObj == NULL&lt;/code&gt; check takes place and when the lock (mutex) is acquired, &lt;code&gt;pObj&lt;/code&gt; may have already been assigned on another thread.  Thread switching happens whenever the OS wants it to, not between "lines" of a program (which have no meaning post-compilation in most languages).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, as Matt acknowledges, he uses an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; as a lock rather than an OS primitive.  Don't do that.  Proper locks require the use of memory barrier instructions, potentially cache-line flushes, and so on; use your operating system's primitives for locking.  This is especially important because the primitives used can change between the individual CPU lines that your operating system runs on; what works on a CPU Foo might not work on CPU Foo2.  Most operating systems either natively support POSIX threads (pthreads) or offer them as a wrapper for the OS threading package, so it's often best to illustrate examples using them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your operating system offers appropriate primitives, and if you absolutely need it for performance, instead of doing this type of locking/initialization you can use an &lt;em&gt;atomic compare and swap&lt;/em&gt; operation to initialize a shared global variable.  Essentially, what you write will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;MySingleton *MySingleton::GetSingleton() {
    if (pObj == NULL) {
        // create a temporary instance of the singleton
        MySingleton *temp = new MySingleton();
        if (OSAtomicCompareAndSwapPtrBarrier(NULL, temp, &amp;amp;pObj) == false) {
            // if the swap didn't take place, delete the temporary instance
            delete temp;
        }
    }

    return pObj;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This only works if it's safe to create multiple instances of your singleton (one per thread that happens to invoke GetSingleton() simultaneously), and then throw extras away.  The &lt;code&gt;OSAtomicCompareAndSwapPtrBarrier&lt;/code&gt; function provided on Mac OS X  most operating systems provide a similar primitive  checks whether &lt;code&gt;pObj&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; and only actually sets it to &lt;code&gt;temp&lt;/code&gt; to it if it is.  This uses hardware support to really, literally only perform the swap &lt;em&gt;once&lt;/em&gt; and tell whether it happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another facility to leverage if your OS offers it that's in between these two extremes is &lt;code&gt;pthread_once&lt;/code&gt;.  This lets you set up a function that's run only once - basically by doing all of the locking/barrier/etc. trickery for you - no matter how many times it's invoked or on how many threads it's invoked.&lt;/p&gt;

In general, no, this is not possible.  You need something available for synchronization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for your other question, yes, static variables which can be statically initialized (i.e. no runtime code necessary) are guaranteed to be initialized before other code is executed.  This makes it possible to use a statically-initialized mutex to synchronize creation of the singleton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the 2003 revision of the C++ standard:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Objects with static storage duration (3.7.1) shall be zero-initialized (8.5) before any other initialization takes place. Zero-initialization and initialization with a constant expression are collectively called static initialization; all other initialization is dynamic initialization. Objects of POD types (3.9) with static storage duration initialized with constant expressions (5.19) shall be initialized before any dynamic initialization takes place. Objects with static storage duration defined in namespace scope in the same translation unit and dynamically initialized shall be initialized in the order in which their definition appears in the translation unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that you will be using this singleton during the initialization of other static objects, I think you'll find that synchronization is a non-issue.  To the best of my knowledge, all major compilers initialize static objects in a single thread, so thread-safety during static initialization.  You can declare your singleton pointer to be NULL, and then check to see if it's been initialized before you use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this assumes that you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that you'll use this singleton during static initialization.  This is also not guaranteed by the standard, so if you want to be completely safe, use a statically-initialized mutex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Chris's suggestion to use an atomic compare-and-swap would certainly work.  If portability is not an issue (and creating additional temporary singletons is not a problem), then it is a slightly lower overhead solution.&lt;/p&gt;" OwnerUserId="872" OwnerDisplayName="Derek" LastEditorUserId="872" LastEditorDisplayName="Derek" LastEditDate="2008-08-10T00:06:19.117" LastActivityDate="2008-08-10T00:06:19.117" CommentCount="0"/>

&lt;p&gt;I personally use custom exceptions if I want to decouple certain dependencies in code. For example, I have a method that loads data from an XML file. This can go wrong in many different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could fail to read from the disk (FileIOException), the user could try to access it from somewhere where they are not allowed (SecurityException), the file could be corrupt (XmlParseException), data could be in the wrong format (DeserialisationException).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, so its easier for the calling class to make sense of all this, all these exceptions rethrow a single custom exception (FileOperationException) so that means the caller does not need references to System.IO or System.Xml, but can still access what error occurred through an enum and any important information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated, don't try to micro-optimize something like this, the act of throwing an exception at all is the slowest thing that occurs here. The best improvement to make is to try avoiding an exception at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public bool Load(string filepath)
{
  if (File.Exists(filepath)) //Avoid throwing by checking state
  {
    //Wrap anyways in case something changes between check and operation

    catch (OtherException otherFault) { .... }
    return true; //Inform caller of success

  else { return false; } //Inform caller of failure due to state
}

I would say that unless your application is a quick an dirty one-off, you will gain immense flexibility and end up with a better design if you choose WCF.

I didn't do the math, but I think during a leap year, with a hard code of 28 days for feb, a comparison of noon on 2/29 and noon on 3/1 would result in the same duplicate time stamp as before.  Although it looks like you didn't implement it like that.  They way you implemented it, I think you still have the problem but it's between dates on 12/31 of $leapyear and 1/1 of $leapyear+1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you might also have some collisions during time changes if your code has to handle time zones that handle them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file doesn't really seem to be sorted in any useful way.  I'm guessing that field $1 is some sort of status (the "OK" you're checking for).  So it's sorted by record status, then by DAY, then MONTH, YEAR, HOURS, MINUTES, SECONDS.  If it was year,month,day I think there could be some optimizations there.  Still might be but my brain's going in a different direction right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are a small number of duplicate keys in proportion to total number of lines, I think your best bet is to reduce the file your awk script works over to just duplicate keys (as &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6475/faster-way-to-find-duplicates-conditioned-by-time#6813" rel="nofollow"&gt;David said&lt;/a&gt;).  You could also preprocess the file so the only lines present are the /OK/ lines.  I think I would do this with a pipeline where the first awk script only prints the lines with duplicate IDs and the second awk script is basically the one above but optimized to not look for /OK/ and with the knowledge that any key present is a duplicate key.&lt;/p&gt;

You'd need to do some testing to find the optimal barriers). Make it so that any of the threads can potentially be the "reader thread" as it has to lock the queue to pull an item out anyway it can also check to see if the "low buffer region" has been hit and start reading again.

&lt;p&gt;Next make an attempt to write your own HLSL which does what the &lt;a href="http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/t/tandl.htm"&gt;Fixed T&amp;amp;L&lt;/a&gt; pipeline used to do, just to get you hands dirty. This is the equivalent of a "hello world" program in vertex/pixel shader world. When you're able to do that and you understand what you've written you're ready to go onto the more fun stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a next step you might want to simulate basic &lt;a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20030418/engel_pfv.htm"&gt;sepcular lighting&lt;/a&gt; in one of your shaders from a single light source. You can then adapt this down the track to use multiple lights. Play with colours, and movement of lights. This will help get familiar with the use of shader constants as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have a couple of basic shaders together, you should attempt to make it so that your game/engine uses multiple/different shaders on different objects. Start adding some other bits like basic &lt;a href="http://www.paulsprojects.net/tutorials/simplebump/simplebump.html"&gt;bump&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.bencloward.com/tutorials_normal_maps1.shtml"&gt;normal maps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you get to this stage, the world is your oyster. You can start diving into some funky effectcs, and even consider using the GPU for &lt;a href="http://www.gpgpu.org/"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; than it was originally intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who are a little more advanced, there are a couple of good books that are available for free online which have some great information from Nvidia &lt;a href="http://developer.nvidia.com/object/gpu_gems_home.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://developer.nvidia.com/object/gpu_gems_2_home.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't forget that there's an excellent series of books called ShaderX which covers some awesome shader stuff. There's &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1556220413"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1556229887"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1584503572"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1584504250"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1584504994"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1584505443"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; already in print, and &lt;a href="http://www.shaderx7.com/"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt; is coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If you want lazy-instantiation of the singleton while using a pointer to a dynamically allocated instance, you'll have to make sure you clean it up at the right point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You could use Matt's solution, but you'd need to use a proper mutex/critical section for locking, and by checking "pObj == NULL" both before and after the lock. Of course, &lt;strong&gt;pObj&lt;/strong&gt; would also have to be &lt;em&gt;static&lt;/em&gt; ;)

A mutex would be unnecessarily heavy in this case, you'd be better going with a critical section.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OJ, that doesn't work.  As Chris pointed out, that's double-check locking, which is not guaranteed to work in the current C++ standard.  See: &lt;a href="http://www.ddj.com/184405726" rel="nofollow"&gt;C++ and the Perils of Double-Checked Locking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Why build a complex program with inter-thread communication if it's not necessary?  Spawn 4 threads.  Each thread calculates size-of-file/4 to determine it's start point (and stop point).  Each thread can then work entirely independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; reason to add a special thread to handle reading is if you expect some lines to take a very long time to process &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; you expect that these lines are clustered in a single part of the file.  Adding inter-thread communication when you don't need it is a &lt;em&gt;very bad idea&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;This is a good technique as it drives home the size of the type to the programmer and makes you more conscious of chances for overflow etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But on some systems you know that the compiler and processor won't change for the life of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what should influence your decision to create and enforce project-specific types?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT
I think I managed to lose the gist of my question, and maybe it's really two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With embedded programming you may need types of specific size for interfaces and also to cope with restricted resources such as RAM.  This can't be avoided, but you can choose to use the basic types from the compiler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For everything else the types have less importance.&lt;br /&gt;
You need to be careful not to cause overflow and may need to watch out for register and stack usage.  Which may lead you to UINT16, UCHAR.
Using types such as UCHAR can add compiler 'fluff' however.  Because registers are typically larger, some compilers may add code to force the result into the type.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;PRE&gt;    i++;&lt;/PRE&gt;
can become
&lt;PRE&gt;    ADD REG,1
    AND REG, 0xFF&lt;/PRE&gt;
which is unecessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I think my question should have been :-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;given the constraints of embedded software what is the best policy to set for a project which will have many people working on it - not all of whom will be of the same level of experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must confess I have a serious soft spot for Niklaus Wirth's &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0201403536"&gt;Compiler Construction.&lt;/a&gt; It is &lt;a href="http://www-old.oberon.ethz.ch/WirthPubl/CBEAll.pdf"&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt; as a PDF. I find Wirth's programming aesthetic simply beautiful, however some people find his style too minimal (for example Wirth favors recursive descent parsers, but most CS courses focus on parser generator tools; Wirth's language designs are fairly conservative.) Compiler Construction is a very succinct distillation of Wirth's basic ideas, so whether you like his style or not or not, I highly recommend reading this book.&lt;/p&gt;

In the book, he talks about how to handle mutable objects that callers pass to your code (e.g., in setters), and mutable objects that you pass to callers (e.g., in getters).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For setters, make sure to clone any mutable objects, and store the clone. This way, callers cannot change the passed-in object after the fact to break your program's invariants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For getters, either return an immutable view of your internal data, if the interface allows it; or else return a clone of the internal data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When calling user-supplied callbacks with internal data, send in an immutable view or clone, as appropriate, unless you intend the callback to alter the data, in which case you have to validate it after the fact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The take-home message is to make sure no outside code can hold an alias to any mutable objects that you use internally, so that you can maintain your invariants.&lt;/p&gt;

If you just need all of the work started in the loop to finish before the code continues, but you don't care about the order the work within the loop finishes, then calling Join is the answer. To add more detail to &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6890/compact-framework-how-to-wait-for-thread-complete-before-continuing#6935" rel="nofollow" title="Modern Compiler Implementation in ML"&gt;Kevin Kenny's answer,&lt;/a&gt; you should call Join &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the loop. This means you will need a collection to hold references to the threads you started:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Start all of the threads.
List&amp;lt;Thread&amp;gt; startedThreads = new List&amp;lt;Thread&amp;gt;();
foreach (...) {
  Thread thread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(MyMethod));
  thread.Start();
  startedThreads.Add(thread);
}

// Wait for all of the threads to finish.
foreach (Thread thread in startedThreads) {
  thread.Join();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, if you called Join inside the loop, the result would basically be the same as not using threads at all. Each iteration of the loop body would create and start a thread but then immediately Join it and wait for it to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the individual threads produce some result (write a message in a log, for example) then the messages may still appear out of order because there's no coordination between the threads. It is possible to get the threads to output their results in order by coordinating them with a Monitor.&lt;/p&gt;

If you can use a compiler that supports C99 (gcc does), you'll find these in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;stdint.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and you can just use them in your projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it can be especially important in embedded projects to use types as a sort of "safety net" for things like unit conversions.  If you can use C++, I understand that there are some "unit" libraries out there that let you work in physical units that are defined by the C++ type system (via templates) that are compiled as operations on the underlying scalar types.  For example, these libraries won't let you add a &lt;code&gt;distance_t&lt;/code&gt; to a &lt;code&gt;mass_t&lt;/code&gt; because the units don't line up; you'll actually get a compiler error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you can't work in C++ or another language that lets you write code that way, you can at least use the C type system to help you catch errors like that by eye.  (That was actually the original intent of Simonyi's Hungarian notation.)  Just because the compiler won't yell at you for adding a &lt;code&gt;meter_t&lt;/code&gt; to a &lt;code&gt;gram_t&lt;/code&gt; doesn't mean you shouldn't use types like that.  Code reviews will be much more productive at discovering unit errors then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking like this. It is up to the caller to supply correct parameters otherwise ALL functions and methods have to check every incomming parameter. But if the check is only done for the caller the check is only needed once. So, a parameter should be "correct" and thus can be passed through to lower levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always check data from external sources, users etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A "component" or framework should always check incomming calls.&lt;/li&gt;

One only have an indication that the "data" the program is working on is wrong and some like ASSERTS but others want to use advanced error reporting and possible error recovery. In any case the data is found to be faulty and in few cases it's good to continue working on it. (note it's good if servers don't die at least)&lt;/p&gt;

Unlike Rails' url_for :anchor, UrlHelper.GenerateUrl (and ActionLink, RedirectToAction and so on which use it) don't have a magic property name that lets you encode an anchor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you point out, you could roll your own that does. This is probably the cleanest solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hackily, you could just include an anchor in a route and specify the value in your parameters hash:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;routes.MapRoute("WithTarget", "{controller}/{action}/{id}#{target}");
...
&amp;lt;%= Html.ActionLink("Home", "Index", new { target = "foo" })%&amp;gt;

Things like avoiding deprecated functions, which (in the Microsoft C++ libraries at least) are commonly deprecated because of security vulnerabilities, and validating everything that crosses an external boundary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functions that are only called from your code should not require excessive parameter validation because you control the caller, that is, no external boundary is crossed. Functions called by other people's code should assume that the incoming parameters will be invalid and/or malicious at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My approach to dealing with exposed functions is to simply crash out, with a helpful message if possible. If the caller can't get the parameters right then the problem is in their code and they should fix it, not you. (Obviously you have provided documentation for your function, since it is exposed.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code injection is only an issue if your application is able to elevate the current user. If a process can inject code into your application then it could easily write the code to memory and execute it anyway. Without being able to gain full access to the system code injection attacks are pointless. (This is why applications used by administrators should not be writeable by lesser users.)&lt;/p&gt;

One big problem I had was the problems I encountered when I had to step through it in the debugger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's an article on how to debug a SharePoint workflow &lt;a href="http://www.andrewconnell.com/blog/archive/2008/06/11/SharePoint-Debugging-and-Logging-Tips-and-Tricks.aspx" rel="nofollow" title="BenQ X-Touch"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; that tells you how to set breakpoints etc. This involves copying the .pdb file into the GAC alongside the .dll file containing your workflow. You have to do this from a command prompt (or a batch file) because Windows Explorer doesn't let you view the relevant subdirectory of c:\windows\assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you do this, the next time you try to deploy the workflow from within Visual Studio, it complains that it can't be deployed because "the file may not be signed" and if you attempt to copy the new version of the dll into the GAC, it tells you that the .dll file is locked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've found that some of the time, you can get round this by doing an iisreset, but on other occasions you have to restart Visual Studio and there have been frequent times when I've even had to reboot the computer altogether because some mystery process has locked the file. When I don't use the debugger, on the other hand, everything works just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've used them all and I found that web.py was the one that I enjoyed using the most.  It does less for you but also gets out your way pretty effectively so you can just do what you need to and no more.  It's probably the one that meets your accessibility/no boilerplate requirement the best.  This comes at the cost of being (by far) the least mature.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turbogears and Django were a much of a muchness (maybe TurboGears just shaded it).  The thing to remember with TurboGears though is that it is mostly a lot of glue to bind together lots of other projects into a framework. When things go wrong, it can often be in a non-TG library and  (slightly) harder to figure out what's gone wrong where, and how to get help.  Django is a little more cohesive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the caveat though, I've never deployed anything of any significance with them.  Everything I have written has been a prototype or a lightly used internal system.  Very soon we'll be starting a much larger, external project and I think that we will have to make a call based on which we think will be the most stable and easy to keep &lt;a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2007/05/10/performant-isn-t-a-word.aspx"&gt;performant&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.turbogears.org/"&gt;TurboGears&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://pylonshq.com/"&gt;Pylons&lt;/a&gt; mostly have the feel of Lego blocks, where different apps can be used in different websites very easily, all using the prescribed tools for the database, network, etc.  If you like any of the apps currently in development (say, &lt;a href="http://byteflow.su/"&gt;Byteflow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://sct.sphene.net/"&gt;Sphene Community Tools&lt;/a&gt;, or Flatpages for Django), then there's not really much work to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the three, Django was the first I tried, and I went insane looking for the most trivial of things, like code for the URL of the page that was being rendered.  Django is well polished and it has good documentation, but it doesn't like letting you reach down to a lower level of abstraction.  It's also accused of being monolithic and having an NIH attitude, although it's becoming more and more modular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TurboGears is written over CherryPy, Pylons is written over Paste, and TurboGears 2 is being written over Pylons.  Pylons and TurboGears have very similar philosophies: for the most part, they claim to use "best-of-breed" libraries.  However, they were initially developed at different times, and the state of Python libraries changed considerably in between.  Thus, both frameworks essentially provide glue around solid libraries, but they use different toolsets at for pretty much everything.  A brief overview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TurboGears - CherryPy for HTTP, Genshi (XML-based) for templating, SqlObject (simpler) for persistence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pylons - Paste for HTTP, Mako (faster) for templating, SqlAlchemy (more powerful) for persistence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paste and Pylons are architected entirely around WSGI.  WSGI (links: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web%5FServer%5FGateway%5FInterface"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/"&gt;PEP 333&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://wsgi.org/wsgi/Learn%5FWSGI"&gt;WSGI wiki&lt;/a&gt; is a low-level interface, essentially a powerful superset of CGI and its brethren.  While most people acknowledge its usefulness to framework developers, there's a lot of controversy over its usefulness to webapp developers, which I won't link to here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the two, Pylons is probably the better choice because it offers more modern components.  The TurboGears community was divided a while ago; I'm not sure how they're doing right now, but it'll still be chaotic until the transition to TurboGears 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTTP frameworks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cherrypy.org/"&gt;CherryPy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pythonpaste.org/"&gt;Paste&lt;/a&gt;, and maybe &lt;a href="http://webpy.org/"&gt;web.py&lt;/a&gt; do lots of networking for you but little else.  If you want to use &lt;a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/"&gt;Jinja2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://genshi.edgewall.org/"&gt;Genshi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.makotemplates.org/"&gt;Mako&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;, or any other templating engine, you'll have to integrate it yourself.  And if you want to use &lt;a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/"&gt;SqlAlchemy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://storm.canonical.com/"&gt;Storm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sqlobject.org/"&gt;SqlObject&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://www.aminus.net/dejavu"&gt;Dejavu&lt;/a&gt; for databases, you'll have to integrate them yourself.  The benefit is that the low-level data is right in front of you.  For example, in CherryPy, getting the base of the URL, the list of cookies, and the list of headers is as simple as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cherrypy.request.base
cherrypy.request.cookie
cherrypy.request.headers
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;because CherryPy is so pythonic.  The &lt;code&gt;request&lt;/code&gt; is just an object that has all those attributes.  Similarly, &lt;code&gt;response&lt;/code&gt; is an object so you can set the client's cookies with statements like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cherrypy.response.cookie['cookieName'] = 'cookieValue'
cherrypy.response.cookie['cookieName']['expires'] = 3600
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paste (which I haven't used outside of Pylons) is slower and less pythonic, but it uses WSGI exclusively and is currently gaining momentum.  The WSGI wars have simmered since CherryPy 3 was released in late 2006, adding better WSGI support; but the two design philosophies are still polar opposites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other frameworks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's also Zope, the heavy-duty grandfather of Python frameworks, and Plone, a content management system that runs on top of it.  I haven't used either one, but Zope is generally compared to Java web frameworks  good if you're looking for a reliable platform, but not so good for rapid development.  Zope 3 has tremendously reduced the learning curve, but most Pythoneers have probably moved on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's also Twisted, a lower-level framework and server setup, and Nevow, another layer over Twisted.  I don't know enough about them to say much more, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There really are a lot of great choices out there; for the vast majority of users, Django, Pylons, and CherryPy offer the best coverage, and I find myself going back and forth between them for each project.  My personal preference is a custom setup with CherryPy, simply because I don't like the hierarchy and opaqueness that full-stack frameworks try to enforce.  For you, &lt;strong&gt;CherryPy&lt;/strong&gt; sounds like a good bet, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I have a structure which keeps track of a set of windows placed on the screen. I also have a grid which keeps track of all the areas between each edge, whether they are empty or filled, and the pixel position of their left or top edge. I think there is some modified form which would take advantage of this property. Do you know of any?&lt;/p&gt;

It's a XAML-like language (or OpenLaszlo-like, if you prefer) for XNA. So the buttons can be resized by the editor. The buttons might also be resized by a style sheet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess you're right that it's likely that the buttons will all be the same size in a real design. But even in a window's app, you sometimes need to make a button wider to accomodate text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;object o;

//checking with is
o is int

//check type
o.GetType() != typeof( int )

//cast and catch exception
try{ int j = (int) o; } 
catch {}

//use the tryparse
int.TryParse( Convert.ToString( o ), out j )
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can easily set up a console app that tries each of these 10,000 times and returns durations for each (test when o is an int and when it's something else).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;try-catch&lt;/code&gt; method is the quickest if the object does hold an int, and by far the slowest if it doesn't (even slower than &lt;code&gt;GetType&lt;/code&gt;).  &lt;code&gt;int.TryParse&lt;/code&gt; is pretty quick if you have a string, but if you have an unknown object it's slower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, with .Net 3.5 and optimisations turned on the &lt;code&gt;o is int&lt;/code&gt; check takes the same time as &lt;code&gt;try-catch&lt;/code&gt; when o actually is an int. &lt;code&gt;o is int&lt;/code&gt; is only slightly slower if o actually is something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annoyingly FxCop will throw up warnings if you do something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if( o is int )
    int j = (int) o;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I think that's a bug in FxCop - it doesn't know int is a value type and recommends you to use &lt;code&gt;o as int&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your input is always a string &lt;code&gt;int.TryParse&lt;/code&gt; is best, otherwise the &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; operator is quickest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you have a string I'd look at whether you need to know that it's an int, rather than a double.  If &lt;code&gt;int.TryParse&lt;/code&gt; passes then so will &lt;code&gt;double.TryParse&lt;/code&gt; so you could half the number of checks - return either double or string and floor the doubles when you expect an int.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In C# the conversion from decimal to double is explicit as you lose accuracy. For instance 1.1 can't be accurately expressed as a double, but can as a decimal (see "&lt;a href="http://bizvprog.blogspot.com/2008/05/floating-point-numbers-more-inaccurate.html"&gt;Floating point numbers - more inaccurate than you think&lt;/a&gt;" for the reason why).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In VB the conversion was added for you by the compiler:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;decimal trans = trackBar1.Value / 5000m;
this.Opacity = (double) trans;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Now, this doesn't necessarily mean firing him... it may mean finding someplace else in the company his skills are more suited.  But if there is no place else...you know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm assuming he is also a fairly new hire (&amp;lt; 1 year) and probably recently out of school...in which case he may not be accustomed to how things work in a corporate setting.  Things like that most of us could get away with in college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is the case, one thing I've found works is to have a sort of "surprise new hire review."  It doesn't matter if you've never done it before...he won't know that.  Just sit him down and tell him your are going to go over his performance and show him some real numbers...take your normal review sheet (you do have a formal review process right?) and change the heading if you want so it looks official and show him where he stands.  If you show him in a very formal setting that not doing tests is adversely affecting his performance rating as opposed to just "nagging" him about it, he will hopefully get the point.  You've got to show him that his actions will actually affect him be it pay wise or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, you may want to stay away from doing this because it's not official... but I think you are within reason to do it and it's probably going to be a whole lot cheaper than having to fire him and recruit someone new.&lt;/p&gt;

If you've heard things like "yeah, I know I should test this but I really need to get this done quickly" then you know what I mean. However, on an emotional level they feel that they get something done only when they're writing the real code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal, then, should be to somehow get them to understand that testing is in fact the &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; way to measure when something is "done", and thus give them the intrinsic motivation to write tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm afraid that's a lot harder than it should be, though. You'll hear a lot of excuses along the lines of "I'm in a real hurry, I'll rewrite/refactor this later and then add the tests" -- and of course, the followup never happens because, surprisingly, they're &lt;em&gt;just as busy the next week&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Having students point to each other and using pieces of paper with house addresses are both great learning tools.  They do a great job of introducing the basic concepts.  Indeed, learning the basic concepts is &lt;em&gt;vital&lt;/em&gt; to successfully using pointers.  However, in production code, it's common to get into much more complex scenarios than these simple demonstrations can encapsulate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been involved with systems where we had structures pointing to other structures pointing to other structures.  Some of those structures also contained embedded structures (rather than pointers to additional structures).  This is where pointers get really confusing.  If you've got multiple levels of indirection, and you start ending up with code like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;widget-&amp;gt;wazzle.fizzle = fazzle.foozle-&amp;gt;wazzle;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it can get confusing really quickly (imagine a lot more lines, and potentially more levels).  Throw in arrays of pointers, and node to node pointers (trees, linked lists) and it gets worse still.  I've seen some really good developers get lost once they started working on such systems, even developers who understood the basics really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complex structures of pointers don't necessarily indicate poor coding, either (though they can).  Composition is a vital piece of good object-oriented programming, and in languages with raw pointers, it will inevitably lead to multi-layered indirection.  Further, systems often need to use third-party libraries with structures which don't match each other in style or technique.  In situations like that, complexity is naturally going to arise (though certainly, we should fight it as much as possible).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the best thing colleges can do to help students learn pointers is to to use good demonstrations, combined with projects that require pointer use.  One difficult project will do more for pointer understanding than a thousand demonstrations.  Demonstrations can get you a shallow understanding, but to deeply grasp pointers, you have to really use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes one of the best ways to help junior level programmers 'get it' and learn the right techniques from the seniors is to do a bit of pair programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try this: on an upcoming project, pair the junior guy up with yourself or another senior programmer.  They should work together, taking turns "driving" (being the one typing at they keyboard) and "coaching" (looking over the shoulder of the driver and pointing out suggestions, mistakes, etc as they go).  It may seem like a waste of resources, but you will find:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That these guys together can produce code plenty fast and of higher quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your junior guy learns enough to "get it" with a senior guy directing him along the right path (eg. "Ok, now before we continue, lets write at test for this function.")  It will be well worth the resources you commit to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe also have someone in your group give the &lt;a href="http://www.masukomi.org/talks/unit_testing_talk_2/index.xul?data=slide_data.txt#page1"&gt;Unit Testing 101&lt;/a&gt; presentation by Kate Rhodes, I think its a great way to get people excited about testing, if delivered well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing you can do is have your Jr. Devs practice the &lt;a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata"&gt;Bowling Game Kata&lt;/a&gt; which will help them learn Test Driven Development.  It is in java, but could easily be adapted to any language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Offer to answer questions about testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do code reviews of tests for a while. Ask your colleague to review changes of yours that are exemplary of good testing. Look at their comments to see if they're really reading and understanding your test code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there are books that fit particularly well with your team's testing philosophy give him or her a copy. It might help if your code review feedback or discussions reference the book so he or she has a thread to pick up and follow.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you really need to "get tough" then institute an impartial system; nobody likes to feel like they're being singled out. For example your team might require code to maintain a certain level of test coverage (able to be gamed, but at least able to be automated); require new code to have tests; require reviewers to consider the quality of tests when doing code reviews; and so on. Instituting that system should come from team consensus. If you moderate the discussion carefully you might uncover other underlying reasons your colleague's testing isn't what you expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Sebastjan said, &lt;strong&gt;*&lt;em&gt;you first have to sort your data.  This is important.&lt;/em&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The part I didn't get is that in the example construction&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;groups = []
uniquekeys = []
for k, g in groupby(data, keyfunc):
   groups.append(list(g))    # Store group iterator as a list
   uniquekeys.append(k)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"k" is the current grouping key, and "g" is an iterator that you can use to iterate over the group defined by that grouping key.  In other words, the groupby iterator itself returns iterators.  Here's an example of that, using clearer variable names:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;from itertools import groupby

things = [("animal", "bear"), ("animal", "duck"), ("plant", "cactus"), ("vehicle", "speed boat"), ("vehicle", "school bus")]

for key, group in groupby(things, lambda x: x[0]):
    for thing in group:
        print "A %s is a %s." % (thing[1], key)
    print " "
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will give you the output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A bear is a animal.&lt;br&gt;
  A duck is a animal.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;A cactus is a plant.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;A speed boat is a vehicle. &lt;br&gt;
  A school bus is a vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, "things" is a list of tuples where the first item in each tuple is the group the second item belongs to.  The groupby() function takes two arguments: (1) the data to group and (2) the function to group it with.  Here, "lambda x: x[0]" tells groupby() to use the first item in each tuple as the grouping key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above "for" statement, groupby returns three (key, group iterator) pairs - once for each unique key.  You can use the returned iterator to iterate over each individual item in that group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a slightly different example with the same data, using a list comprehension:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for key, group in groupby(things, lambda x: x[0]):
    listOfThings = " and ".join(["%s" % thing[1] for thing in group])
    print key + "s:  " + listOfThings + "."
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will give you the output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;animals: bear and duck.&lt;br&gt;
  plants: cactus.&lt;br&gt;
  vehicles: speed boat and school bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python's pretty cool, no?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Turing completeness, named after Alan
  Turing, is significant in that every
  plausible design for a computing
  device so far advanced can be emulated
  by a universal Turing machine  an
  observation that has become known as
  the Church-Turing thesis. Thus, a
  machine that can act as a universal
  Turing machine can, in principle,
  perform any calculation that any other
  programmable computer is capable of.
  However, this has nothing to do with
  the effort required to write a program
  for the machine, the time it may take
  for the machine to perform the
  calculation, or any abilities the
  machine may possess that are unrelated
  to computation.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;While truly Turing-complete machines
  are very likely physically impossible,
  as they require unlimited storage,
  Turing completeness is often loosely
  attributed to physical machines or
  programming languages that would be
  universal if they had unlimited
  storage. All modern computers are
  Turing-complete in this sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know how you can be more non-technical than that except by saying "turing complete means 'able to answer computable problem given enough time and space'".&lt;/p&gt;

While most XML processors will preserve any whitespace you put in your XML, it's not guaranteed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real problem is that most applications that output your XML into a readable format consider all whitespace in an XML interchangable, and might collapse those linebreaks into a single space.  That's why your XSLT has to jump through such hoops to render the data properly.  Using a "br" tag would vastly simplify the transform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another potential problem is that if you open up your XML document in an XML editor and pretty-print it, you're likely to lose those line breaks.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do keep using linebreaks, make sure add an xml:space="preserve" attribute to "address."  (You can do this in your DTD, if you're using one.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;XML applications often seem to take a
  cavalier attitude toward whitespace
  because the rules about the places in
  an XML document where whitespace

  remove whitespace in certain places.&lt;/p&gt;

Secondly, I found a great way to avoid making tons of changes in old code is to just refactor it a little until you can test it.  One easy way to do this is to make private members protected, and then override the protected field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, let's say you have a class that loads some stuff from the database during the constructor.  In this case, you can't just override a protected method, but you can extract the DB logic to a protected field and then override it in the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class MyClass {
    public MyClass() {
        // undesirable DB logic
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;becomes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class MyClass {
    public MyClass() {
        loadFromDB();
    }

    protected void loadFromDB() {
        // undesirable DB logic
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then your test looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class MyClassTest {
    public void testSomething() {
        MyClass myClass = new MyClassWrapper();
        // test it
    }

    private static class MyClassWrapper extends MyClass {
        @Override
        protected void loadFromDB() {
            // some mock logic
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is somewhat of a bad example, because you could use DBUnit in this case, but I actually did this in a similar case recently because I wanted to test some functionality totally unrelated to the data being loaded, so it was very effective.  I've also found such exposing of members to be useful in other similar cases where I need to get rid of some dependency that has been in a class for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would recommend against this solution if you are writing a framework though, unless you really don't mind exposing the members to users of your framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a bit of a hack, but I've found it quite useful.&lt;/p&gt;

You can either dump this into a file or pipe it straight into the database frontend.&lt;/p&gt;

Then you will immediately see if changes in one piece break the tests in other subsystem.

Apparently, the visualization of the data is important to you, important enough to keep it in your data (via line breaks in your first example). Fine. Then really keep it, don't rely on "magic" to keep it for you. Keep every bit of data you'll need later on and can't deduce perfectly from the saved portion of the data, keep it even if it's visualization data (line breaks and other formatting). Your user (end user of another developer) took the time to format that data to his liking - either tell him (API doc / text near the input) that you don't intend on keeping it, or - just keep it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the base class property &lt;code&gt;DropDownItems&lt;/code&gt; has a 'default' attribute set on it that is a different value (not 50).  As a result, when I drag the control onto a form, the designer file gets an explicit &lt;code&gt;mycontrol.DropDownItems = 50;&lt;/code&gt; line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first this doesn't matter.  But if later I change my inherited class to &lt;code&gt;DropDownItems = 45;&lt;/code&gt; in the constructor this does not affect any of the controls on any form since all those designer files still have the value 50 hard-coded in them.  And the whole point was to have the value set in one place so I can deal with the customer changing his mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, if I were creating my own custom property in the subclass, I could give it its own designer default attribute of whatever I wanted.  But here I'm wanting to change the default values of properties in the base.  Is there any way to apply Visual Studio attributes to a base class member?  Or is there some other workaround to get the result I want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I disagree with your statement that tests shouldn't break the build.  The tests should be an indication that the application doesn't have new bugs introduced for the functionality that is tested (and a found bug is an indication of a missing test).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If tests don't break the build, then you can easily run into the situation where new code breaks the build and it isn't known for a while, even though a test covered it.  A failing test should be a red flag that either the test or the code has to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, allowing the tests to not break the build will cause the failure rate to slowly creep up, to the point where you no longer have a reliable set of regression tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is a problem with tests breaking too often, it may be an indication that the tests are being written in too fragile a manner (dependence on resources that could change, such as the database without using DB Unit properly, or an external web service that should be mocked), or it may be an indication that there are developers in the team that don't give the tests proper attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I firmly believe that a failing test should be fixed ASAP, just as you would fix code that fails to compile ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;@Derek &amp;amp; Mark: I wish there was a way to accept 2 answers. I'm going to have to end up going with Wolfbyte's solution because if I split the file into n sections there is the potential for a thread to come across a batch of "slow" transactions, however if I was processing a file where each process was guaranteed to require an equal amount of processing then I really like your solution of just splitting the file into chunks and assigning each chunk to a thread and being done with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No worries.  If clustered "slow" transactions is a issue, then the queuing solution is the way to go.  Depending on how fast or slow the average transaction is, you might also want to look at assigning multiple lines at a time to each worker.  This will cut down on synchronization overhead.  Likewise, you might need to optimize your buffer size.  Of course, both of these are optimizations that you should probably only do after profiling.  (No point in worrying about synchronization if it's not a bottleneck.)&lt;/p&gt;

Everyone else is encouraged to read the commits too, as it's a great way of seeing what's going on, but the junior devs don't comment so much. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I think it would look much nicer, if the textarea I'm using for the main address details would just take up the area of the text in it, and automatically resize if the text was changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a screenshot of it currently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Chris&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good point, but there are reasons I want it to resize, I want the area it takes up to be the area of the information contained in it.  As you can see in the screen shot, if I have a fixed textarea, it takes up a fair wack of vertical space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can reduce the font, but I need address to be large and readable.  Now I can reduce the size of the text area, but then I have problems with people who have an address line that takes 3 or 4 (one takes 5) lines.  Needing to have the user use a scrollbar is a major no-no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I should be a bit more specific, I'm after vertical resizing, the width doesn't matter as much.  The only problem that happens with that, is the ISO number (the large "1") gets pushed under the address when the window width is too small (as you can see on the screenshot).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not about having a gimick, it's about having a text field the user can edit that won't take up unnecessary space, but will show all the text in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though if someone comes up with another way to approach the problem I'm open to that too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say what, you sprung something that I am completely unprepared for. I feel uncomfortable with this, but will do my best. I will now be scared and mildly apprehensive of this coming up again, thank you. However, the scare tactic might have worked, but it does have a cost.

This is one of my handicaps now, but it won't be for long. However, if I just don't get it, I understand that I will go. I think I will get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, the support of my team with play a large part in all this. Having a person take their time to assist, and get me started into good habits is always welcome. Then, afterward having a good support net would be great. It would always be appreciated to have someone come a few times afterward, and go over some code, to see how everything is flowing, not in a review per se, but more as a friendly visit.&lt;/p&gt;

Parsing the messages to get the failures is harder, and reliably parsing out which email caused the failure and why it failed is really hard.  The problem is that bounce messages don't have a standard format, the default forms vary from MTA to MTA.  Then the failure reason can be tweaked by the site admin making it harder to recognize, and the site admin could modify the failure message template which makes it darn near impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See if you can find a .NET mailing list manager and if you can repurpose the bounce handling code.  Failing that, see if you can change the tool that's sending the messages to send each email from a unique (and reversible) enveloper sender (VERP I think it's called?).  That way you don't need to scan the body of the email, you can tell which recipient failed by examining the recipient address of the failure message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use SSL when authenticating users or performing sensitive operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regenerate the session id whenever the security level changes (such as logging in). You can even regenerate the session id every request if you wish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have sessions time out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't use register globals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Store authentication details on the server. That is, don't send details such as username in the cookie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the &lt;code&gt;$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']&lt;/code&gt;. This adds a small barrier to session hijacking. You can also check the IP address. But this causes problems for users that have changing IP address due to load balancing on multiple internet connections etc (which is the case in our environment here).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lock down access to the sessions on the file system or use custom session handling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For sensitive operations consider requiring logged in users to provide their authenication details again&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did some neat stuff with it... we were a web based telecom application, so one cool use I set up was to mimick dialing a number through our web application, then used an auto answer tool we had (which was basically a tutorial app from Microsoft to connect to their RTC LCS server... which is what Microsoft Office Communicator connects to on a local network... then modified to just pick up calls automatically).  This then allowed us to use this instead of an expensive telephony tool called The Hammer (or something like that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, we also used the tool to see how our application held up under high load, and it was very effective in finding bottlenecks.  The tool has built in reporting to show how long requests are taking, but we never used it.  The logs can also store all the responses and whatnot, or custom logging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend this tool, very useful for the price... but expect to do some custom setup with it (it has a built in proxy to record a script, but it may need customization for capturing something like sessions...

&lt;p&gt;Which gets me all the running processes which match that criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don't know how to get the first one. The examples I can find on the net seem to imply I have to do this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var matchedApp = (from app in Process.GetProcesses()
    where app.ProcessName.Contains( "MyAppName" ) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; app.MainWindowHandle != IntPtr.Zero
    select app).First();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which strikes me as somewhat ugly, and also throws an exception if there are no matching processes. Is there a better way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm actually trying to find the first matching item, and call &lt;code&gt;SetForegroundWindow&lt;/code&gt; on it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've come up with this solution, which also strikes me as ugly and awful, but better than above. Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var unused = from app in Process.GetProcesses()
    where app.ProcessName.Contains( "MyAppName" ) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; app.MainWindowHandle != IntPtr.Zero
    select SetForegroundWindow( app.MainWindowHandle ); // side-effects in linq-query is technically bad I guess
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

However, I think I have somehow managed to corrupt my heap. This is based off the fact that I added a &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt; to a class and assigning it a value from another &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;std::string hello = "Hello, world.\n";
/* exampleString = "Hello, world.\n" would work fine. */
exampleString = hello;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;crashes on my system with a stack dump. So basically I need to &lt;strong&gt;stop&lt;/strong&gt; and go through all my code and memory management stuff and find out where I've screwed up. The codebase is still small (about 1000 lines), so this is easily do-able. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, I'm over my head with this kind of stuff, so I thought I'd throw it out there. I'm on a Linux system, and have poked around with &lt;code&gt;valgrind&lt;/code&gt;, and while not knowing completely what I'm doing, it did report that the &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt;'s destructor was an invalid free. I have to admit to getting the term 'Heap Corruption' from a Google search; any general purpose articles on this sort of stuff would be appreciated as well.&lt;/p&gt;

I haven't made it clear, but what I'm asking for are ways an advice of diagnosing these sort of memory problems. I know the std::string stuff is right, so it's something I've done (or a bug, but there's Not A Problem With Select). I'm sure I could chuck the code I've written up and you very smart folks would see the problem in no time, but I want to add this kind of code analysis to my 'toolbox', as it were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If MathContext is configured to have precision = 2 and rounding mode = ROUND&lt;em&gt;HALF&lt;/em&gt;EVEN&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BigDecimal Number = 0.5294, is rounded to 0.53&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I thought it is a newer technique and used it for rounding purpose. However it turned into nightmare because it started rounding even mentissa part of number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number = 1.5294, is rounded to 1.5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number = 10.5294, is rounded to 10 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number = 101.5294 is rounded to 100 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.... and so on&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is not the behavior I expected for rounding (as precision = 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to be having some logic because from patter I can say that it takes first two digits (as percision is 2) of number and then appends 0s till the no. of digits become same as unrounded amount (checkout the example of 101.5294 ...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thanks for you answer. It makes sense. Can you please explain me MathContext in the context of BigDecimal#round method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's nothing special about &lt;code&gt;BigDecimal.round()&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;vs.&lt;/em&gt; any other &lt;code&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/code&gt; method.  In all cases, the &lt;code&gt;MathContext&lt;/code&gt; specifies the number of significant digits and the rounding technique.  Basically, there are two parts of every &lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/math/MathContext.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;MathContext&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  There's a precision, and there's also a &lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/math/RoundingMode.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;RoundingMode&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The precision again specifies the number of significant digits.  So if you specify &lt;code&gt;123&lt;/code&gt; as a number, and ask for 2 significant digits, you're going to get &lt;code&gt;120&lt;/code&gt;.  It might be clearer if you think in terms of scientific notation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;123&lt;/code&gt; would be &lt;code&gt;1.23e2&lt;/code&gt; in scientific notation.  If you only keep 2 significant digits, then you get &lt;code&gt;1.2e2&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;120&lt;/code&gt;.  By reducing the number of significant digits, we reduce the precision with which we can specify a number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;RoundingMode&lt;/code&gt; part specifies how we should handle the loss of precision.  To reuse the example, if you use &lt;code&gt;123&lt;/code&gt; as the number, and ask for 2 significant digits, you've reduced your precision.  With a &lt;code&gt;RoundingMode&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;HALF_UP&lt;/code&gt; (the default mode), &lt;code&gt;123&lt;/code&gt; will become &lt;code&gt;120&lt;/code&gt;.  With a &lt;code&gt;RoundingMode&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;CEILING&lt;/code&gt;, you'll get &lt;code&gt;130&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;System.out.println(new BigDecimal("123.4",
                   new MathContext(4,RoundingMode.HALF_UP)));
System.out.println(new BigDecimal("123.4",
                   new MathContext(2,RoundingMode.HALF_UP)));
System.out.println(new BigDecimal("123.4",
                   new MathContext(2,RoundingMode.CEILING)));
System.out.println(new BigDecimal("123.4",
                   new MathContext(1,RoundingMode.CEILING)));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outputs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;123.4
1.2E+2
1.3E+2
2E+2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see that both the precision and the rounding mode affect the output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, I haven't found a consistent way to track these kinds of bugs down.  Because there's so many potential problems, there's not a simple checklist to go through.  However, I would recommend the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get comfortable in a debugger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start tromping around in the debugger to see if you can find anything that looks fishy.  Check especially to see what's happening during the &lt;code&gt;exampleString = hello;&lt;/code&gt; line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check to make sure it's actually crashing on the &lt;code&gt;exampleString = hello;&lt;/code&gt; line, and not when exiting some enclosing block (which could cause destructors to fire).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check any pointer magic you might be doing.  Pointer arithmetic, casting, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check all of your allocations and deallocations to make sure they are matched (no double-deallocations).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you aren't returning any references or pointers to objects on the stack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of other things to try, too.  I'm sure some other people will chime in with ideas as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Firefox3 saves its bookmarks and history in an SQLite database&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;SQLite cares deeply that you don't lose your bookmarks, so each time it writes, instructs the kernel to flush it's database file to disk and ensure that it's fully written&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many variants of linux, when told to flush like that, flush EVERY FILE. This may take up to a minute or more if you have background tasks doing any kind of disk intensive stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The kernel makes firefox wait while this flush happens, which locks up the UI.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works at the machine code level, so you don't even have to have the source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reorganize: it's a defrag for indexes. Takes the existing index(es) and defragments the existing pages. However if the pages are not in a contiguous manner, they stays like before. Only the content of the pages are changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebuild: actually it drops the index and rebuilds it from scratch. It means that you will get a completely new index, with defragmented and contiguous pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover with rebuild you can change partitioning or file groups, but with reorganize you can defrag not only the whole index, but also only one partition of the index.&lt;/p&gt;

Then subdivide that by related area, so your &lt;code&gt;FileStorageStrategy&lt;/code&gt; might go in, say, &lt;code&gt;com.domain.subdomain.myapp.storage&lt;/code&gt;, and then there might be specific implementations/subclasses/whatever in &lt;code&gt;com.domain.subdomain.myapp.storage.file&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;com.domain.subdomain.myapp.storage.database&lt;/code&gt;.

Then, the thing you just added is probably the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that if your program is multithreaded, then you probably have larger problems. If not, then you should be able to narrow it down in this way. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance; I have a I/O Completion Port class that throws in the constructor if it can't initialise the port correctly. This uses the Win32 function of CreateIoCompletionPort in the initialiser list. If the handle isn't set correctly - a non-null value - then the constructor will throw an exception. I have never seen this function fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am pretty certain that this (and other functions like it in my code) if they fail will behave correctly, the code is 50 lines long including white-space, so my questions are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) is it worth testing that it will throw&lt;br&gt;
b) and if it is worth testing, how to?&lt;br&gt;
c) should simple wrapper classes as these be unit-tested?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For b) I thought about overriding CreateIoCompletionPort and passing the values through. In the unit test override it and cause it to return 0 when a certain value is passed in. However since this is used in the constructor then this needs to be static. Does this seem valid or not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about HTTP Basic is that virtually all HTTP libraries support it. You will, of course, need to require SSL in this case because sending plaintext passwords over the net is almost universally a bad thing. Basic is preferable to Digest when using SSL because even if the caller already knows that credentials are required, Digest requires an extra roundtrip to exchange the nonce value. With Basic, the callers simply sends the credentials the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

However, you could delegate the authorization to some other component with an existing authorization model.

I will use Java as an example, but it should be easy enough to port the ideas to a C# case:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class MyClass {
    public MyClass() throws MyClassException {

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;C, however, has only one right shift
  operator, &gt;&gt;. Many C compilers choose
  which right shift to perform depending
  on what type of integer is being
  shifted; often signed integers are
  shifted using the arithmetic shift,
  and unsigned integers are shifted
  using the logical shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it sounds like it depends on your compiler.  Also in that article, note that left shift is the same for arithmetic and logical.  I would recommend doing a simple test with some signed and unsigned numbers on the border case (high bit set of course) and see what the result is on your compiler.  I would also recommend avoiding depending on it being one or the other since it seems C has no standard, at least if it is reasonable and possible to avoid such dependence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;No. A table should be named after the entity it represents.
Person, not persons is how you would refer to whoever one of the records represents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again, same thing. The column FirstName really should not be called FirstNames. It all depends on what you want to represent with the column.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Yes. Case it for clarity. If you need to have columns like "FirstName", casing will make it easier to read.

Of course, in your case all output to stderr from anywhere in the process will be redirected to your consumer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, other pieces of the puzzle you may need are &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dye30d82(VS.80).aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;fdopen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bdts1c9x(VS.71).aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;open_osfhandle&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, here's a related example from some &lt;a href="http://hewgill.com/pilot/copilot/" rel="nofollow"&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; I released years ago:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;DWORD CALLBACK DoDebugThread(void *)
{
    AllocConsole();
    SetConsoleTitle("Copilot Debugger");
    // The following is a really disgusting hack to make stdin and stdout attach
    // to the newly created console using the MSVC++ libraries. I hope other
    // operating systems don't need this kind of kludge.. :)
    stdout-&amp;gt;_file = _open_osfhandle((long)GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE), _O_TEXT);
    stdin-&amp;gt;_file  = _open_osfhandle((long)GetStdHandle(STD_INPUT_HANDLE), _O_TEXT);
    debug();
    stdout-&amp;gt;_file = -1;
    stdin-&amp;gt;_file  = -1;
    FreeConsole();
    CPU_run();
    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, the main process was a GUI process which doesn't start with stdio handles at all. It opens a console, then shoves the right handles into stdout and stdin so the debug() function (which was designed as a stdio interactive function) can interact with the newly created console. You should be able to open some pipes and do the same sort of thing to redirect stderr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) No, table names should be singular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it appears to make sense for the simple selection (&lt;code&gt;select * from Orders&lt;/code&gt;) it makes less sense for the OO equivalent (&lt;code&gt;Orders x = new Orders&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A table in a DB is really the set of that entity, it makes more sense once you're using set-logic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;select Orders.*
from Orders inner join Products
    on Orders.Key = Products.Key
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That last line, the actual logic of the join, looks confusing with plural table names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure about always using an alias (as Matt suggests) clears that up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) They should be singular as they only hold 1 property&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Never, if the column name is ambiguous (as above where they both have a column called [Key]) the name of the table (or its alias) can distinguish them well enough. You want queries to be quick to type and simple - prefixes add unnecessary complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Whatever you want, I'd suggest CapitalCase&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any naming standard is better than no standard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no "one true" standard, we all have our preferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is standard already in place, use it. Don't create another standard or muddy the existing standards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use singular names for tables.  Tables tend to be prefixed with the name of the system (or its acronym).  This is useful if the system complex as you can change the prefix to group the tables together logically (ie. reg_customer, reg_booking and regadmin_limits).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For fields we'd expect field names to be include the prefix/acryonm of the table (i.e. cust_address1) and we also prefer the use of a standard set of suffixes ( _id for the PK, _cd for "code", _nm for "name", _nb for "number", _dt for "Date").&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name of the Foriegn key field should be the same as the Primary key field.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i.e. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT cust_nm, cust_add1, booking_dt
FROM reg_customer
INNER JOIN reg_booking
ON reg_customer.cust_id = reg_booking.cust_id
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When developing a new project, I'd recommend you write out all the preferred entity names, prefixes and acronyms and give this document to your developers.  Then, when they decide to create a new table, they can refer to the document rather than "guess" what the table and fields should be called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good naming convention takes time to evolve but once its in place it allows the team to move forward with a common language. A good naming convention grows organically with the project. A good naming convention easily copes with changes during the longest and most important phase of the software lifecycle - service management in production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my answers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, table names should be plural when they refer to a set of &lt;em&gt;trades&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;securities&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;counterparties&lt;/em&gt; for example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes. SQL tables are prefixed with tb&lt;em&gt;, views are prefixed vw&lt;/em&gt;, stored procedures are prefixed usp_ and triggers are prefixed tg_ followed by the database name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Column name should be lower case separated by underscore. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naming is hard but in every organisation there is someone who can name things and in every software team there should be someone who takes responsibility for namings standards and ensures that naming issues like &lt;em&gt;sec_id&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;sec_value&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;security_id&lt;/em&gt; get resolved early before they get baked into the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what are the basic tenets of a good naming convention and standards: -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the language of your client and
your solution domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be descriptive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be consistent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disambiguate, reflect and refactor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dont use abbreviations unless they
are clear to everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dont use SQL reserved keywords as
column names&lt;/li&gt;

One thing you can do is to create a thread-local global variable where you write the ID of the current context. (This can be done with AOP.) Then in the singleton getter, the context ID is fetched from the thread-local to use as a key to the correct "singleton" instance for the calling context. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding AOP there should be no problem using it in applets since, depending on your point-cuts, the advices are woven at compile time and a JAR is added to the runtime dependencies. Hence, no special evidence of AOP should remain at run time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What kind of crazy mobile device do
  you have that has a mouse? :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, windows mobile does not have an actual mouse, but you are mistaken that Windows Mobile .NET does not support the Mouse events.  A click or move on the screen is still considered a "Mouse" event.  It was done this way so that code could port over from full Windows easily.  And this is not a Windows Mobile specific issue.  The TextBox control on Windows does not have native mouse events either.  I just happened to be using Windows Mobile in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit:  And on a side note...as Windows Mobile is built of the WindowsCE core which is often used for embedded desktop systems and Slim Terminal Services clients or "WinTerms" it has support for a hardware mouse and has for a long time.  Most devices just don't have the ports to plug one in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;According to the .Net Framework, the
  MouseDown Event Handler on a TextBox
  is supported. What happens when you

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, that's only there because it inherits it from "Control", as does &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; other Form control.  It is however, overridden (and changed to private I believe) in the TextBox class.  So it will not show up in IntelliSense in Visual Studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, you actually can write the code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;textBox1.MouseDown += new System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventHandler(this.textBox1_MouseDown);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and it will compile and run just fine, the only problem is that textBox1_MouseDown() will not be fired when you tap the TextBox control.  I assume this is because of the Event being overridden internally.  I don't even want to change what's happening on the event internally, I just want to add my own event handler to that event so I can fire some custom code as you could with any other event.&lt;/p&gt;

However, I feel that packaging an application is still an issue.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OS X natively provides an easy mechanism for wrapping Java apps in native application bundles, but producing an app for Windows/Linux that doesn't require the user to run an ugly batch file or click on a .jar is still a hassle.  Possibly that's not such an issue on Linux, where the user is likely to be a little more tech-savvy, but on Windows I'd like to have a regular .exe for him/her to run.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embedded in an SWF file&lt;/strong&gt; using the Flash authoring tool (supported in Flash Player 6 and later). The entire file must be transferred before playback can begin. Changing the video requires rebuilding the SWF file.[citation needed]&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progressive download via HTTP&lt;/strong&gt; (supported in Flash Player 7 and later). This method uses ActionScript to include an externally hosted Flash Video file client-side for playback. Progressive download has several advantages, including buffering, use of generic HTTP servers, and the ability to reuse a single SWF player for multiple Flash Video sources. Flash Player 8 includes support for random access within video files using the partial download functionality of HTTP, sometimes this is referred to as streaming. However, unlike streaming using RTMP, HTTP "streaming" does not support real-time broadcasting. Streaming via HTTP requires a custom player and the injection of specific Flash Video metadata containing the exact starting position in bytes and timecode of each keyframe. Using this specific information, a custom Flash Video player can request any part of the Flash Video file starting at a specified keyframe. For example, Google Video and Youtube support progressive downloading and can seek to any part of the video before buffering is complete. The server-side part of this "HTTP pseudo-streaming" method is fairly simple to implement, for example in PHP, as an Apache HTTPD module, or a lighttpd module. Rich Media Project provides players and Flash components compatible with "HTTP pseudo-streaming" method.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streamed via RTMP to the Flash Player&lt;/strong&gt; using the Flash Media Server (formerly called Flash Communication Server), VCS, ElectroServer, Wowza Pro or the open source Red5 server. As of April 2008, there are four stream recorders available for this protocol, re-encoding screencast software excluded.&lt;/p&gt;

It also allows to include more and more stuff into the project in the long run, e.g. object oriented programming (one worm is one object with the chance to have two worms at the same time) with inheritance (go from "Snakes" to "Tron" or the other way around, where the worm slightly changes behavior).&lt;/p&gt;

The problem is that the OP's data seems to be comma delimited and (Solaris 8's) uniq doesn't allow you any way specify the record separator, so there wasn't a super clean way to do the preprocessing using standard unix tools.  I don't think it would be any faster so I'm not going to look up the exact options, but you could do something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cut -d, -f8 &amp;lt;infile.txt | sort | uniq -d | xargs -i grep {} infile.txt &amp;gt;outfile.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's not very good because it executes grep for every line containing a duplicate key.  You could probably massage the uniq output into a single regexp to feed to grep, but the benefit would only be known if the OP posts expected ratio of lines containing suspected duplicate keys to total lines in the file.&lt;/p&gt;

 How can I remove duplicate elements from a list or array?
   (contributed by brian d foy)

   Use a hash. When you think the words "unique" or "duplicated", think
   "hash keys".

   If you don't care about the order of the elements, you could just
   create the hash then extract the keys. It's not important how you
   create that hash: just that you use "keys" to get the unique elements.

       my %hash   = map { $_, 1 } @array;
       # or a hash slice: @hash{ @array } = ();
       # or a foreach: $hash{$_} = 1 foreach ( @array );

       my @unique = keys %hash;

   If you want to use a module, try the "uniq" function from
   "List::MoreUtils". In list context it returns the unique elements,
   preserving their order in the list. In scalar context, it returns the
   number of unique elements.

       use List::MoreUtils qw(uniq);

       my @unique = uniq( 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 5, 7 ); # 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
       my $unique = uniq( 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 5, 7 ); # 7

   You can also go through each element and skip the ones you've seen
   before. Use a hash to keep track. The first time the loop sees an
   element, that element has no key in %Seen. The "next" statement creates
   the key and immediately uses its value, which is "undef", so the loop
   continues to the "push" and increments the value for that key. The next
   time the loop sees that same element, its key exists in the hash and
   the value for that key is true (since it's not 0 or "undef"), so the
   next skips that iteration and the loop goes to the next element.

       my @unique = ();
       my %seen   = ();

       foreach my $elem ( @array )
       {
         next if $seen{ $elem }++;
         push @unique, $elem;
       }

   You can write this more briefly using a grep, which does the same
   thing.

       my %seen = ();
       my @unique = grep { ! $seen{ $_ }++ } @array;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of this is n^2 (maybe an extra log factor for the set?) for the iteration and s * log(s) for the sorting where s is the size of the set. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The size of the set could be as big as n*(n-1)/2 for example if X = [1,2,4,...,2^n]. So if you want to generate this list it will take at least n^2/2 in the worst case since this is the size of the output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However if you want to select the first k elements of the result you can do this in O(kn) using a selection algorithm for sorted X+Y matrices by Frederickson and Johnson (&lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.0936" rel="nofollow" title="Presentation Zen"&gt;see here for gory details)&lt;/a&gt;.

In C#, you'd use the XmlDocument class. For example, if your XML file looked something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Document&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;Piece&amp;gt;
     Some text
  &amp;lt;/Piece&amp;gt;

     Some other text
  &amp;lt;/Piece&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/Document&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then you'd use code like this to extract all of the Pieces:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;XmlDocument doc = new XmlDocument();
doc.Load("&amp;lt;path to xml file&amp;gt;");
XmlNodeList nl = doc.GetElementsByTagName("Piece");
foreach (XmlNode n in nl)
{
    // Do something with each Piece node
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you've got the nodes, you can do something with them in your code, or you can transfer the entire text of the node to its own XML document and act on that as if it were an independent piece of XML (including saving it back to disk, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use logging. Either implement your own logging utilities, or a common one (e.g. &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/JS_Modules#Logging" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/JS_Modules#Logging&lt;/a&gt; although I haven't used that one yet; see also &lt;a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Using_JavaScript_code_modules" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Using_JavaScript_code_modules&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When writing your code, use the JS Shell and the Live XUL Editor (from the &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7434" rel="nofollow"&gt;Extension developer's extension&lt;/a&gt;) along with the DOM inspector for prototyping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Setting_up_extension_development_environment" rel="nofollow"&gt;Set up a profile for development&lt;/a&gt;, then debug by tweaking the source code (adding logging and alert()s :) and reloading the affected window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When possible, write unit tests using the &lt;a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Mozilla_automated_testing" rel="nofollow"&gt;available frameworks&lt;/a&gt; (they're not widely used with code outside the Mozilla tree currently)&lt;/li&gt;

If you only two huge "top level" tags, it will be extremely hard to be able to split it in a way that makes it possible to both merge it back together and read it piece by piece as valid xml.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Given a document with a lot of seperate pieces like the ones in DannySmurfs example, it should be fairly easy.&lt;br /&gt;
Some rough code in Pseudo C# :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int nrOfPieces = 5;
XmlDocument xmlOriginal = some input parameter..

// construct the list we need, and fill it with XmlDocuments..
var xmlList = new List&amp;lt;XmlDocument&amp;gt;();
for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; nrOfPieces ; i++)
{
    var xmlDoc = new XmlDocument();
    xmlDoc.ChildNodes.Add(new XmlNode(xmlOriginal.FistNode.Name));
    xmlList.Add(xmlDoc);
}

var nodeList = xmlOriginal.GetElementsByTagName("Piece")M
// Copy the nodes from the original into the pieces..
for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; nodeList .Count; i++)
{
    var xmlDoc = xmlList[i % nrOfPieces];
    var nodeToCopy = nodeList[i].Clone();
    xmlDoc.FirstNode.ChildNodes.Add(nodeToCopy);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should give you n docs with correct xml and the possibility to merge them back together.&lt;br /&gt;
But again, it depends on the xml file.&lt;/p&gt;

In my experience, though, if you're just reading the file, doing some processing (i.e., breaking it up) and then continuing on with your work, the XmlDocument is going to go through it's create/read/collect cycle so quickly that it likely won't matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, that depends on what a "large" file is. If it's a 30 MB XML file (which I would consider large for an XML file), it probably won't make any difference. If it's a 500 MB XML file, using XmlDocument will become extremely problematic on systems without a significant amount of RAM (in that case, however, I'd argue that the time to manually pick through the file with a XmlReader would be the more significant impediment).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Uses pixel height instead of line height: more accurate handling of line wrap if a proportional font is used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accepts either ID or element as input&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accepts an optional max height param - useful if you'd rather not let the text area grow beyond a certain size (keep it all on-screen, avoid breaking layout, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tested on Firefox 3 and IE6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code:&lt;/strong&gt; 
(plain vanilla Javascript)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function FitToContent(id, maxHeight)
{
   var text = id &amp;amp;&amp;amp; id.style ? id : document.getElementById(id);

   /* Accounts for rows being deleted, pixel value may need adjusting */

   }

You could use the old-school C way and call fopen/fread/fclose, or you could use the C++ fstream facilities (ifstream/ofstream), or if you're using MFC, use the CFile class, which provides functions to accomplish actual file operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these are suitable for both text and binary, though none have a specific readline functionality. What you'd most likely do instead in that case is use the fstream classes (fstream.h) and use the stream operators (&amp;lt;&amp;lt; and &gt;&gt;) or the read function to read/write blocks of text:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int nsize = 10;
char *somedata;
ifstream myfile;
myfile.open("&amp;lt;path to file&amp;gt;");
myfile.read(somedata,nsize);
myfile.close();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that, if you're using Visual Studio 2005 or higher, traditional fstream may not be available (there's a new Microsoft implementation, which is slightly different, but accomplishes the same thing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with a classic example is that you are forced to close the file by yourself, meaning that you will have to bend your architecture to this need. RAII makes use of the automatic destructor call in C++ to close the file for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class FileOpener
{
public:
    FileOpener(std::fstream&amp;amp; file, const char* fileName): m_file(file)
    { 
     m_file.open(fileName); 
    }
    ~FileOpeneer()
    { 
     file.close(); 
    }

private:
    std::fstream&amp;amp; m_file;
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now use this class in your code like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int nsize = 10;
char *somedata;
ifstream myfile;
FileOpener opener(myfile, "&amp;lt;path to file&amp;gt;");
myfile.read(somedata,nsize);
// myfile is closed automatically when opener destructor is called
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Doing this with Active Record would require that you're selecting all the columns, but only using City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, varying implementations will handle this differently. Nevertheless, it's one issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you can get around this by creating a new model for the specific thing you're trying to do, but some people would argue that it's more effort than the benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

How do I set up SVN to email a distribution list on each commit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; I'm running clients on Windows and the Apache Subversion server on Linux. The answers below for various platforms will likely be useful to other people though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's a good way to remove both the quotes and the comma from this so I can put it into an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; field?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data is actually already in a MySQL table, so I need to be able to this using SQL. Sorry for the mixup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if all you need is a unique identifier, I suggest you create one yourself using some cryptographic algorithm and store it in a cookie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you really need to know the MAC address of the computer AND you are developing for internal applications, then I suggest you use an external component to do that: ActiveX for IE, XPCOM for Firefox (installed as an extension).&lt;/p&gt;
