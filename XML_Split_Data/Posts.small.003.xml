That's because the select element is considered an ActiveX object and is on top of every HTML element in the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already saw people hiding selects when opening a popup div, that leads to pretty bad user experience having controls disappearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FogBugz actually had a pretty smart solution (before v6) of turning every select into text boxes when a popup was displayed. This solved the bug and tricked the user eye but the behavior was not perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another solution is in FogBugz 6 where they no more use the select element and recoded it everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last solution I currently use is messing up the IE rendering engine and force it to render the absolutely positioned &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; as an ActiveX element too, ensuring it can live over a select element. This is achieved by placing an invisible &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; inside the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and styling it with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;#MyDiv iframe
{
    position: absolute;
    z-index: -1;
    filter: mask();
    border: 0;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;

    height: 9999px;
    overflow: hidden;
}

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: The purpose of this question is as much informative as it is a real question.

&lt;p&gt;In a situation where you have perpetual access to the code, I don't think standards-compliance is all that important, since you can always make changes to the code if something breaks. If you don't have perpetual access (ie, you sign off on the code and it becomes someone else's responsibility), it's probably best to be as standards-compliant as possible to minimize maintenance headaches later... even if you never have to deal with the code again, your reputation persists and can be transmitted to other potential clients, and many teams like to blame the previous developer(s) for problems that come up.&lt;/p&gt;

Just because something works today doesn't mean it will work tomorrow: if you're relying on a particular HTML/CSS hack or even if you've just been a little lax in emitting strictly valid code, the next iteration of browsers could well break. Doing it once the right way minimises this problem (though does not entirely mitigate it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a certain element of pragmatism to take here, though. I'd certainly do all I could for a client's site to be valid, but I would be willing to take more risks in my own space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a kind of TextMate clone for Windows called simply "E" (&lt;a href="http://www.e-texteditor.com" rel="nofollow" title="The Subversion Book: Repository hooks"&gt;e-texteditor.com&lt;/a&gt;). Its author promised that there will be a Linux version soon.  Even if you already picked your favourite, TextMate (or E) is worth a look, simply because it is different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say that there are mainly four different families of text editors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;classic menubar-based editors like WinEdit, Gedit or BBEdit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emacs and its brethren XEmacs, Aquamacs etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VI / Vim / Cream and the like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TextMate and E&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can differenciate between these families by their different paradigms of usage:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classic editors rely mainly on a menubar and some Ctrl-key shortcuts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emacs-style editing uses highly sophisticated keyboard commands like C-x-s and even whole words to evoke commands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VI is modebased and is operated by single-key commands or whole words.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TextMate is based on Snippets and classic shortcuts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emacs and TextMate are also easily extensible by user-created scripts in Lisp (Emacs) or any other command-line-language (TextMate). (Classic editors and VI are also extendable, but the effort is usually considerably bigger)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would recommend that everyone tried at least one good example of each of these families (if possible) and find out what suits them best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NORECOVERY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instructs the restore operation to not roll back any uncommitted transactions. Either the NORECOVERY or STANDBY option must be specified if another transaction log has to be applied. If neither NORECOVERY, RECOVERY, or STANDBY is specified, RECOVERY is the default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SQL Server requires that the WITH NORECOVERY option be used on all but the final RESTORE statement when restoring a database backup and multiple transaction logs, or when multiple RESTORE statements are needed (for example, a full database backup followed by a differential database backup).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note  When specifying the NORECOVERY option, the database is not usable in this intermediate, nonrecovered state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When used with a file or filegroup restore operation, NORECOVERY forces the database to remain in the restoring state after the restore operation. This is useful in either of these situations: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A restore script is being run and the log is always being applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sequence of file restores is used and the database is not intended to be usable between two of the restore operations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RECOVERY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instructs the restore operation to roll back any uncommitted transactions. After the recovery process, the database is ready for use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If subsequent RESTORE operations (RESTORE LOG, or RESTORE DATABASE from differential) are planned, NORECOVERY or STANDBY should be specified instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If neither NORECOVERY, RECOVERY, or STANDBY is specified, RECOVERY is the default. When restoring backup sets from an earlier version of SQL Server, a database upgrade may be required. This upgrade is performed automatically when WITH RECOVERY is specified. For more information, see Transaction Log Backups .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STANDBY&lt;/strong&gt; = undo&lt;em&gt;file&lt;/em&gt;name&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifies the undo file name so the recovery effects can be undone. The size required for the undo file depends on the volume of undo actions resulting from uncommitted transactions. If neither NORECOVERY, RECOVERY, or STANDBY is specified, RECOVERY is the default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;STANDBY allows a database to be brought up for read-only access between transaction log restores and can be used with either warm standby server situations or special recovery situations in which it is useful to inspect the database between log restores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the specified undo file name does not exist, SQL Server creates it. If the file does exist, SQL Server overwrites it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same undo file can be used for consecutive restores of the same database. For more information, see Using Standby Servers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important  If free disk space is exhausted on the drive containing the specified undo file name, the restore operation stops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;STANDBY is not allowed when a database upgrade is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I usually do when I have to do something like this is to first replace all separating quotes and (usually) semicolons by tabs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Search:&lt;/em&gt; ";"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Replace:&lt;/em&gt; \t&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I know in which column my affected values will be I then do another search and replace:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Search:&lt;/em&gt; ^([\t]+)\t([\t]+)\t([0-9]+),([0-9]+)\t&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Replace:&lt;/em&gt; \1\t\2\t\3\4\t&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... given the value with the comma is in the third column.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to start with an "^" to make sure that it starts at the beginning of a line. Then you repeat ([0-9]+)\t as often as there are columns that you just want to leave as they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;([0-9]+),([0-9]+) searches for values where there is a number, then a comma and then another number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the replace string we use \1 and \2 to just keep the values from the edited line, separating them with \t (tab). Then we put \3\4 (no tab between) to put the two components of the number without the comma right after each other. All values after that will be left alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need your file to have semicolon to separate the elements, you then can go on and replace the tabs with semicolons. However then - if you leave out the quotes - you'll have to make sure that the text values do not contain any semicolons themselves. That's why I prefer to use TAB as column separator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually do that in an ordinary text editor (EditPlus) that supports RegExp, but the same regexps can be used in any programming language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that I can't seem to get it centered properly. No matter what I set for the Y coordinate of the location of the string render, it always comes out lower than that and the larger the text size the greater the Y offset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, at text size 12, the offset is about 4, but at 32 the offset is about 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want the character to vertically take up most of the rectangle it's being drawn in and be centered horizontally. Here's my basic code. &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; is referencing the user control it's being drawn in.&lt;/p&gt;

float pady = ((float)this.Size.Height) * (0.05F);

&lt;p&gt;In simple terms (and not a copy-paste out of the SQLBOL) so you can understand the concepts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RESTORE WITH RECOVERY uses the backup media file (eg. fulldata.bak) to restore the database to back to the time that backup file was created.  This is great if you want to go back in time to restore the database to an earlier state - like when developing a system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to restore the database TO THE VERY LATEST DATA, (i.e. like if your doing a system Disaster Recovery and you cannot lose any data) then you want to restore that backup AND THEN all the transaction logs created since that backup.  This is when you use RESTORE NORECOVERY.  It will allow you to restore the later transaction logs right up to the point of failure (as long as you have them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RECOVERY WITH STANDBY is the ability to restore the database up to a parital date (like NORECOVERY above) but to allow the database still to be used READONLY. New transaction logs can still be applied to the database to keep it up to date (a standby server).  Use this when it would take too long to restore a full database in order to Return To Operations the system.  (ie. if you have a multi TB database that would take 16 hours to restore, but could receive transaction log updates every 15 minutes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a bit like a mirror server - but without having "every single transaction" send to the backup server in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

    string ParentType { get; }
    int ParentId { get; }

    List&amp;lt;IChild&amp;gt; GetChildren()

&lt;p&gt;This seems to me to be a better mechanism for many interfaces.  They no longer need an abstract base to share this code, and functionally the code works the same. This could make code more maintainable and easier to test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only disadvantage being that an abstract bases implementation can be virtual, but can that be worked around (would an instance method hide an extension method with the same name? would it be confusing code to do so?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I see the tendency with extension methods is to end up with them everywhere. I'd be particularly careful having any on .Net value types without a great deal of peer review (I think the only one we have on string is a &lt;code&gt;.SplitToDictionary()&lt;/code&gt; - similar to &lt;code&gt;.Split()&lt;/code&gt; but taking a key-value delimiter too)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm trying to avoid lots of levels of abstract base classes - the classes implementing these models mostly already have base classes. I think this model could be more maintainable and less overly-coupled than adding further object hierarchies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**1) If a function which returns an object has 'alloc', 'create' or 'copy' in its name then the object is yours. You must call [object release] when you are finished with it. Or CFRelease(object) if it's a Core-Foundation object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former was by far the better written, and taught me almost as much about LINQ in a single chapter than the latter did in a whole book.  LINQ is built on a lot of foundation, and C# in Depth builds it up from the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second book is a whole lot better than nothing, and you will learn things specifically about LINQ that you won't learn in the first.  But the first book will give you much better foundation, and puts up at least a token perspective instead of more or less blindly following the MS line.

It's a set of language enhancements built into C# and VB. Basically, what you get is a bunch of  standard query operators that can be applied to any IEnumerable of type T. There's a lot of different linq providers for specific types of data- for example, there's linq to xml, linq to entities, even linq to sharepoint. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started with linq, in all its many forms, I suggest the book &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1590597893" rel="nofollow" title="Cocoa Programming for Mac OSX"&gt;Pro Linq by Joseph C. Rattz.&lt;/a&gt; It's an excellent overview of Linq. He takes a ground-up approach, first describing all the language features (like Lambda Expressions and Expression Trees) that Linq is built on, and then moving on to some standard linq provider implementations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, here's a pretty good MSDN article describing Linq: &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb308959.aspx" rel="nofollow" title="Using Subversion hooks to send out build emails"&gt;LINQ: .NET Language-Integrated Query&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Linq to Sql is a linq provider written specifically for SQL Server. Included in this provider is an OR/M, that gives you some handy-dandy functionality (like typing out all your sql tables, so you get a robust design-time view of your database schema.) It's totally awesome, and for me, has greatly speed up development time when working with a sql database.

My understanding is that you are breaking a page down into set of "composite" user controls that contain other controls, and you want to decide whether to use properties for setting values. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess this really depends on how the user controls are designed and whether they are being dynamically added to a page etc (one possible scenario). I have a personal preference for specifying stuff in a constructor or using a factory method to create controls. I assume responsibility at creation for making sure that everything is set. My experience with properties is that I'll sometimes forget to set something and not realize my mistake. Your point about setting properties or using a sub, and everything being populated doesn't make a lot of sense to me. If you have some sort of dependency and need something else to be loaded then this could happen irrespective of whether it's a property or sub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would refer to any book on VB.NET/C#/OOP to see the syntax for interfaces. Interfaces basically describe a contract for a class. If you have class A and B and both implement an interface called ITime then both will provide all of the methods defined on ITime. They can still add their own methods but they must at minimum include an implementation of ITime's methods (eg. we might have GetDate(), GetCurrentTime() as methods on ITime). An interface doesn't tell class A or B how those methods should work - just their name, parameters and return type. Lookup inheritance in an OOP book for more information on how interfaces inheritance is different from implementation inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write your own printing DLL using the Win32 API (in C/C++ for instance), then use it from your service with P/Invoke (works fine)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write your own printing COM+ component, then uses it from your service. I have chosen this solution with success recently (but it was third party COM+ component, not own written) It works absolutely fine too.&lt;/li&gt;

    }

    private Font FindBestFitFont(Graphics g, String text, Font font, Size proposedSize)

One tier for UI, one for business logic, and for persisting data. The last one you say? Domain objects and interfaces. This makes it possible to load up any one or two of the main tiers plus the domain "tier", and the code should work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It relies heavily on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection" rel="nofollow"&gt;dependency injection&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control" rel="nofollow"&gt;Inversion of Control&lt;/a&gt; principles.
The data/persistence tier does only two things. It creates, reads, updates and deletes data, and maps it to the domain object format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UI tier does the exact opposite. It displays and receives data in a way that the user can relate to, and maps that output/input to and from the domain object format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The business logic tier just need to know one thing. Business logic. It does not care about where the data is from, and it does not care about where the data tier is putting it. It knows that it should flag an account that was just overdrawn, how to physically do that is not part of its job really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The domain objects themselves does not have any logic, they are just containers for passing data between the tiers. This means that you can load the domain objects and interfaces without having to think at all about dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day I feel that I have a pretty clear code base with clearly separated tiers. And with some strict interfaces and good base classes most of the coding is just telling the software what to do when X happens. Just how it is supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;

There are quite a few, as the other guys pointed out, and none of them seem to prevail. There was some interesting project called &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/tesla-pylons-elixir/" rel="nofollow" title="Cocoa Programming for Mac OSX"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, which worked pretty well, and had additional features that pylons miss (migrations etc.), but seems unmaintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I would agree, that the best thing for your situation would be pylons, it definitely is not the easiest frameworks to learn. There is quite a learning curve to pylons, as there is to django by the way. But, since pylons has all the rails helpers ported, I would suggest you should also check Rails and maybe merb (both written in Ruby), as they might give you (especially rails) an easy introduction to the web frameworks and sort of "feel" of what it is to the framework, what to expect, what's cool and so on. Anyhow, what I feel with Python web framework is that there is a pethora of choices (template systems, ORMs and so on) and the user, who has just heard of web frameworks gets lost in translation. There's just to much to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also prefer Python over Ruby, but when web frameworks are concerned I have to give to DHH - Rails framework simply rocks as far as developing code is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

It helped a bit, but &lt;code&gt;3600&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be fine according to the docs. The errors still happen semi-regularly.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find out what minimum requrements you want to put on a plugin writer. Then make one or more Interfaces that the writer must implement for your code to know when and where to execute the code.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make an API the writer can use to access some of the functionality in your code.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could also make a base class the writer must inherit. This will make wiring up the API easier. Then use some kind of reflection to scan a directory, and load the classes you find that matches your requirements.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people also make a scripting language for their system, or implements an interpreter for a subset of an existing language. This is also a possible route to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, for example, you had a program written in C, for Windows, plugins would be written for your program as DLLs.  At runtime, you would manually load these DLLs, and expose some interface to them.  For example, the DLLs might expose a &lt;code&gt;gimme_the_interface()&lt;/code&gt; function which could accept a structure filled with function pointers.  These function pointers would allow the DLL to make calls, register callbacks, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were in C++, you would use the DLL system, except you would probably pass an object pointer instead of a struct, and the object would implement an interface which provided functionality (accomplishing the same thing as the struct, but less ugly).  For Java, you would load class files on-demand instead of DLLs, but the basic idea would be the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all cases, you'll need to define a standard interface between your code and the plugins, so that you can initialize the plugins, and so the plugins can interact with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. If you'd like to see a good example of a C++ plugin system, check out the &lt;a href="http://foobar2000.com/SDK.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;foobar2000 SDK&lt;/a&gt;.  I haven't used it in quite a while, but it used to be really well done.  I assume it still is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, I think the answer is no. You can't write extensible code by default, it will be both hard to write/extend and awfully inefficient (Mozilla started with the idea of being very extensible, used XPCOM everywhere, and now they realized it was a mistake and started to remove it where it doesn't make sense).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what makes sense to do is to identify the pieces of your system that can be meaningfully extended and support a proper API for these cases (e.g. language support plug-ins in an editor). You'd use the relevant patterns, but the specific implementation depends on your platform/language choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMO, it also helps to use a dynamic language - makes it possible to tweak the core code at run time (when absolutely necessary). I appreciated that Mozilla's extensibility works that way when writing Firefox extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

Here was a test case I ran purely a MySQL, SQL solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The table is just a single column (alpha) that is a varchar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mysql&amp;gt; desc t;


+-------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+

+-------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add a record&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mysql&amp;gt; insert into t values('"1,000,000"');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)


mysql&amp;gt; select * from t;


+-------------+
| alpha       |

+---------+
| alpha   |
+---------+
| 1000000 | 
+---------+
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the end the statement I used was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;UPDATE table
   SET field_name = replace( replace(field_name, ',', ''), '"', '' );
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at the &lt;a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/string-functions.html#function_replace"&gt;MySQL Documentation&lt;/a&gt; and it didn't look like I could do the regular expressions find &lt;em&gt;and replace&lt;/em&gt;.  Although you could, like &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7917/remove-quotes-and-commas-from-a-string-in-mysql#8135"&gt;Eldila&lt;/a&gt;, use a regular expression for a find and then an alternative solution for replace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also be careful with &lt;code&gt;s/"(\d+),(\d+)"/$1$2/&lt;/code&gt; because what if the number has more then just a single comma, for instance "1,000,000" you're going to want to do a global replace (in perl that is &lt;code&gt;s///g&lt;/code&gt;). But even with a global replace the replacement starts where you last left off (unless perl is different), and would miss the every other comma separated group.  A possible solution would be to make the first (\d+) optional like so &lt;code&gt;s/(\d+)?,(\d+)/$1$2/g&lt;/code&gt; and in this case I would need a second find and replace to strip the quotes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some ruby examples of the regular expressions acting on just the string "1,000,000", notice there are NOT double quote inside the string, this is just a string of the number itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; "1,000,000".sub( /(\d+),(\d+)/, '\1\2' )
# =&amp;gt; "1000,000"  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; "1,000,000".gsub( /(\d+),(\d+)/, '\1\2' )
# =&amp;gt; "1000,000"  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; "1,000,000".gsub( /(\d+)?,(\d+)/, '\1\2' )
# =&amp;gt; "1000000"  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; "1,000,000".gsub( /[,"]/, '' )
# =&amp;gt; "1000000"  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; "1,000,000".gsub( /[^0-9]/, '' )

&lt;p&gt;By instrumenting, I mean collecting data regarding usage and performance of the system.

&lt;li&gt;How are you processing the instrumented data?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are you keeping your UI code clean with this instrumentation logic?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, I am implementing my UI in WPF, so this will provide extra challenges compared to instrumenting a web-based application. (i.e. need to transfer the instrumented data back to a central location, etc). That said, I feel the technology may provide an easier implementation of instrumentation via concepts like attached properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all different things. They mostly follow that design pattern, but extend and modify it in many different ways, so before anyone says "ActiveRecord Sucks" it needs to be qualified by saying "which ActiveRecord, there's heaps?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm only familiar with Rails' ActiveRecord, I'll try address all the complaints which have been raised in context of using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The problem that I see with Active Records is, that it's always just about one table&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Person
    belongs_to :company
end
people = Person.find(:all, :include =&amp;gt; :company )
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This generates SQL with &lt;code&gt;LEFT JOIN companies on companies.id = person.company_id&lt;/code&gt;, and automatically generates associated Company objects so you can do &lt;code&gt;people.first.company&lt;/code&gt; and it doesn't need to hit the database because the data is already present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@pix0r&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The inherent problem with Active Record is that database queries are automatically generated and executed to populate objects and modify database records&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;person = Person.find_by_sql("giant complicated sql query")
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is discouraged as it's ugly, but for the cases where you just plain and simply need to write raw SQL, it's easily done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@Tim Sullivan&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;...and you select several instances of the model, you're basically doing a "select * from ..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;people = Person.find(:all, :select=&amp;gt;'name, id')
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will only select the name and ID columns from the database, all the other 'attributes' in the mapped objects will just be nil, unless you manually reload that object, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've done what Vaibhav has done many times, and it's a good "quick and dirty" way to get data into a database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need to do this a few times, or on some type of schedule, then a more reliable way is to load the CSV data "as-is" into a work table (i.e customer_dataload) and then use standard SQL statements to populate the missing fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I don't know Firebird syntax - but something like...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;UPDATE person
SET id = (SELECT newguid() FROM createguid)

UPDATE person
SET cityid = (SELECT cityid FROM cities WHERE person.cityname = cities.cityname)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, it's much faster (and more reliable) to get the data INTO the database and then fix the data than to try to fix the data during the upload.  You also get the benefit of transactions to allow you to ROLLBACK if it does not work!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of us are maintaining sites built in 1999. If you find an SQL injection vulnerability in ASP 3.0, maybe this will help.  Don't do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;DBConn.Execute("UPDATE members SET photo = '" + gblSQLSafe(fileName) + "' WHERE memberID = " + memberid);

&lt;p&gt;Here, gblSQLSafe() doubles up single quotes in the string. Instead do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;objCmd.CommandType = adCmdText;
objCmd.CommandText = "UPDATE members SET photo = @filename WHERE memberID = @memberID";
objCmd.Parameters.Append(objCmd.CreateParameter("@memberID", adInteger, adParamInput, 4, memberid ));
objCmd.Parameters.Append(objCmd.CreateParameter("@filename", adVarChar, adParamInput, 510, fileName));
objCmd.Execute(adExecuteNoRecords);
gblDelobjParams(objCmd);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, if you have 50 legacy sites with no time to actually change all the darned code on all of them, try something like &lt;a href="http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/473/using-urlscan" rel="nofollow" title="excanvas"&gt;UrlScan&lt;/a&gt; for iis6 and 7; &lt;a href="http://www.applicure.com/?page=dotDefender" rel="nofollow"&gt;dotDefender&lt;/a&gt; for pay which also covers Apache or IIS 5-7 or &lt;a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IIS6SQLInjection" rel="nofollow"&gt;SQL Injection sanitation ISAPI&lt;/a&gt; for IIS6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any keyword you can use an underscore before the name of the attribute.  Instead of class you use _class.  Since class is a keyword in C#, and also the name of the attribute in HTML.  Now, "id" isn't a keyword in C#, but perhaps it is in another .NET language that they want to support.  From what I can tell, it's not a keyword in VB.NET, F#, or Ruby so maybe it is a mistake that they force you to use an underscore with it.&lt;/p&gt;

If I'm not extending something I just go with what is simplest. com.mydomain.domain for Domain Objects (although if you have a ton of domain objects this package could get a bit unwieldy).
For domain specific constants, I actually put them as public constants in the most related class. For example, if I have a "Member" class and have a maximum member name length constant, I put it in the Member class. Some shops make a separate Constants class but I don't see the value in lumping unrelated numbers and strings into a single class. I've seen some other shops try to solve this problem by creating SEPARATE Constants classes, but that just seems like a waste of time and the result is too confusing.

&lt;p&gt;An access violation sounds like an actual bug in your code. It's not something I'd expect the underlying C/++ Runtime to be throwing and catching internally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 'first-chance-exceptions' feature is so you can intercept things which get 'caught' in code, using the debugger, and have a look. If there's nothing 'catching' that exception (which makes sense, why on earth would you catch and ignore access violations?), then it will trigger the debugger regardless of what options you may have set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Implement your own &lt;code&gt;Contains()&lt;/code&gt; method by looping through all items in the collection to see if one of them is what you are looking for. This seems to be the "best practice" approach.&lt;/li&gt;

catch(Exception e)

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Ryan Fox's comments on the exceptional case is perfect, I concur&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for performance, it depends on the indexer on the collection.  C# lets you override the indexer operator, so if it is doing a for loop like the contains method you would write, then it will be just as slow (with maybe a few nanoseconds slower due to the try/catch... but nothing to worry about unless that code itself is within a huge loop).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the indexer is O(1) (or even O(log(n))... or anything faster than O(n)), then the try/catch solution would be faster of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I am assuming the indexer is throwing the exception, if it is returning null, you could of course just check for null and not use the try/catch.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In mysql and php I use &lt;code&gt;mysql_real_escape_string&lt;/code&gt; to protect agains injection. I assume this is sufficient&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe not in all cases. &lt;a href="http://ilia.ws/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ilia Alshanetsky&lt;/a&gt; is perhaps the world's foremost authority on PHP security and he points out that &lt;code&gt;mysql_real_escape_string&lt;/code&gt; can be prone to precisely the same character set vulnerability that has made addslashes rightly derided. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ilia.ws/archives/103-mysql_real_escape_string-versus-Prepared-Statements.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;code&gt;mysql_real_escape_string()&lt;/code&gt; versus Prepared Statements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think in view of this that prepared statements are perhaps the only best practice way to prevent sql injection attacks in PHP. But Ilia points out that there are caveats even here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solution is to use prepared statements, which are supported by nearly all PHP database extensions with the notable exceptions of MySQL (ext/mysql) and SQLite2 (ext/sqlite). So, to be on the safe side, I'd recommend using the PDO interface to talks with those databases or in the case of MySQL using the newer MySQLi (ext/mysqli) extension. Those interfaces provide prepared statement support, which allows for separation between query structure and the query parameters. It should be noted that while PDO does emulated prepared statements for older versions of MySQL that do not support them natively, emulation is still prone to the same kind of issues demonstrated here and in Chris article. Therefore for security reasons you should definitely consider upgrading to a more modern version of MySQL and SQLite (SQLite 3).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I strongly recommend buying his book &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0973862106" rel="nofollow"&gt;phpArchitect's Guide to PHP Security&lt;/a&gt;; it's to be preferred over Shiflett's &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/059600656X" rel="nofollow"&gt;Essential PHP Security&lt;/a&gt; in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's also important to validate data before using it in the query; ensure that variables are initialised before use, that integers are cast as such before use, and ideally check their range to ensure they're not out of bounds. For example, this is how we would initialise and cast integer input:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$userID = (isset($_GET['userID'])) ? (int) $_GET['userID'] : 0;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Whilst some people might be happy to say that looping through the collection is less efficient to throwing an exception, there is an overhead to throwing an exception. I would also question why you are using a collection to access an item by key when you would be better suited to using a dictionary or hashtable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main problem with this code however, is that regardless of the type of exception thrown, you are always going to be left with the same result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, an exception could be thrown because the object doesn't exist in the collection, or because the collection itself is null or because you can't cast myCollect[myObject] to aObject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these exceptions will get handled in the same way, which may not be your intention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are a couple of nice articles on when and where it is usally considered acceptable to throw exceptions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I particularly like this quote from the second article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is important that exceptions are
  thrown only when an unexpected or
  invalid activity occurs that prevents
  a method from completing its normal
  function. Exception handling
  introduces a small overhead and lowers
  performance so should not be used for
  normal program flow instead of
  conditional processing. It can also be
  difficult to maintain code that
  misuses exception handling in this
  way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I can't just switch this around at the client level. These users are very computer illiterate: and are very likely to freak out from seeing HTTPS "insecurity" errors (especially the way Firefox 3 and Internet Explorer 7 handle it nowadays: FULL STOP, kind of thankfully, but not helping me here LOL).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the rails side of things though, I'd actually suggest a virtual machine running linux.
Ubuntu works well, the only caveat is that you have to install &lt;code&gt;rubygems&lt;/code&gt; manually, as it does not adhere to the great debian filesystem naming ideology :-(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest this because if you want to do "advanced" things, such as installing ImageMagick/RMagick, or memcached, or a number of other plugins which require native C libraries, it becomes very painful very quickly if you're on windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second reason is that unless you are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; atypical, your production server will likely be running linux too. It's good practice to have your development environment match your deployment environment as closely as possible, to help you find and fix bugs earlier and more easily, and avoid fixing bugs that won't affect your production site (like windows specific ones)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Virtual PC and VMWare both have free options, which work well, and are plenty fast, so this is not a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a table that has a conditional visibility expression, and I need a page break at the end of the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I set the PageBreakAtEnd property to true. It is ignored no matter what. Remove the visibility condition and it works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I place the table inside a rectangle with the conditional visibility on the table, and the page break on the table. Same result. The page break property is ignored.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any other ideas on what to try? I'm almost at the point where I need a separate report rather than conditional visibility :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit: @Josh:&lt;/strong&gt; That has the same problems. If the second table has conditional visibility it doesn't work. If it doesn't have the visibility expression, then I get the page break all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@&lt;strong&gt;Erick:&lt;/strong&gt; I really wanted that to be the answer but unfortunately it doesn't work. When the visibility expression evaluates to hidden, there's a big gap where the rectangles would be (which I can live with), and when it evaluates to visible, the page breaks still don't work. &lt;/p&gt;

This seems to be by design though. Since I am using it for small objects this is not a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

 }

 };

 {
  SIZE_T allocLen = (_n * sizeof(_Ty));
  DWORD allocType = MEM_COMMIT;
  DWORD allocProtect = PAGE_READWRITE;
  LPVOID pMem = ::VirtualAlloc( NULL, allocLen, allocType, allocProtect );
  if ( pMem != NULL ) {
   ::VirtualLock( pMem, allocLen );
  }
  return reinterpret_cast&amp;lt;pointer&amp;gt;( pMem );
 }
 pointer allocate( size_type _n, const void* )
 {
  return allocate( _n );
 }

 void deallocate(void* _pPtr, size_type _n )
 {
  if ( _pPtr != NULL ) {
   SIZE_T allocLen = (_n * sizeof(_Ty));
   ::SecureZeroMemory( _pPtr, allocLen );
   ::VirtualUnlock( _pPtr, allocLen );
   ::VirtualFree( _pPtr, 0, MEM_RELEASE );
  }
 }
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Koan of Currying (A koan about food, that is not about food)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A student came to Jacques Garrigue and said, "I do not understand what currying is good for." Jacques replied, "Tell me your favorite meal and your favorite dessert". The puzzled student replied that he liked okonomiyaki and kanten, but while his favorite restaurant served great okonomiyaki, their kanten always gave him a stomach ache the following morning. So Jacques took the student to eat at a restaurant that served okonomiyaki every bit as good as the student's favorite, then took him across town to a shop that made excellent kanten where the student happily applied the remainder of his appetite. The student was sated, but he was not enlightened ... until the next morning when he woke up and his stomach felt fine. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My examples will cover using it for the reuse and encapsulation of code. This is fairly obvious once you look at these and should give you a concrete, simple example that you can think of applying in numerous situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to do a map over a tree. This function could be curried and applied to each node if it needs more then one argument -- since we'd be applying the one at the node as it's final argument. It doesn't have to be curried, but writing &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; function (assuming this function is being used in other instances with other variables) would be a waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;type 'a tree = E of 'a | N of 'a * 'a tree * 'a tree
let rec tree_map f tree = match tree with
    | N(x,left,right) -&amp;gt; N(f x, tree_map f left, tree_map f right)
    | E(x) -&amp;gt; E(f x)

let sample_tree = N(1,E(3),E(4)
let multiply x y = x * y
let sample_tree2 = tree_map (multiply 3) sample_tree
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but this is the same as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let sample_tree2 = tree_map (fun x -&amp;gt; x * 3) sample_tree
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this simple case isn't convincing. It really is though, and powerful once you use the language more and naturally come across these situations. The other example with some code reuse as currying. A &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7272/of-ways-to-count-the-limitless-primes#7487"&gt;recurrence relation to create prime numbers&lt;/a&gt;. Awful lot of similarity in there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let rec f_recurrence f a seed n =
    match n with
    | a -&amp;gt; seed
    | _ -&amp;gt; let prev = f_recurrence f a seed (n-1) in
           prev + (f n prev)

let rowland = f_recurrence gcd 1 7
let cloitre = f_recurrence lcm 1 1

let rowland_prime n = (rowland (n+1)) - (rowland n)
let cloitre_prime n = ((cloitre (n+1))/(cloitre n)) - 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, now rowland and cloitre are curried functions, since they have free variables, and we can get any index of it's sequence without knowing or worrying about f_recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;

Firstly, I should mention that I have personally found it easier to define and hook up commands in code rather than in XAML. It allows me to hook up the handlers for the commands a little more flexibly than an all XAML approach does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should work out what commands you want to have and what they relate to. In my application, I currently have a class for defining important application commands like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public static class CommandBank
{
  /// Command definition for Closing a window
  public static RoutedUICommand CloseWindow { get; private set; }

  /// Static private constructor, sets up all application wide commands.
  static CommandBank()
  {
    CloseWindow = new RoutedUICommand();
    CloseWindow.InputGestures.Add(new KeyGesture(Key.F4, ModifierKeys.Alt));
    // ...
  }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, because I wanted to keep the code all together, using a code only approach to Commands lets me put the following methods in the class above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/// Closes the window provided as a parameter
public static void CloseWindowExecute(object sender, ExecutedRoutedEventArgs e)
{
  ((Window)e.Parameter).Close();
}

/// Allows a Command to execute if the CommandParameter is not a null value
public static void CanExecuteIfParameterIsNotNull(object sender, CanExecuteRoutedEventArgs e)
{
  e.CanExecute = e.Parameter != null;
  e.Handled = true;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second method there can even be shared with other Commands without me having to repeat it all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have defined the commands like this, you can add them to any piece of UI. In the following, once the Window has Loaded, I add command bindings to both the Window and MenuItem and then add an input binding to the Window using a loop to do this for all command bindings. The parameter that is passed is the Window its self so the code above knows what Window to try and close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public partial class SimpleWindow : Window
{
  private void WindowLoaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
  {
    // ...
    this.CommandBindings.Add(
      new CommandBinding(
        CommandBank.CloseWindow,
        CommandBank.CloseWindowExecute,
        CommandBank.CanExecuteIfParameterIsNotNull));

    foreach (CommandBinding binding in this.CommandBindings)
    {
       RoutedCommand command = (RoutedCommand)binding.Command;
       if (command.InputGestures.Count &amp;gt; 0)
       {
         foreach (InputGesture gesture in command.InputGestures)
         {
           var iBind = new InputBinding(command, gesture);
           iBind.CommandParameter = this;
           this.InputBindings.Add(iBind);
         }
       }
    }

    // menuItemExit is defined in XAML
    menuItemExit.Command = CommandBank.CloseWindow;
    menuItemExit.CommandParameter = this;
    // ...
  }

  // ....
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then also later have event handlers for the WindowClosing and WindowClosed events, I do recommend you make the actual implementation of commands as small and generic as possible. As in this case, I didn't try to put code that tries to stop the Window closing if there is unsaved data, I kept that code firmly inside the WindowClosing event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you have any follow up questions. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;trivia questions: what tastes better, a toad or a popsicle?&lt;/li&gt;

Such collections are usually manipulated using bitwise operators, for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;myProperties.AllowedColors = MyColor.Red | MyColor.Green | MyColor.Blue;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;code&gt;[Flags]&lt;/code&gt; by itself doesn't change this &lt;strong&gt;at all&lt;/strong&gt; - all it does is enable a nice representation by the &lt;code&gt;.ToString()&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Flags] enum SuitsFlags { Spades = 1, Clubs = 2, Diamonds = 4, Hearts = 8 }
enum Suits { Spades = 1, Clubs = 2, Diamonds = 4, Hearts = 8 }

...

var str1 = (Suits.Spades | Suits.Diamonds).ToString();
           // "5"
var str2 = (SuitsFlags.Spades | SuitsFlags.Diamonds).ToString();
           // "Spades, Diamonds"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important to note that &lt;code&gt;[Flags]&lt;/code&gt; &lt;strong&gt;does not&lt;/strong&gt; automatically make the enum values powers of two. If you omit the numeric values, the enum will not work as one might expect in bitwise operations, because by default the values start with 0 and increment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incorrect declaration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Flags]
public enum MyColors
{
    Yellow,
    Green,
    Red,
    Blue
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The values, if declared this way, will be Yellow = 0, Green = 1, Red = 2, Blue = 3.  This will render it useless for use as flags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of a correct declaration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Flags]
public enum MyColors
{
    Yellow = 1,
    Green = 2,
    Red = 4,
    Blue = 8
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To retrieve the distinct values in you property one can do this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if((myProperties.AllowedColors &amp;amp; MyColor.Yellow) == MyColor.Yellow)
{
    // Yellow has been set...
}

if((myProperties.AllowedColors &amp;amp; MyColor.Green) == MyColor.Green)
{
    // Green has been set...
}    
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or, in .NET 4 and later,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (myProperties.AllowedColors.HasFlag(MyColor.Yellow))
{
    // Yellow has been set...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Under the covers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works because you previously used multiples of two in you enumeration. Under the covers your enumeration values looks like this (presented as bytes, which has 8 bits which can be 1's or 0's)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; Yellow: 00000001
 Green:  00000010
 Red:    00000100
 Blue:   00001000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, after you've set your property &lt;em&gt;AllowedColors&lt;/em&gt; to Red, Green and Blue (which values where OR'ed by the pipe |), &lt;em&gt;AllowedColors&lt;/em&gt; looks like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;myProperties.AllowedColors: 00001110
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when you retreive the value you are actually bitwise AND'ing the values&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;myProperties.AllowedColors: 00001110
             MyColor.Green: 00000010
             -----------------------
                            00000010 // Hey, this is the same as MyColor.Green!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The None = 0 value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And regarding use 0 in you enumeration, quoting from msdn:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Flags]
public enum MyColors
{
    None = 0,
    ....
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Use None as the name of the flag enumerated constant whose value is zero. &lt;strong&gt;You cannot use the None enumerated constant in a bitwise AND operation to test for a flag because the result is always zero.&lt;/strong&gt; However, you can perform a logical, not a bitwise, comparison between the numeric value and the None enumerated constant to determine whether any bits in the numeric value are set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find more info about the flags attribute and its usage at &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.flagsattribute.aspx"&gt;msdn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229062.aspx"&gt;designing flags at msdn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's going to be hard. As far as I am aware, you cannot disable Virtual Paging as it is handled by the OS. If there is a way, then you'll be spelunking in the bowels of the OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;* is incredibly hard to access through an attached debugger
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could run it through PGP and store it encrypted in memory and unencrypt it as needed. Massive performance hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The idea is that this will contain
  sensitive information (like licence
  information) which should be
  inaccessible to the user. I have done
  the usual research online and asked a
  few other people about this, but I
  cannot find a good place start on this
  problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep all sensitive information off the machine. Seriously. Don't store sensitive information in memory. Write a custom delete routine that will automatically remove all data from any allocations you perform. Never allow general access to a machine with sensitive material on it. If you perform db access, make sure all access is sanitized before firing. Only people with specific log-ins are allowed to access. No general group access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On a side note, what other methods are
  there of accessing the memory of a
  process other than attaching a
  debugger?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The advantage of this approach is that, for most people, &lt;strong&gt;the CAPTCHA won't ever be visible!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like this idea, is there not any way we can just hook into the rep system? I mean, anyone with say +100 rep is likely to be a human. So if they have rep, you need not even bother doing ANYTHING in terms of CAPTCHA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, if they are not, then send it, I'm sure it wont take that many posts to get to 100 and the community will instantly dive on anyone seem to be spamming with offensive tags, why not add a "report spam" link that downmods by 200? Get 3 of those, spambot achievement unlocked, bye bye ;)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I was really hoping that is was possible, and that I just hadn't found it yet. Your example just made me realise that that is exactly what we are trying to do - only allow access to files in the context of our program and so preserve the IP.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I guess I have to accept that there is no truly secure way to store someones files on another computer, especially if at some point access is allowed to that file by the owner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's definitely the problem.  You can store something securely so long as you never grant access, but as soon as you grant access, your control is gone.  You can make it a little bit more difficult, but that's all.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;What about a honeypot captcha?
    Wow, so simple! Looks good! Although they have highlighted the accessibility issue.. Do you think that this would be a problem at SO? I personally find it hard to imagine developers/programmers that have difficulty reading the screen to the point where they need a screen reader?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are developers who are not just legally blind, but 100% blind.  Walking cane and helper dog.  I hope the site will support them in a reasonable fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, with the honeypot captcha, you can put a hidden div as well that tells them to leave the field blank.  And you can also put it in the error message if they do fill it in, so I'm not sure how much of an issue accessibility really is here.  It's definitely not great, but it could be worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost.  The colo will obviously be more expensive than sticking a server in your parents' closet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quality.  The colo should be a lot more reliable than the server in your parents' closet.  They aren't as likely to go down when there's a power surge.  They should provide some support if things do go wrong on their end.  They will also likely give you better bandwidth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convenience.  It is a lot easier to fix a broken box when you can walk over to it and plug up a monitor.  Going to the colo to troubleshoot is probably not going to be convenient, if it's even possible.  Transferring files from your laptop to the server in the closet is also going to be a lot faster than transferring over the Internet.  On the other hand, if it's your box in the closet, you have to deal with the hardware problems, so it can balance out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I pay for a (shared) server.  I find that having someone else handle the server is worth it.  Uploading large files can get really frustrating, but having to maintain an extra box in the closet is too much hassle for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You really have to decide what you value most.  Is it worth the extra money to you to have a more reliable, more hands-off server?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Very simple arithmetic is good. Blind people will be able to answer. (But as Jarod said, beware of operator precedence.) I gather someone could write a parser, but it makes the spamming more costly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trivia is OK, but you'll have to write each of them :-(&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've seen pictures of animals [what is it?]. Votes for comics use a picture of a character with their name written somewhere in the image [type in name]. Impossible to parse, not ok for blind people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could have an audio fallback reading alphanumerics (the same letters and numbers you have in the captcha).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final line of defense: make spam easy to report (one click) and  easy to delete (one recap screen to check it's a spam account, with the last ten messages displayed, one click to delete account). This is still time-expensive, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to interact with controls on other forms. I am trying to access the controls by using, for example, the following...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;otherForm.Controls["nameOfControl"].Visible = false;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn't work the way I would expect. I end up with an exception thrown from &lt;code&gt;Main&lt;/code&gt;. However, if I make the controls &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt;, I can then access them directly, as so...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;otherForm.nameOfControl.Visible = false;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But is that the best way to do it? Is making the controls &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; on the other form considered "best practice"? Is there a "better" way to access controls on another form?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further Explanation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is actually a sort of follow-up to another question I asked, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3725/best-method-for-creating-a-tree-view-preferences-dialog-type-of-interface-in-c"&gt;Best method for creating a tree-view preferences dialog type of interface in C#?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The answer I got was great and solved many, many organizational problems I was having in terms of keeping the UI straight and easy to work with both in run-time and design-time. However, it did bring up this one niggling issue of easily controlling other aspects of the interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, I have a root form that instantiates a lot of other forms that sit in a panel on the root form. So, for instance, a radio button on one of those sub-forms might need to alter the state of a status strip icon on the main, root form. In that case, I need the sub-form to talk to the control in the status strip of the parent (root) form. (I hope that makes sense, not in a "who's on first" kind of way.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of coupling between forms always makes me nervous. I always try to keep the UI as light and &lt;em&gt;independent&lt;/em&gt; as possible..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps. Perhaps you could expand on the scenario if not?&lt;/p&gt;

An interface is a clean contract that a class should implement, and your usage of said classes &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be restricted to what is in the core Interface for this to work correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

Say you have several classes and UI's all of which had commands that were never disabled, you'd have to write a 'CanAlwaysExecute' method for each Window or UserControl! That's just not very &lt;em&gt;DRY&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having read several blogs and through trying several things, I've made the choice to make XAML purely about looks, styles, animation and triggers. All my hooking up of event handlers and commanding is now down in the code-behind. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another gotcha by the way is Input binding, in order for them to be caught, focus must be on the object that contains the Input bindings. For example, to have a short cut you can use at any time (say, F1 to open help), that input binding must be set on the Window object, since that always has focus when your app is Active. Using the code method should make that easier, even when you start using UserControls which might want to add input bindings to their parent Window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the differences between debug and release builds is how the function call stack frame is set up. There are certain classes of bad things you can do (like calling a function with the wrong number of arguments) that are not fatal in a debug build but crash horribly in a release build. Perhaps you could try changing the stack frame related options (I forget what they're called, sorry) in the release build to the same as the debug build and see whether that helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing might be to enable all the warnings you possibly can, and fix them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-html prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input type="hidden" name="antispam" value="lalalala" /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then have a piece of JavaScript which updates the value every second with the number of seconds the page has been loaded for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;var antiSpam = function() {
        if (document.getElementById("antiSpam")) {

                        a.value = 0;
                } else {
                        a.value = parseInt(a.value) + 1;

        }
        setTimeout("antiSpam()", 1000);
}

antiSpam();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then when the form is submitted, If the antispam value is still "lalalala", then I mark it as spam. If the antispam value is an integer, I check to see if it is above something like 10 (seconds). If it's below 10, I mark it as spam, if it's 10 or more, I let it through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-asp prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;If AntiSpam = A Integer
    If AntiSpam &amp;gt;= 10
        Comment = Approved
    Else
        Comment = Spam
Else
    Comment = Spam
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theory being that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A spam bot will not support JavaScript and will submit what it sees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the bot does support JavaScript it will submit the form instantly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The commenter has at least read some of the page before posting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside to this method is that it requires JavaScript, and if you don't have JavaScript enabled, your comment will be marked as spam, however, I do review comments marked as spam, so this is not a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response to comments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@MrAnalogy: The server side approach sounds quite a good idea and is exactly the same as doing it in JavaScript. Good Call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moose gives you (among other things) a constructor, accessor methods, and type checking for free! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in your code you can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $p = Point-&amp;gt;new({x=&amp;gt;10 , y=&amp;gt;20}); # Free constructor
$p-&amp;gt;x(15);     # Free setter
print $p-&amp;gt;x(); # Free getter
$p-&amp;gt;clear();
$p-&amp;gt;x(15.5);   # FAILS! Free type check.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good starting point is &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moose::Manual"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Moose::Manual&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moose::Cookbook"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Moose::Cookbook&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Here's a simplified example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;       date   name   earnings   source          location

12-AUG-2008   Tom      $50.00   washing cars    uptown

12-AUG-2008   Harry    $75.00   mowing lawns    around town

                    total earnings for washing cars: $150.00 { subreport }
                    total earnings for mowing lawns:  $75.00

       date   name   earnings   source          location
-----------------------------------------------------------
13-AUG-2008   John     $95.00   dog walking     downtown
13-AUG-2008   Jane    $105.00   washing cars    around town  { main report }
13-AUG-2008   Dave     $65.00   mowing lawns    around town

                    total earnings for dog walking:   $95.00
                    total earnings for washing cars: $105.00 { subreport }
                    total earnings for mowing lawns:  $65.00
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, the main report is grouped by 'date', but the totals are grouped additionally by 'source'. I've looked up examples of using running totals, but they don't really do what I need. Isn't there some way of storing the result set and having both the main report and the subreport reference the same data?&lt;/p&gt;

You then convert to the relative time periods. So, for example, by default, if you were showing a calendar, you'd work from todays date. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int strtotime  ( string $time  [, int $now  ] )
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see in the function definition here of strtotime, the second argument is now, i.e. you can change the date from which it's relative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might be easier to display through a quick loop&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will loop through the last 10 days using "yesterday" as the first argument. We then use date to print it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$time = time();

for ($i = 0; $i &amp;lt; 10; $i++) {
    $time = strtotime("yesterday", $time);
    print date("r", $time) . "\n";
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So pass the time/date in via the URI so you can save the relative date. &lt;/p&gt;

For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    private Color blah = Color.Black;
    public Color Blah
    {
        get { return this.blah; }

&lt;p&gt;This shows up for the control, but it's in the "Misc" category and has no description or default value.  I've tried using the settings in System.ComponentModel like "DesignerCategory", such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[DesignerCategory("Custom")]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But says this is only valid for class declarations... could've sworn it was the System.ComponentModel items I used before...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@John said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;DesignerCatogy is used to say if the
  class is a form, component etc.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;[Category("Custom")]&lt;/p&gt;

I've tried those exactly and the compiler doesn't recognize them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In .NETCF all I seem to have available from System.ComponentModel is:&lt;/p&gt;

   DesignerCategory,
   DesignTimeVisible,
   EditorBrowsable

&lt;p&gt;For full windows the attribute you want is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[System.ComponentModel.Category("Custom")]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and for the description you can use [System.ComponentModel.Description("This is the description")] &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to use both together&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[System.ComponentModel.Category("Custom"),System.ComponentModel.Description("This is the description")]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However this is part of system.dll which may be different for windows mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

For native exceptions, overriding &lt;code&gt;CWinApp::ProcessWndProcException&lt;/code&gt; works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two events suggested in Jeff's &lt;a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/exception/ExceptionHandling.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;CodeProject article&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Application.ThreadException&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException&lt;/code&gt;, are not raised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can anyone suggest a way to provide a final managed exception handler for a mixed executable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that these exception handlers are only triggered downstream of &lt;code&gt;Application.Run&lt;/code&gt; or similar (there's a worker thread flavor, can't remember the name.) If you want to truly globally catch a managed exception you do need to install an SEH filter. You're not going to get a &lt;code&gt;System.Exception&lt;/code&gt; and if you want a callstack you're going to have to roll your own walker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an MSDN forum question on this topic it was suggested to override a sufficiently low-level point of the main MFC thread in a &lt;code&gt;try ... catch (Exception^)&lt;/code&gt;.  For instance, &lt;code&gt;CWinApp::Run&lt;/code&gt;.  This may be a good solution but I haven't looked at any perf or stability implications.  You'll get a chance to log with a call stack before you bail and you can avoid the default windows unahndled exception behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now with .Net 3.5 I'm not at all sure.  Try decompiling a 3.5 assembly; what you get is a long long way from compiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the optimisations from 3.5 (far better than 1.1) and the way anonymous types, delegates and so on are handled by reflection (they are a nightmare to recompile). Add lambda expressions, compiler 'magic' like Linq-syntax and &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt;, and C#2 functions like &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; (which results in new classes with unreadable names). Your decompiled code ends up a long long way from compilable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A professional team with lots of time could still reverse engineer it back again, but then the same is true of any obfuscated code. What code they got out of that would be unmaintainable and highly likely to be very buggy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, assuming an easy BPM (beats per minute) of 120, the timer should tick every .5 seconds (or 500 milliseconds).  Using this as the basis for the ticks, however, isn't entirely accurate as .NET only guarantees that your timer will not tick before the elapsed time has passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, to get around this for the same 120 BPM example used above, I am setting the ticks to something like 100 milliseconds and only playing the click sound on every 5th timer tick.  This does improve the accuracy quite a bit, but if feels like a bit of a hack.&lt;/p&gt;

I highly recommend acquiring some background Win32 knowledge (e.g. &lt;a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/pw5/index.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Petzold&lt;/a&gt;) as the WinForms framework lives on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;

The GPL family of licenses allows for exceptions regarding library usage, but this won't apply to this since by necessity, the kind of framework I would need to use would be all source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise I'd strongly advise that you look at a scripting-based solution, because development in these, once you're up to speed, is so much faster. And a lot more fun, if we're honest, for most people at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the per-record processing load is not high, you may be surprised how little performance you lose: file IO will almost certainly be handled in a compiled (C) library, so the interpreter overhead may be relatively low. Worth trying, I'd suggest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the imperative languages, Perl is an obvious option, Python is popular and Ruby has a high profile (and probably cleaner OO features than the first two). Then there is the slightly more, er, esoteric realm of the functional languages, but I'm not qualified to comment on those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code you've shown shouldn't convince anyone to use Hashtable instead of Dictionary, since both code pieces can be used for both types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For hashtable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;foreach(object key in h.keys)
{
     string keyAsString = key.ToString(); // btw, this is unnecessary
     string valAsString = h[key].ToString();

     System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(keyAsString + " " + valAsString);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For dictionary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;foreach(string key in d.keys)
{
     string valAsString = d[key].ToString();

     System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(key + " " + valAsString);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just the same for the other one with KeyValuePair, just use the non-generic version for Hashtable, and the generic version for Dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it's just as easy both ways, but Hashtable uses Object for both key and value, which means you will box all value types, and you don't have type safety, and Dictionary uses generic types and is thus better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm currently developing a site using ColdFusion and have a mod_rewrite rule in place to make it look like the site is using PHP. Any requests for index.php get processed by index.cfm (the rule maps *.php to *.cfm).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works great - so far, so good. The problem is that I want to return a 404 status code if index.cfm (or any ColdFusion page) is requested directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I try to block access to *.cfm files using mod_rewrite it also returns a 404 for requests to *.php.&lt;/p&gt;

You'll need a spare machine  though, and a switch that can do port mirroring.
If you have those then an IDS is a cheap way of monitoring your traffic for many intrusion attempts (there will be lots). Snort (www.snort.org) based IDSes are excellent, and there are some free fully packaged versions available. One I have used is StrataGuard (&lt;a href="http://sgfree.stillsecure.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://sgfree.stillsecure.com/&lt;/a&gt;), and it can be configured as an IDS (Intrusion Detection System) or as an IPS (Intrusion Prevention System). It's free to use if your traffic does not exceed 5Mbps.
If you do go with an IDS/IPS I'd advise you to let it run as a simple IDS for a month or so, before you allow it to prevent attacks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may be overkill, but if you have a spare machine lying around it can't hurt to have an IDS running passively.&lt;/p&gt;

I wouldnt' spend a lot of time on this though and you don't necessarily need to do this first if you are going to chose WPF.  I just think it's good to have a basic understanding of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as getting ready for the future you need to learn WPF, but it isn't complete yet, so depending on the kinds of client side apps you want to create, you will probably need to learn WinForms.  The majority of people aren't using WPF yet, so it's a good time to start learning.  I think you will find it easier using C# to learn it instead of doing managed code with C++. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my Delphi apps, I frequently use TFrames and parent them to the main form, and maximizing them so they take up the client area. This gives you something similar to how Outlook looks. It goes a little something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;TMyForm = class(TForm)
private
  FCurrentModule : TFrame;
public
  property CurrentModule : TFrame read FModule write SetCurrentModule;
end;

procedure TMyForm.SetCurrentModule(ACurrentModule : TFrame);
begin
  if assigned(FCurrentModule) then
    FreeAndNil(FCurrentModule);  // You could cache this if you wanted
  FCurrentModule := ACurrentModule;
  if assigned(FCurrentModule) then
  begin
    FCurrentModule.Parent := Self;
    FCurrentModule.Align := alClient;
  end;
end;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use it, you can simply do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;MyForm.CurrentModule := TSomeFrame.Create(nil);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a good argument that you should use interfaces (creating an IModule interface or something) that you use. I often do that, but it's more complex than needed to explain the concept here.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The previous chapters discussed how to

  the functionality of Python by
  attaching a library of C functions to
  it. It is also possible to do it the
  other way around: enrich your C/C++
  application by embedding Python in it.
  Embedding provides your application
  with the ability to implement some of
  the functionality of your application
  in Python rather than C or C++. This
  can be used for many purposes; one
  example would be to allow users to
  tailor the application to their needs
  by writing some scripts in Python. You
  can also use it yourself if some of
  the functionality can be written in
  Python more easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm setting up a new hosting solution and would much prefer to run a 64bit OS, and since it's an ASP.Net MVC solution with SQL Server DB, the OS is either going to be Windows Server 2003 or (hopfully!) 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that this could spill over into a debate regarding 32bit vs 64bit on servers, but let's just say that my preference is 64bit and that I have some &lt;a href="http://blogs.technet.com/mscom/archive/2005/09/26/411568.aspx"&gt;very&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000435.html"&gt;good&lt;/a&gt; reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I've tried a number of options and found a &lt;a href="http://blog.rakeshxp.com/2007/09/running-memcached-on-windows.html"&gt;bit&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.splinedancer.com/memcached-win32/"&gt;help&lt;/a&gt; related to getting this up on a 32bit machine (and succeeded I might add), but since the original &lt;a href="http://jehiah.cz/projects/memcached-win32/"&gt;Windows port&lt;/a&gt; is Win32 specific, this is hardly going to help when installing as a service on x64. It also has a dependency on the &lt;a href="http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/"&gt;libevent&lt;/a&gt; for which I can only get a Win32 compiled version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect that simply loading all this up in C++ and hitting "compile" (for 64bit) wouldn't work, not least because of the intricate differences in 32 and 64bit architectures, but I'm wondering if anyone is workng on getting this off the ground? Unfortunately, my expertise lie in managed code (C#) only, otherwise I would try and take this on myself, but I can't believe I'm the only guy out there trying to get &lt;a href="http://www.danga.com/memcached/"&gt;memcached&lt;/a&gt; running on a 64 bit Windows server....am I??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any help or recommendations appreciated...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes I'm afraid I'm still looking for an answer to this - all my efforts (with my pathetic C++ skills) to make a stable build have failed - I've trashed one server and 3 VM's just trying it out so now I turn to the real experts.
Is anyone planning on porting this to 64bit? Or are you really suggesting that I use MS Velocity instead? I shudder at the thought...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update:
@Lars - I do use Enyim actually - it's very good, but what you're referring to is a client, rather than the server part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@DannySmurf - I've only been able to install it as a service on a 32 bit OS. 64 bit OS rejects the installation of this Win32 service. Of course yes, lots of Win32 code works seamlessly on x64 architecture, hence you can run 32bit apps (like Office for instance) or games on Vista/XP 64 etc, but this doesn't translate directly when it comes to services. I'm no expert, I suspect that it has to do with the syncs or eventing that services need to subscribe to, and I suspect that 64 and 32 don't play nicely. I'm happy to be corrected on any of this, but to answer your question - yes I have tried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@OJ - thanks very much for the straight-forward response. I thought as much, but wasn't sure if anyone else had suggestions or had already gone down this route. Maybe when StackOverflow is LIVE, then more people will respond and let me know if this is something being looked into, and although I can try and compile it myself - I simply can't "trust" (with my C++ experience level) that it would provide "Enterprise Level" reliability in such a crucial component of large scalable solutions. I think it would need educated intervention rather than my unsanitised experimental approach before I could be confident. One little oversight on my part, could bring the site down. Oh well....till next time... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

Do you ever manipulate XML? Do you ever automate anything? Simple example.  Someone gives you a comma delimited file and you need to pull some fields out of it to import into some other tool/database or to create some list for your program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the csv has the field names in the first line of the file, you can do the following in Powershell:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$Data = import-csv "something.csv"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can then refer to your data using the field names.  If you had a field called SSN then you could say $Data[n].SSN.  You could also just pipe the import-csv command to something that processed the data including exporting it as XML/html or anything you want with just a few commands.  Powershell is full of stuff like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a tool that gives you tremendous access to a ton of stuff on your workstation and servers, including the complete .NET library.  It's a tool that isn't targeted at a type of person.

&lt;p&gt;I have a flash applet that needs to maintain a TCP connection to a server. I have implemented timeouts using Timers, a ping-pong system, etc. However, there's a problem. Upon calling Socket.connect(), the flash player (9.0.115 and many other stables before that) sends 3 connection requests by way of SYN packets, with some time in between. If none of those are replied to (e.g. because the server is down), I cannot get the applet to [attempt to] connect to the server. Ever. That is, within the lifetime of the applet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clarify and/or summarize:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any host/port pair given to Socket.connect() or XMLSocket.connect(), if the call fails, any subsequent connect() calls to any other Socket (or XMLSocket) instances &lt;strong&gt;within the lifetime of the Flash applet&lt;/strong&gt; to the same host/port pair get ignored. (At least as far as I can tell using a packet sniffer.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried calling numerous Socket methods, destroying and recreating the objects, using a pool of Sockets, and various other methods I can't remember right now; all to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current solution is to notify the parent webpage through a JavaScript call and let it reload my applet. It's not a pretty solution, and I'm not about to implement workarounds for the problems &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; causes, just because Flash can't handle socket connections properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must be missing something very simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1: I know you can't really destroy objects; I just remove all references to them and hope for the best. I haven't tried to explicitly invoke the GC in this case. (Though I think I did try putting the Socket inside an Array and using &lt;em&gt;delete&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it works as expected if the connection is successful (even if the connection drops later on.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only event to trigger this is the case when the server doesn't respond at all; it's as if Flash marks the host/port combination as "offline" and doesn't bother sending any more packets to it for the lifetime of the applet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect an active refusal of the connection (e.g. host is online but not listening to the port) doesn't cause this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get no error message or feedback of any other kind from the Socket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever called connect() more than once to the same host/port pair, when the first one failed?
How did you know the first connect() failed? And before subsequent connect() calls, did you do anything to reset the socket?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I know you can limit the generic type parameter to a type or interface implementation via the &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; clause. However, this doesn't fit the bill for primitives (AFAIK) because they do not all have a common ground (apart from &lt;em&gt;object&lt;/em&gt; before someone says! :P).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 1:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to clarify:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code definition should be like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class MyClass&amp;lt;GenericType&amp;gt; ....
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And instantiation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;MyClass&amp;lt;bool&amp;gt; = new MyClass&amp;lt;bool&amp;gt;(); // Legal
MyClass&amp;lt;string&amp;gt; = new MyClass&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;(); // Legal
MyClass&amp;lt;DataSet&amp;gt; = new MyClass&amp;lt;DataSet&amp;gt;(); // Illegal
MyClass&amp;lt;RobsFunkyHat&amp;gt; = new MyClass&amp;lt;RobsFunkyHat&amp;gt;(); // Illegal (but looks awesome!)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 2&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Jon Limjap - Good point, and something I was already considering.. I'm sure there is a generic method that can be used to determine if the type is of a value or reference type..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be useful in instantly removing a lot of the objects I dont want to deal with (but then you need to worry about the structs that are used such as &lt;em&gt;Size&lt;/em&gt; ).. Interesting problem no? :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;where T : struct
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken from &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/d5x73970.aspx"&gt;MSDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm curious.. Could this be done in .NET 3.x using extension methods? Create an interface, and implement the interface in the extension methods (which would probably be cleaner than a bit fat switch). Plus if you then need to later extend to any lightweight custom types, they can also implement the same interface, with no changes required to the base code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you guys think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sad news is I am working in Framework 2!! :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 3&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was so simple following on from &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8941/generic-type-checking#8956"&gt;Jon Limjaps Pointer&lt;/a&gt;.. So simple I almost want to cry, but it's great because the code works like a charm!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here is what I did (you'll laugh!):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Code added to the generic class&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;bool TypeValid()
{
    // Get the TypeCode from the Primitive Type
    TypeCode code = Type.GetTypeCode(typeof(PrimitiveDataType));

    // All of the TypeCode Enumeration refer Primitive Types
    // with the exception of Object and Empty (Null).
    // Since I am willing to allow Null Types (at this time)
    // all we need to check for is Object!
    switch (code)
    {
        case TypeCode.Object:
            return false;
        default:
            return true;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then a little utility method to check the type and throw an exception,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;private void EnforcePrimitiveType()
{
    if (!TypeValid())
        throw new InvalidOperationException(
            "Unable to Instantiate SimpleMetadata based on the Generic Type of '" + typeof(PrimitiveDataType).Name + 
            "' - this Class is Designed to Work with Primitive Data Types Only.");
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that then needs to be done is to call &lt;em&gt;EnforcePrimitiveType()&lt;/em&gt; in the classes constructors.. Job done! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only one downside, it only throws an exception at runtime (obviously) rather than design time.. But that's no big deal and could be picked up with utilities like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FxCop"&gt;FxCop&lt;/a&gt; (which we don't use at work).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to Jon Limjap on this one!&lt;/p&gt;

}

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3748/storing-images-in-db-yea-or-nay#3756"&gt;Storing Images in DB - Yea or Nay?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, the space and performance hit can be quite big, depending on the number of users. Also, keep in mind that Web servers are cheap and you can easily add more to balance the load, whereas the database is the most expensive and hardest to scale part of a web architecture usually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some opposite examples (e.g., Microsoft Sharepoint), but usually, storing files in the database is not a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless possibly you write desktop apps and/or know roughly how many users you will ever have, but on something as random and unexpectable like a public web site,  you may pay a high price for storing files in the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;($condition ? $a= 2 : $a ) = 3 ;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the ?: operator  produces an assignable result, 3 is assigned to the result of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$a = ( $condition ? 2 : 3 );

I disagree wholeheartedly that PowerShell is not a dev's tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a .NET based product, it is a direct analogue to .NET programming. Whole .NET programs can be prototyped in PS, as well as little oneliners to test functionality of methods...etc. That the language architects for PS specifically designed PS's syntax to be close to C#, means there is very little context switch when writing PS scripts and C# code(something I had to do alot recently). You're building on your knowledge already hard won with .NET languages, using PS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an automation tool, it is superb. It access's WMI, ADO, ADSI, .NET, COM natively, plus can be spot-welded to work with anything else. This alone makes any Windows automation easier and more powerful. The amount of access to the system is paralled by some other langauges (VBscript, Python) but the ease of use of the language and the benefit of the .NET framework means that some PS scripting is tying together existing code (code reuse) instead of wasting your time writing yet another file zipping routine (for example...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are already projects out there that are making build tools (psake comes to mind) to make dev's life easier. Projects like Powershell Community Extensions show the powerful extension capabilities normal every-day devs can achieve. I agree with some of the posters above, I consider anything done to setup build envrionments or work with data for dev tasks, can be done with PS, if not faster/easier/better, but just as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: kokos, thanks for pointing out the ?? operator, that's indeed really useful. Since it's a bit hard to google for it (as ?? is just ignored), here is the MSDN documentation page for that operator: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173224.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;??

&lt;p&gt;Sybase, sadly, is a whole 'nother database these days, since about 1997, in fact, give or take a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the input format simply has to be 'DD-MON-YYYY' and no exceptions, then I think a fair amount of validation was be achieved by slicing the input using SUBSTR(), after first doing some simple things, such as checking length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought that recent releases of Sybase (SQL Anywhere 11, for example) have regular expression support, however, although it's been a while since I've had to suffer T-SQL. Some googling leaves me in rather more doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update:  I remember now it had to do with the fact that I had Visual Studio Tools for Office already installed.  When I upgraded my computer I did a clean install of everything without problems by installing VS 2008 before installing Office 2007 and VSTO.  So most likely you have to uninstall whatever is causing VS 2008 to want to go to a specific drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this doesn't work because the @Test annotation will try to make a bunch of methods into tests, and warnings/errors pop up in eclipse when the tests are run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I tried disabling the test, so at least the groups are assigned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;@Test(enabled = false, groups = { "db-test" })
public class DBTestBase {

&lt;p&gt;but then any @BeforeTest (and other similar annotations) ALSO get disabled... which is of course not what I want.&lt;/p&gt;

They may be used to group methods but this must be handled with extreme caution so that the reader of the code does not go insane. There is no point in folding methods by their modifiers. But sometimes folding may increase readability. For e.g. grouping some methods that you use for working around some issues when using an external library and you won't want to visit too often may be helpful. But the coder must always seek for solutions like wrapping the library with appropriate classes in this particular example. When all else fails, use folding for improving readibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;MyClass c;
  if (obj is MyClass)
    c = obj as MyClass
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're going to use 'is', why follow it up with a safe cast using 'as'? If you've ascertained that obj is indeed MyClass, a bog-standard cast:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;c = (MyClass)obj
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...is never going to fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, you could just say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;MyClass c = obj as MyClass;
if(c != null)
{
   ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know enough about .NET's innards to be sure, but my instincts tell me that this would cut a maximum of two type casts operations down to a maximum of one. It's hardly likely to break the processing bank either way; personally, I think the latter form looks cleaner too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh-keygen
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then go through the steps, you'll have two files, &lt;code&gt;id_rsa&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;id_rsa.pub&lt;/code&gt; (the first is your private key, the second is your public key - the one you copy to remote machines)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, connect to the remote machine you want to login to, to the file &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt; add the contents of your that &lt;code&gt;id_rsa.pub&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and &lt;code&gt;chmod 600&lt;/code&gt; all the &lt;code&gt;id_rsa*&lt;/code&gt; files (both locally and remote), so no other users can read them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa*
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, ensure the remote &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt; file is &lt;code&gt;chmod 600&lt;/code&gt; also:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, when you do &lt;code&gt;ssh remote.machine&lt;/code&gt;, it should ask you for the key's password, not the remote machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make it nicer to use, you can use &lt;code&gt;ssh-agent&lt;/code&gt; to hold the decrypted keys in memory - this means you don't have to type your keypair's password every single time. To launch the agent, you run (including the back-tick quotes, which eval the output of the &lt;code&gt;ssh-agent&lt;/code&gt; command)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;`ssh-agent`
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On some distros, ssh-agent is started automatically. If you run &lt;code&gt;echo $SSH_AUTH_SOCK&lt;/code&gt; and it shows a path (probably in /tmp/) it's already setup, so you can skip the previous command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then to add your key, you do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and enter your passphrase. It's stored until you remove it (using the &lt;code&gt;ssh-add -D&lt;/code&gt; command, which removes all keys from the agent)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use flags you can add an extension method to enums to make checking the contained flags easier (see post for detail)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows you to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Flags]
public enum PossibleOptions : byte
{
    None = 0,
    OptionOne = 1,
    OptionTwo = 2,
    OptionThree = 4,
    OptionFour = 8,

    //combinations can be in the enum too
    OptionOneAndTwo = OptionOne | OptionTwo,
    OptionOneTwoAndThree = OptionOne | OptionTwo | OptionThree,
    ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you can do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;PossibleOptions opt = PossibleOptions.OptionOneTwoAndThree 

if( opt.IsSet( PossibleOptions.OptionOne ) ) {
    //optionOne is one of those set
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find this easier to read than the most ways of checking the included flags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are undocumented C# keywords (even Visual Studio recognizes them!) that were added to for a more efficient boxing/unboxing prior to generics. They work in coordination with the System.TypedReference struct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's also __arglist, which is used for variable length parameter lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing folks don't know much about is &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms404247.aspx"&gt;System.WeakReference&lt;/a&gt; -- a very useful class that keeps track of an object but still allows the garbage collector to collect it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most useful "hidden" feature would be the yield return keyword. It's not really hidden, but a lot of folks don't know about it. LINQ is built atop this; it allows for delay-executed queries by generating a state machine under the hood. Raymond Chen recently posted about the &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/08/12/8849519.aspx"&gt;internal, gritty details&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Is there any option besides using the hidden iframe trick?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, no, not now. Otherwise the microsummary code you point to would use it instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And if not, what is the best way to do the iframe trick so that your code works outside the context of any currently open tabs (so that closing tabs won't screw up code, etc)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code you quoted uses the recent browser window, so closing tabs won't affect parsing. Closing that browser window will abort your load, but you can deal with it (detect that the load is aborted and restart it in another window for example) and it doesn't happen very often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need a DOM window for the iframe to work properly, so there's no clean solution at the moment (if you're keen on using the mozilla parser).&lt;/p&gt;

Now it doesn't, but the compiler won't let me build the project without the assembly reference in place. Let me elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project used to throw and catch a custom exception class - the &lt;code&gt;SuperException&lt;/code&gt; - which was derived from the standard System.Exception and lived in a separate, precompiled assembly, &lt;code&gt;SuperAssembly.DLL&lt;/code&gt;, which I referenced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I decided this was a pointless exercise and replaced all &lt;code&gt;SuperExceptions&lt;/code&gt; with a System.SuitableStandardException in each case. I removed the reference to &lt;code&gt;SuperException.DLL&lt;/code&gt;, but am now met with the following on trying to compile the project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The type 'SuperException' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'SuperException, Version=1.1.0.0 (...)'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source file referenced by the error doesn't seem relevant; it's the project namespace that gets highlighted in the IDE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, here's the thing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All uses of &lt;code&gt;SuperException&lt;/code&gt; have been eliminated from the project's code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compared to another project that compiles fine without a reference to &lt;code&gt;SuperException.DLL&lt;/code&gt;, I only reference one more assembly - and &lt;code&gt;that&lt;/code&gt; references nothing that my project doesn't reference itself. While it's possible that any of these dependencies could throw &lt;code&gt;SuperExceptions&lt;/code&gt;, I'm only catching the base Exception class and in any case... the other project builds fine!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've done Visual Studio's "Clean Solution" and cleared everything out by hand, many times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not the end of the world to include this reference, I just don't see why it's necessary any more. Nrrrgg. Any pointers welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have two large files which we'd like to read from two separate threads concurrently.  One thread will sequentially read fileA while the other thread will sequentially read fileB.  There is no locking or communication between the threads, both are sequentially reading as fast as they can, and both are immediately discarding the data they read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our experience with this setup on Windows is very poor.  The combined throughput of the two threads is in the order of 2-3 MiB/sec.  The drive seems to be spending most of its time seeking backwards and forwards between the two files, presumably reading very little after each seek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we disable one of the threads and temporarily look at the performance of a single thread then we get much better bandwidth (~45 MiB/sec for this machine).  So clearly the bad two-thread performance is an artefact of the OS disk scheduler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything we can do to improve the concurrent thread read performance?&lt;/strong&gt;  Perhaps by using different APIs or by tweaking the OS disk scheduler parameters in some way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The files are in the order of 2 GiB each on a machine with 2GiB of RAM.  For the purpose of this question we consider them not to be cached and perfectly defragmented.  We have used defrag tools and rebooted to ensure this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are using no special APIs to read these files.  The behaviour is repeatable across various bog-standard APIs such as Win32's CreateFile, C's fopen, C++'s std::ifstream, Java's FileInputStream, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each thread spins in a loop making calls to the read function.  We have varied the number of bytes requested from the API each iteration from values between 1KiB up to 128MiB.  Varying this has had no effect, so clearly the amount the OS is physically reading after each disk seek is not dictated by this number.  This is exactly what should be expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dramatic difference between one-thread and two-thread performance is repeatable across Windows 2000, Windows XP (32-bit and 64-bit), Windows Server 2003, and also with and without hardware RAID5.&lt;/p&gt;

All other non-Microsoft operating systems we have tested do not suffer from this problem.  Linux, FreeBSD, and Mac OS X (this final one on different hardware) all degrade much more gracefully in terms of aggregate bandwidth when moving from one thread to two.  Linux for example degraded from ~45 MiB/sec to ~42 MiB/sec.  These other operating systems must be reading larger chunks of the file between each seek, and therefor not spending nearly all their time waiting on the disk to seek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our solution for Windows is to pass the FILE&lt;em&gt;FLAG&lt;/em&gt;NO_BUFFERING flag to CreateFile and use large (~16MiB) reads in each call to ReadFile.  This is suboptimal for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Files don't get cached when read like this, so there are none of the advantages that caching normally gives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The constraints when working with this flag are much more complicated than normal reading (alignment of read buffers to page boundaries, etc).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(As a final remark.  Does this explain why swapping under Windows is so hellish?  Ie, Windows is incapable of doing IO to multiple files concurrently with any efficiency, so while swapping all other IO operations are forced to be disproportionately slow.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit to add some further details for Will Dean:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course across these different hardware configurations the raw figures did change (sometimes substantially).  The problem however is the consistent degradation in performance that only Windows suffers when moving from one thread to two.  Here is a summary of the machines tested:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several Dell workstations (Intel Xeon) of various ages running Windows 2000, Windows XP (32-bit), and Windows XP (64-bit) with single drive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Dell 1U server (Intel Xeon) running Windows Server 2003 (64-bit) with RAID 1+0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An HP workstation (AMD Opteron) with Windows XP (64-bit), and Windows Server 2003, and hardware RAID 5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My home unbranded PC (AMD Athlon64) running Windows XP (32-bit), FreeBSD (64-bit), and Linux (64-bit) with single drive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My home MacBook (Intel Core1) running Mac OS X, single SATA drive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My home &lt;a href="http://koolu.com/Koolu-WE-Appliance/Works-Everywhere-Appliance.html" rel="nofollow" title="Donald Ervin Knuth"&gt;Koolu&lt;/a&gt; PC running Linux. Vastly underpowered compared to the other systems but I demonstrated that even this machine can outperform a Windows server with RAID5 when doing multi-threaded disk reads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CPU usage on all of these systems was very low during the tests and anti-virus was disabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I forgot to mention before but we also tried the normal Win32 CreateFile API with the FILE&lt;em&gt;FLAG&lt;/em&gt;SEQUENTIAL_SCAN flag set.  This flag didn't fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

It was such a huge pain that I ended up writing a Win32 frontend instead. From the top of my head, I encountered the following problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development of the ODBC link seems to have ceased long ago. There are various different versions floating around --- very confusing. The ODBC link doesn't support Unicode/UTF8, and I remember there were other issues with it as well (though some could be overcome by careful configuration).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You probably want to manually tweak your db schema to make it compatible with MS Access. I see you already found out about the needed surrogate keys (i.e., int primary keys) :-)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should keep in mind that you may need to use pass-through queries to do more sophisticated SQL manipulations of the MySQL database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be careful with using lots of VBA, as that tends to corrupt your frontend file. Regularly compressing the database (using main menu, Tools | Database utilities | Compress and restore, or something like that --- I'm using the Dutch version) and making &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of backups is necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access tends to cause lots of network traffic. Like, really huge lots. I haven't been able to find a solution for that. Using a network monitor is recommended if you want to keep an eye on that!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access insists on storing booleans as 0/-1. IMHO, 0/+1 makes more sense, and I believe it is the default way of doing things in MySQL as well. Not a huge problem, but if your checkboxes don't work, you should definitely check this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possible alternative would be to put the backend (with the data) on a shared drive. I remember this is well-documented, also in the help. You may want to have a look at &lt;a href="http://allenbrowne.com/ser-01.html"&gt;some general advice on splitting into a frontend and a backend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://allenbrowne.com/ser-13.html"&gt;code that automatically reconnects to the backend on startup&lt;/a&gt;; I can also send you some more sample code, or post it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, you might also want to consider MS SQL. I don't have experience with that, but I presume it works together with MS Access much more nicely!&lt;/p&gt;

In my experience, there are two key things that can help keep your personal server secure enough to throw up on the internet while retaining your sanity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Security through obscurity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, relying on this in the 'real world' is a bad idea and not to be entertained. But that's because in the real world,  baddies know what's there and that there's loot to be had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a personal server, the majority of 'attacks' you'll suffer will simply be automated sweeps from machines that have already been compromised, looking for default installations of products known to be vulnerable. If your server doesn't offer up anything enticing on the default ports or in the default locations, the automated attacker will move on. Therefore, if you're going to run a ssh server, put it on a non-standard port (&gt;1024) and it's likely it will never be found. If you can get away with this technique for your web server then great, shift that to an obscure port too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Package management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't compile and install Apache or sshd from source yourself unless you absolutely have to. If you do, you're taking on the responsibility of keeping up-to-date with the latest security patches. Let the nice package maintainers from Linux distros such as Debian or Ubuntu do the work for you. Install from the distro's precompiled packages, and staying current becomes a matter of issuing the occasional &lt;em&gt;apt-get update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt-get -u dist-upgrade&lt;/em&gt; command, or using whatever fancy GUI tool Ubuntu provides.&lt;/p&gt;

In your business logic layer you have described your business objects: getters, setters, accessors, and so on... you get the idea. The interface to the business logic layer guarantees safe usage of the business logic, so all the methods and accessors you call will validate input. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This great when you first write the UI code, because you have a neatly defined interface that you can trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here comes the tricky part, when you start writing the data access layer, the interface to the business logic does not accommodate your needs. You need to have more accessors and getters to set fields which are/used to be hidden. Now you are forced to erode the interface of your business logic; now it is possible set fields from the UI layer, which the UI layer has no business setting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the changes needed for the data access layer, the interface to the business logic has eroded to the point where it is possible to even set the business logic with invalid data. Thus, the interface does not guarantee safe usage anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I explained the problem clearly enough. How do you prevent interface eroding, maintain information hiding and encapsulation, and yet still accommodate different interface needs among different layers? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A lot of concrete Interfaces, like an IPersonRepository, that inherits from IReadRepository, you get the point..&lt;br /&gt;
Anything you cannot describe with just the smaller interfaces, you put into the concrete interface.&lt;br /&gt;
As long as you use the IPersonRepository to declare your object, you get a clean, consistent interface to work with. But the kicker is, you can also make a class that takes f.x. a ICreateRepository in its constructor, so the code will end up being very easy to do some really funky stuff with. There are also interfaces for the Services in the business tier here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At last i stick all the domain objects into the extra assembly, just to make the code base itself a bit cleaner and more loosely coupled. These objects dont have any logic, they are just a common way to describe the data for all 3+ layers.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Btw. Why would you define methods in the business logic tier to accommodate the data tier?&lt;br /&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What do you mean by that the data tier should not be aware of the business logic tier? How would you fill an business object with data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UI asks the ServiceClass in the business tier for a service, namely getting a list of objects filtered by an object with the needed parameter data.&lt;br /&gt;
Then the ServiceClass creates an instance of one of the repository classes in the data tier, and calls the GetList(ParameterType filters).&lt;br /&gt;
Then the data tier accesses the database, pulls up the data, and maps it to the common format defined in the "domain" assembly.&lt;br /&gt;
The BL has no more work to do with this data, so it outputs it to the UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the UI wants to edit Item X. It sends the item (or business object) to the service in the Business Tier. The business tier validates the object, and if it is OK, it sends it to the data tier for storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UI knows the service in the business tier which again knows about the data tier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UI is responsible for mapping the users data input to and from the objects, and the data tier is responsible for mapping the data in the db to and from the objects. The Business tier stays purely business. :)&lt;/p&gt;

For example:
Buy a basic server and and eSATA RAID5 setup with 2-3 times the capacity you currently need, then install it at a co-location center. Preferably one with high, but cheap, bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way the server and storage is off-site, but after the initial cost of the hardware, you are only paying for bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, the downside to this is that, unlike something like S3, if the hardware goes down you have to go fix it yourself, or pay the CoLo people to.  But this may be a tradeoff you are willing to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, with this solution, you are still going to need a beefy upload pipe to handle the traffic... so there's always the "sneakernet" solution.&lt;/p&gt;

This runs into security issues if you are sharing your files publicly, but it works. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using Linux though, learn to use rsync. It's really not that difficult as you can test every command with -n. Go through the &lt;a href="http://www.samba.org/ftp/rsync/rsync.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;man page&lt;/a&gt;, the basic format you will want is &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This takes all of the files in my home directory (~) and uses rsync's archive mode (-a), verbosly (-v), lists all of the changes made (-i), while deleting any files that don't exist anymore (--delete) and puts the in the Folder /home/me/School/ on my remote server. All of the information it prints out (what was copied, what was deleted, etc.) is also appended to the file BackupLog.txt&lt;/p&gt;

With 2014 knowledge, I can truly say that auto-properties are among the best things that ever happened to the C# language.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am used to create my properties in C# using a private and a public field:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;private string title;
public string Title
{
    get { return title;  }
    set { title = value;  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework"&gt;.NET&lt;/a&gt; 3.0, we got auto-properties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public string Title { get; set; }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this is more a philosophical/subjective questions, but is there any reason to use these auto-properties except from saving five lines of code for each field? My personal gripe is that those properties are hiding stuff from me, and I am not a big fan of black magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the hidden private field does not even show up in the debugger, which is OK given the fact that the get/set functions do nothing. But when I want to actually implement some getter/setter logic, I have to use the private/public pair anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see the benefit that I save a lot of code (one vs six lines) without losing the ability to change the getter/setter logic later, but then again I can already do that by simply declaring a public field "Public string Title" without the need of the { get; set; } block, thus even saving more code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what am I missing here? Why would anyone actually want to use auto-properties?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up introducing a business layer which sits under the report and rather than "pulling" data from the report we "push" the datasets to it and bind the data to the report. The advantage is that you can manipulate the data in code in datasets or objects before it reaches the report and then simply bind the data to the report.&lt;/p&gt;

I understand that your time/business constraints may not allow you to do this, but if it's at all possible, I'd highly recommend it as it's meant we can remove all "coding" out of our reports and into managed code which is always a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

public:
  static bool getBitAt(int buffer, int bitIndex);

&lt;p&gt;I have two drop-down controls, on the first-drop down I have a javascript &lt;code&gt;onChange&lt;/code&gt; event. The javascript enables the second drop-down and removes a value from it (the value selected in the first drop-down). If they click the blank first value of the drop-down, then the second drop-down will be disabled (and the options reset).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have code in the &lt;code&gt;OnPreRender&lt;/code&gt; method that will enable or disable the second drop-down based on the value of the first drop-down. This is so that the value of the first drop-down can be selected in code (loading user settings).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My problem is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user selects something in the first drop-down. The second drop-down will become enabled through javascript. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They then change a third drop-down that initiates a post back. After the post back the drop-downs are in the correct state (first value selected, second drop-down enabled).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If they then click the back button, the second drop-down will no longer be enabled although it should be since there's something selected in the first drop-down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've tried adding a startup script (that will set the correct state of the second-drop down) through &lt;code&gt;ClientScript.RegisterStartupScript&lt;/code&gt;, however when this gets called the first drop-down has a &lt;code&gt;selectedIndex&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, not what it actually is. My guess is that the value of the selection gets set after my start script (but still doesn't call the &lt;code&gt;onChange&lt;/code&gt; script).&lt;/p&gt;

I believe that Register.ClientScriptBlock is not working because the code you write in that block is executed &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; window.onload is called. And, I assume (I am not sure of this point) that the DOM objects do not have their values set at that time. And, this is why you are getting selectedIndex as always 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View interfaces -- which are interfaces that specify your interactions with your UI, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data interfaces -- which are interfaces that will allow you to specify interactions with your data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to inherit and implement both set of interfaces such that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class BusinessObject : IView, IData
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way, in your data layer you only need to see the interface implementation of IData, while in your UI you only need to see the interface implementation of IView.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another strategy you might want to use is to compose your objects in the UI or Data layers such that they are merely consumed by these layers, e.g.,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class BusinessObject : DomainObject

public class ViewManager&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; where T : DomainObject

public class DataManager&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; where T : DomainObject
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This in turn allows your business object to remain ignorant of both the UI/View layer and the data layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1."Use the &lt;strong&gt;Source&lt;/strong&gt;, Luke"&lt;br /&gt;
In the code where I'm calling DataGrid.DataBind(), use the DataTable.Compute() method (&lt;em&gt;or in my case DataSet.DataTable(0).Compute()&lt;/em&gt;). For example:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Dim strAverage = DataTable.Compute("Avg(ColumnName)", "")

&lt;p&gt;2."&lt;strong&gt;Bound&lt;/strong&gt; for Glory"&lt;br /&gt;
Using the DataGrid.ItemDataBound event, and calculating a running total from every ListItemType.Item and ListItemType.AlternatingItem, finally displaying in ListItemType.Footer. For example:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Select Case e.Item.ItemType
    Case ListItemType.Item, ListItemType.AlternatingItem
        runningTotal += CInt(e.Item.Cells(2).Text)
    Case ListItemType.Footer
        e.Item.Cells(2).Text = runningTotal/DataGrid.Items.Count
End Select

&lt;p&gt;A prototype for a function which takes a function parameter looks like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void func ( void (*f)(int) );
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This states that the parameter f will be a pointer to a function which has a void return type and which takes a single int parameter. The following function (print) is an example of a function which could be passed to func as a parameter because it is the proper type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void print ( int x ) {
  cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; x &amp;lt;&amp;lt; endl;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Function Call&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When calling a function with a function parameter, the value passed must be a pointer to a function. Use the function's name (without parens) for this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;func(print);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;would call func, passing the print function to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Function Body&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any parameter, func can now use the parameter's name in the function body to access the value of the parameter. Let's say that func will apply the function it is passed to the numbers 0-4. Consider, first, what the loop would look like to call print directly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for ( int ctr = 0 ; ctr &amp;lt; 5 ; ctr++ ) {
  print(ctr);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since func's parameter declaration says that f is the name for a pointer to the desired function, we recall first that if f is a pointer then *f is the thing that f points to (i.e. the function print in this case). As a result, just replace every occurrence of print in the loop above with *f:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void func ( void (*f)(int) ) {
  for ( int ctr = 0 ; ctr &amp;lt; 5 ; ctr++ ) {
    (*f)(ctr);
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

This may not be an easy task depending on the code. If it was written with 64-bit portability in mind then it could be a simple recompile. If it hasn't, then you could well be up for quite a bit of patching before getting it to build.. and then you'd have to verify that you haven't broken anything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think you're overestimating the differences between 32 and 64-bit at all. A common mistake is to assume that the job is a simple recompile when in fact it isn't. There are more portability issues than most people realise. Just because the application builds and you end up with a binary, it doesn't mean that the binary is going to behave as it should. Especially when it may interact with other 32-bit code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, it might be worth giving it a spin!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Lars: I recommend reading the question before attempting an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@John Sibly &amp;amp; @DannySmurf: given the nature of Memcached and what it aims to achieve, surely you wouldn't want to run a 32-bit version on a 64-bit machine? If you had a 64-bit capable machine it would make sense to run a 64-bit version to make the most of the features of the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

To avoid this unpleasantness I would recommend that you typedef the function pointer into something more readable. For example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;typedef void (*functiontype)();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Declares a function that returns void and takes no arguments. To create a function pointer to this type you can now do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void dosomething() { }

functiontype func = &amp;amp;dosomething;
func();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a function that returns an int and takes a char you would do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;typedef int (*functiontype2)(char);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and to use it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int dosomethingwithchar(char a) { return 1; }

functiontype2 func2 = &amp;amp;dosomethingwithchar
int result = func2('a');
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are libraries that can help with turning function pointers into nice readable types. The &lt;a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_36_0/doc/html/function.html"&gt;boost function&lt;/a&gt; library is great and is well worth the effort!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;boost::function&amp;lt;int (char a)&amp;gt; functiontype2;

But I am kind of skeptical that it actually provides much productivity gains. Alt-Tab and the taskbar already make it pretty easy to swap between windows. Can also setup shortcuts to swap to certain windows. One thing I see multiple monitors buying you is that its easier to move the mouse to the window you want to work on instead of using alt-tab/taskbar/keyboard shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm currently running two monitors at work and I find I can only focus on one monitor at a time. And I have to turn my head to focus on the second monitor. So I tend to move stuff that could of just stayed in the background to the extra monitor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My problem is, if there is already something in the onload event, than this overwrites it. 
How would I go about allowing two user controls to each execute javascript in the onload event?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While looking through some sample mobile sites we noticed that a lot of site that have WAP in the url are actually just simplified HTML files.  &lt;a href="http://wap.mlb.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://wap.mlb.com&lt;/a&gt; is not really WAP enabled but simple HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is WAP a think of the past?  With smartphones and the iPhone having the ability to render sites as is do we need to worry about WML and WAP or will a stripped down html version be enough?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also can you recommend a blog or tutorial or answer below how best to check for mobile devices?  Do we as the programmer need to know each variation of user agent in order to redirect them to our mobile site? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write some libraries and interfaces to serialize your objects into REST-compatible XML.
You can't neccessarily just use the built-in serializers, because your service may not accept the same kind of XML that .NET wants to give you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: When passing booleans to a Rails REST service, &lt;code&gt;"true"&lt;/code&gt; gets unserialized as &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, whereas &lt;code&gt;"True"&lt;/code&gt; (which .NET gives you) unserializes to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write some libraries to do the HTTP, wrapping around the basic .NET &lt;code&gt;WebRequest&lt;/code&gt; objects.
You might get some mileage out of some third party libraries in this area as it tends to be more standard. I found some issues though, such as this &lt;a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/community/blogs/dana/archive/2006/07/28/1484.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;lovely bug in the .NET framework&lt;/a&gt;, so I'm glad I stuck with the basics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While WAP got a lot of bad press, it's strength is where you have low bandwidth high-latency connections.   The WML content gets optimised by the carrier's gateway to greatly reduce the amount of data transmitted over the air.  If you have iPhones and the like, in areas with solid 3G coverage you can afford to go for richer content, but if you want an app to still perform well in more out of the way areas, WAP has a big advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to watch out for with WAP is that the quality of the WAP support in handsets varies a lot (guess you'd also say the same for smartphone web browsers).  Most of them display pages ok, but the form handling is truly awful in some browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you vary content based on user-agent, you should also provide an explicit way to access a specific type of content (e.g. seperate uri's) - the automated choice is not always right and you want the client to be able to override it .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you go with WAP development check out WinWAP - a Windows-based WAP browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than subject users to the hangs, we've rolled back to the previous release while we determine a solution.  The first step is to reproduce the problem -- but we can't. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's some background:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prod has a single virtualized (vmware) web server with two CPUs and 2 GB of RAM.  The database server has 4GB, and 2 CPUs as well.  It's also on VMWare, but separate physical hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During normal usage the application runs fine.  The w3wp.exe process normally uses betwen 5-20% CPU and around 200MB of RAM.  CPU and RAM fluctuate slightly under normal use, but nothing unusual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when we start running into problems, the RAM climbs dramatically and the CPU pegs at 98% (or as much as it can get).  The site becomes unresponsive, necessitating a IIS restart.  Resetting the app pool does nothing in this situation, a full IIS restart is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does not happen during the night (no usage).  It happens more when the site is under load, but it has also happened under non-peak periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First step to solving this problem is reproducing it. To simulate the load, we starting using JMeter to simulate usage. Our load script is based on actual usage around the time of the crash.  Using JMeter, we can ramp the usage up quite high (2-3 times the load during the crash) but the site behaves fine.  CPU is up high, and the site does become sluggish, but memory usage is reasonable and nothing is hanging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any tips on how to reproduce a problem like this in a non-production environment?  We'd really like to reproduce the error, determine a solution, then test again to make sure we've resolved it.  During the process we've found a number of small things that we've improved that might solve the problem, but I'd really feel a lot more confident if we could reproduce the problem and test the improved version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any tools, techniques or theories much appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Id="9502" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="9240" CreationDate="2008-08-13T06:08:24.597" Score="7" Body="&lt;p&gt;If I understand the question correctly, you've created a domain model and you would like to write an object-relational mapper to map between records in your database and your domain objects. However, you're concerned about polluting your domain model with the 'plumbing' code that would be necessary to read and write to your object's fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a step back, you essentially have two choices of where to put your data mapping code - within the domain class itself or in an external mapping class.
The first option is often called the Active Record pattern and has the advantage that each object knows how to persist itself and has sufficient access to its internal structure to allow it to perform the mapping without needing to expose non-business related fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class User
{
 private string name;
 private AccountStatus status;

 private User()
 {
 }

 public string Name
 {
  get { return name; }
  set { name = value; }
 }

 public AccountStatus Status
 {
  get { return status; }
 }

 public void Activate()
 {
  status = AccountStatus.Active;
 }

 public void Suspend()
 {
  status = AccountStatus.Suspended;
 }

 public static User GetById(int id)
 {
  User fetchedUser = new User();

  // Lots of database and error-checking code
  // omitted for clarity
  // ...

  fetchedUser.name = (string) reader["Name"];
  fetchedUser.status = (int)reader["statusCode"] == 0 ? AccountStatus.Suspended : AccountStatus.Active;

  return fetchedUser;
 }

 public static void Save(User user)
 {
  // Code to save User's internal structure to database
  // ...
 }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, we have an object that represents a User with a Name and an AccountStatus. We don't want to allow the Status to be set directly, perhaps because we want to check that the change is a valid status transition, so we don't have a setter. Fortunately, the mapping code in the GetById and Save static methods have full access to the object's name and status fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second option is to have a second class that is responsible for the mapping. This has the advantage of seperating out the different concerns of business logic and persistence which can allow your design to be more testable and flexible. The challenge with this method is how to expose the name and status fields to the external class. Some options are:
  1. Use reflection (which has no qualms about digging deep into your object's private parts)
  2. Provide specially-named, public setters (e.g. prefix them with the word 'Private') and hope no one uses them accidentally
  3. If your language suports it, make the setters internal but grant your data mapper module access. E.g. use the InternalsVisibleToAttribute in .NET 2.0 onwards or friend functions in C++&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information, I'd recommend Martin Fowler's classic book 'Patterns of Enterprise Architecture'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as a word of warning, before going down the path of writing your own mappers I'd strongly recommend looking at using a 3rd-party object relational mapper (ORM) tool such as nHibernate or Microsoft's Entity Framework. I've worked on four different projects where, for various reasons, we wrote our own mapper and it is very easy to waste a lot of time maintaining and extending the mapper instead of writing code that provides end user value. I've used nHibernate on one project so far and, although it has quite a steep learning curve initially, the investment you put in early on pays off considerably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The background is that we have a windows service (.NET 2.0 exe built with VS2005, deployed to ~150 servers) that dynamically loads assemblies (almost like plug-ins) to complete various work items asked of it. Whenever we roll out a new version of the bus logic, we just drop the assemblies on an FTP server and the windows service knows how to check for, grab and store the latest versions. New assemblies are now built using VS2008 and targetting .NET 2.0, we know that works ok. However we'd like to start taking advantage of C# 3.0 language features such as LINQ and targetting the assemblies against .NET 3.5 without having to build and deploy a new version of the windows service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Controls, though, are a different story, as far as naming goes.  I think that scope is assumed, and prepending a few letters to indicate type (txtMyGroovyTextbox, for example) makes more sense for the same reason; controls are grouped in Intellisense by type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...your handler will respond with a formatted XML sitemap. Whether that sitemap is generated on the fly, from a database, or some other method is up to the HTTP Handler implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's roughly what it would look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void IHttpHandler.ProcessRequest(HttpContext context)
{
    //
    // Important to return qualified XML (text/xml) for sitemaps
    //
    context.Response.ClearHeaders();
    context.Response.ClearContent();
    context.Response.ContentType = "text/xml";
    //
    // Create an XML writer
    //
    XmlTextWriter writer = new XmlTextWriter(context.Response.Output);
    writer.WriteStartDocument();
    writer.WriteStartElement("urlset", "http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9");
    //
    // Now add entries for individual pages..
    //
    writer.WriteStartElement("url");
    writer.WriteElementString("loc", "http://www.codingthewheel.com");
    // use W3 date format..
    writer.WriteElementString("lastmod", postDate.ToString("yyyy-MM-dd"));
    writer.WriteElementString("changefreq", "daily");
    writer.WriteElementString("priority", "1.0");
    writer.WriteEndElement();
    //
    // Close everything out and go home.
    //
    result.WriteEndElement();
    result.WriteEndDocument();
    writer.Flush();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This code can be improved but that's the basic idea.&lt;/p&gt;

Just to clarify. I need to deploy several "SharePoint Sites" into an existing site collection. Since SharePoint likes to have its sites in the SharePoint content database, just putting the files into IIS is not an option at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

For anyone new to programming I think having something to show for a little amount of effort is a good way to keep them interested. Once you have covered the fundamentals of Python then you should sit back and let him experiement with the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of my University subjects for this semester they have taken an approach called Problem Based Learning(PBL) in which they use lectures to stimulate students about different approaches to problems. Since your brother is keen you should take a similiar approach. Set him small projects to work on and let him figure it out for himself. Then once he is finished you can go through his approach and compare and contrast with different methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can give him just the right amount of help to steer him in the right direction then he should be fine. Providng him with some good websites and books would also be a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd also recommend sticking away from IDE's at the starting stages. Using the command line and a text editor will give him a greater understanding of the processes involved in compiling/assembling code.&lt;/p&gt;

There is a W3C recommendation for SVG though this format is still not recognized by Internet Explorer support of which is a must (for a public website). IE handles VML though and there are even javascript libraries that do some canvas-like drawing depending on a browser (SVG vs. VML) - &lt;a href="http://excanvas.sourceforge.net/"&gt;excanvas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/book/dojo-book-0-9/part-3-programmatic-dijit-and-dojo/drawing-gfx"&gt;GFX of Dojo Toolkit&lt;/a&gt; and more. That would be nice and acceptable though none of them can display an SVG image from the given markup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the question actually consists of several parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there any cross-browser Javascript libraries that display vector graphics from given markup (not obligatory SVG) and offer availability to attach to DOM events?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there are not, which of the most pupular browser-embedded technologies would be most suitable for doing such a task? I can choose from Flex/Flash, Java applet. Silverlight is not an option because of Windows lock-in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;] Thank you all for your comments/suggestions. Below are just some my random notes/conclusions on this matter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The level of interactivity I need is ability to detect DOM events on the vector image being displayed - mouseover, mouseout, click etc. - and ability to react on them like changing background color, displaying dialog etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The idea of sticking with SVG format is quite well as it is native on many browsers except the most popular one - IE. After some experimenting with displaying dynamic SVG I realized that IE version 7 the most problematic. There's too much hassle because of browser incompatibilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cake seems a great Javascript framework, though I could not get the examples working on IE7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java Applets - I liked that idea the most as I though I could use the Apache Batik library, a quality SVG renderer. However, Batik is very big library and I cannot afford deploying an applet that weights few megabytes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I decided to stick with the Flex option. I found a nice vector graphics library &lt;a href="http://www.degrafa.com/"&gt;Degrafa&lt;/a&gt;. It uses its own markup format however it recognizes SVG path notation, so in my case it is going to be quite easy to transform my SVGs using XSLT or just parsing them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 2&lt;/strong&gt;] Some more comments appeared. I'd like to clarify that by "Windows lock-in" I mean the situation that Silverlight would normally run on Windows, more specifically, IE. I doubt it is an accepted solution (like Flash or Java Applet, for instance) on other systems. Yes, I have no doubt that one &lt;em&gt;is able to&lt;/em&gt; launch Silverlight app on any system though I fear it would be too much effort for an average user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Akira: Have you had any problems with those "SVG renderers" on IE7? I get thrown Javascript errors all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

There is a process that is responsible for playing a certain wave file on this device's wave out (ISDN connection is made at startup and made persistent). The scenario is easy, whenever needed the process calls &lt;code&gt;waveOutWrite()&lt;/code&gt; on the previously opened wave device (everything initialized without any problems of course) and a callback function waits for &lt;code&gt;MM_WOM_DONE&lt;/code&gt; msg to know that the playback has been finished. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since a few days however (nothing changed neither in the process nor the machine) the &lt;code&gt;MM_WOM_DONE&lt;/code&gt; message has been coming immediately after calling &lt;code&gt;waveOutWrite()&lt;/code&gt; even though the wave lasts a couple of seconds. Again no error is reported, it looks like the file was played but had zero length (which is not the case). I am also sure that &lt;code&gt;waveOutReset()&lt;/code&gt; was not called by my process (it would also trigger sending the mentioned message). I have already used to have some strange problems in the past that where solved simply by reinstalling TAPI drivers. This time for some reason it is problematic for me to perform that once again and I am trying more analytical approach :). Any suggestions what might cause such a behavior?

Currently, if two users open the same document, then modify it and save the changes, the document's state will be undefined (either the first user's changes are saved permanently, or the second's). This is entirely unsatisfactory. I considered two possibilities to solve this problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is to lock the document when it is opened by someone the first time, and unlock it when it is closed. But if the network connection to the server is suddenly interrupted, the document would stay in a forever-locked state. The obvious solution is to send regular pings to the server. If the server doesn't receive K pings in a row (K &gt; 1) from a particular client, documents locked by this client are unlocked. If that client re-appears, documents are locked again, if someone hadn't already locked them. This could also help if the client application (running in web browser) is terminated unexpectedly, making it impossible to send a 'quitting, unlock my documents' signal to the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is to store multiple versions of the same document saved by different users. If changes to the document are made in rapid succession, the system would offer either to merge versions or to select a preferred version. To optimize storage space, only document diffs should be kept (just like source control software).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What method should I choose, taking into consideration that the connection to the server might &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt; be slow and unresponsive? How should the parameters (ping interval, rapid succession interval) be determined?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Unfortunately, I can't store the documents in a database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual sql query gets created dynamically depending on which fields are searched.  Most solutions I've found involve complicated if blocks, but I can't help but think there must be a more elegant solution since this must be a solved problem by now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, so I've started down the path of dynamically building the sql in code.  Seems godawful.  If I really try to support the requested ability to query any combination of any field in any table this is going to be one MASSIVE set of if statements.  &lt;em&gt;shiver&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the second check inside the lock it's possible the initialisation code will be executed twice. So the first check is for performance to save you taking a lock unnecessarily, and the second check is for the case where a thread is executing the initialisation code but hasn't yet set the &lt;code&gt;s_Initialized&lt;/code&gt; flag and so a second thread would pass the first check and be waiting at the lock.&lt;/p&gt;

When the first user (Bob) opens the document, he acquires a lock so that other users can only read the current document. If the user saves the document while he is using it, he keeps the lock. Only when he exits the document, it is unlocked and other people can edit it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the second user (Kate) opens the document while Bob has the lock on it, Kate will get a message saying the document is uneditable but she can read it until it the lock has been released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what happens when Bob acquires the lock, maybe saves the document once or twice but then exits the application leaving the lock hanging? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you said yourself, requiring the client with the lock to send pings at a certain frequency is probably the best option. If you don't get a ping from the client for a set amount of time, this effectively means his client is not responding anymore. If this is a web application you can use javascript for the pings. The document that was last saved releases its lock and Kate can now acquire it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A ping can contain the name of the document that the client has a lock on, and the server can calculate when the last ping for that document was received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A point which has been brought up recurrently, is that of dealing with system vs. user values; in our project user and system vals are stored together. For example...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a list of templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1, &amp;lt;system template&amp;gt;

2, &amp;lt;system template&amp;gt;

3, &amp;lt;system template&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are mapped in the app to an enum (1, 2, 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then a user comes in and adds...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;4, &amp;lt;user template&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...and...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;5, &amp;lt;user template&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then.. we issue an upgrade.. and insert as part of our upgrade scripts...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;new id&amp;gt; [6], &amp;lt;new system template&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THEN!!... we find a bug in the new system template and need to update it... The problem is how? We cannot update record using ID6 (as we may have inserted it as 9, or 999, so we have to identify the record using some other mechanism)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we've come to two possible solutions for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the red corner (speed)....&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We simply start user Ids at 5000 (or some other value) and test data at 10000 (or some other value). This would allow us to make modifications to system values and test them up to the lower limit of the next ID range. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advantage...Quick and easy to implement, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disadvantage... could run out of values if we don't choose a big enough range!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the blue corner (scalability)...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We store, system and user data separately, use GUIDs as Ids and merge the two lists using a view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advantage...Scalable..No limits w/regard to DB size. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disadvantage.. More complicated to implement. (many to one updatable views etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plump squarely for the first option, but looking for some ammo to back me up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any thoughts on these approaches, or even one(s) that we've missed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately yes!!  It shouldn't be but it still is.  One of the best examples is that Steve Wozniak worked for HP at the time he designed the Apple I... as such he was required to give them "first rights" to his design! Fortunately for him and Jobs, they thought it was crap!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some companies really do stretch the limits of this, and the laws definitely need to change.  But what they are trying to do is cover themselves legally in the case that you &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; do something on company time and release it under your name, but they can't prove that you did it on their time...so by owning &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; you do, they've covered that issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I wouldn't work for a company that does this...I've got too many side projects that I enjoy working on and would not want to give up.  And it's not far from slavery in my mind.  I've actually tried to simply cross out those sections on a contract in the past (which is entirely legal and if they sign it that way it is binding) but they would not sign it without those sections intact... so I walked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you have signed it...go to them and tell them that you have researched it more and have concerns.  They may be willing to work out a deal with you, you never know unless you ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: One thing to keep in mind...to CYA, &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; work on anything that is your own while at work or on their computer...even it you are at home with your company laptop.  Even if the company doesn't have these rules, like mine, if you release something and they then find out that you did use company resources, whatever you created is theirs...and possibly even anything you created in the past.  It can be  real mess.  Oh, and make your whatever you do is in a very different business segment from your work...anti-compete laws can be a bitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most of those cases, the employer was OK with the amendment. In a few cases, they also insisted on something of a non-compete clause so that the employee couldn't launch a competing product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally have avoided signing by pointing out the absurdity and asking for explicit permission to own the short stories, poetry, photography, songs, paintings and the novel I dabble with on the weekends.

They let me stay on without agreeing to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Finally, a technique I often use is storing configuration information in a SharePoint List. Chris O'Brien has a great framework for that here: http://www.codeplex.com/SPConfigStore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps,

&lt;p&gt;Does &lt;em&gt;reverse&lt;/em&gt; mean setting 1's to 0's and vice versa?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or does it mean &lt;em&gt;00001100&lt;/em&gt; --&gt; &lt;em&gt;00110000&lt;/em&gt; where you reverse their order in the byte? Or perhaps just reversing the part that is from the first 1 to the last 1? ie. &lt;em&gt;00110101&lt;/em&gt; --&gt; &lt;em&gt;00101011&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming it means reversing the bit order in the whole byte, here's an x86 assembler version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;; al is input register
; bl is output register

xor bl, bl      ; clear output

; first bit
rcl al, 1       ; rotate al through carry
rcr bl, 1       ; rotate carry into bl

; duplicate above 2-line statements 7 more times for the other bits

Which one to choose really comes down to a number of factors but essentially boils down to how the business wants to work. For example, would it unduly inconvenience the users if a document they needed to edit was locked by another user? What happens if a document is locked and someone goes on holiday with their client connected? What is the likely contention for each document - i.e. how likely is it that the same document will be modified by two users at the same time?, how localised are the modifications likely to be within a single document? (If the same section is modified regularly then performing a merge may take longer than simply making the changes again). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming the contention is relatively low and/or the size of each change is fairly small then I would probably opt for an optimistic model that resolves conflicts using an automatic or manual merge. A version number or a checksum of the document's contents can be used to determine if a merge is required.&lt;/p&gt;

According to what I found &lt;a href="http://engr.smu.edu/~kocan/7343/fall05/slides/chapter11.ppt"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; there are many ways for an O.S. to schedule disk requests. While Linux and others can choose between different policies, before Vista Windows was locked in a single policy: a FIFO queue, where all requests where splitted in 64 KB blocks. I believe that this policy is the cause for the problem you are experiencing: the scheduler will mix requests from the two threads, causing continuous seek between different areas of the disk.&lt;br /&gt;
Now, the good news is that according to &lt;a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc162494.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://widefox.pbwiki.com/IO"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, Vista introduced a smarter disk scheduler, where you can set the priority of your requests and also allocate a minimum badwidth for your process.&lt;br /&gt;
The bad news is that I found no way to change disk policy or buffers size in previous versions of Windows. Also, even if raising disk I/O priority of your process will boost the performance against the other processes, you still have the problems of your threads competing against each other.&lt;br /&gt;
What I can suggest is to modify your software by introducing a self-made disk access policy.&lt;br /&gt;
For example, you could use a policy like this in your thread B (similar for Thread A):  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if THREAD A is reading from disk then wait for THREAD A to stop reading or wait for X ms
Read for X ms (or Y MB)
Stop reading and check status of thread A again
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could use semaphores for status checking or you could use perfmon counters to get the status of the actual disk queue.
The values of X and/or Y could also be auto-tuned by checking the actual trasfer rates and slowly modify them, thus maximizing the throughtput when the application runs on different machines and/or O.S. You could find that cache, memory or RAID levels affect them in a way or the other, but with auto-tuning you will always get the best performance in every scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;February in a non-leap year will have 28 days, and if the first day of the month is a monday, february will span exactly 4 week numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if the first day of the month is a tuesday, or any other day of the week, february will span 5 week numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 31 day month can span 5 or 6 weeks the same way. If the month starts on a monday, the 31 days gives you 5 week numbers. If the month starts on saturday or sunday, it will span 6 week numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the right way to obtain this number is to find the week number of the first and last days of the month.&lt;/p&gt;

On top of this we have 4 Windows Server 2003 machines running, making up the Active Directory, Exchange, ISA, Database and Windows/AV updates component. File sharing and internet routing through the corporate network and ADSL is handled via the CentOS platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setup allows us to expand to physical machines at a later stage quickly, and allows the main server to replaced with minimum downtime on the network, as it only requires the moving of the Virtual Machines and starting them up on the new box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your question above, I would either recommend a third column (if possible) that indicates whether or not the template is user or system based, or you can at the very least generate GUIDs for system templates as you insert them and keep a list of those on hand, so that if you need to update the template, you can just target that same GUID in your DEV, UAT and /or PRODUCTION databases without fear of overwriting other templates. The third column would come in handy though for selecting all system or user templates at will, without the need to seperate them into two tables (this is overkill IMHO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that helps,&lt;/p&gt;

People mostly extend existing documents and correct mistakes in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking about the pessimistic model, the 'left client connected for N days' scenario could be avoided by setting lock expire date to, say, one day before lock start date. Because documents edited are by no means mission critical, and are modified by multiple users quite rarely, that could be enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now consider the optimistic model. How should the differences be detected, if the documents have some regular (say, hierarchical) structure? If not? What are the chances of successful automatic merge in these cases?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation becomes more complicated, because some of the documents (edited by the 'admins' user group) contain important configuration information (document global index, user roles, etc.). To my mind, locks are more advantageous for precisely this kind of information, because it's not changed on everyday basis. So some hybrid solution might be acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

I think it would be more correct to say that it's probably worthwhile writing your backend code in C++, regardless of the performance implications. Even though you can't tie your higher-ups down on the platform switch, it would be prudent of you to make preparations for that eventuality, since management types tend to change their mind alot without good reason (or warning); even if they decide not to switch now, that doesn't mean that they won't decide to switch six months from now. Writing your logic in C++ now, knowing that it's a possibility, though more difficult, may make your life significantly easier later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Not really. There are "solutions" like wxWindows and GTK#, but often they're buggy, or difficult to get working properly, or they lack something important on one platform or another. They also usually lock you into a lowest-common-denominator UI (ie, general controls work fine but you can forget about ever doing something interesting -- WPF, for example -- with it). UIs are easy to write, so I think if you write your logic in something that's portable, it should be a trivial matter to knock together several platform-specific UIs.&lt;/p&gt;

Nickname nvarchar(10)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and you want to search optionally for name or nickname.  The following query will do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT Name, Nickname
FROM Users
WHERE
    Name = COALESCE(@name, Name) AND
    Nickname =  COALESCE(@nick, Nickname)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't want to search for something, just pass in a null.  For example, passing in "brian" for @name and null for @nick results in the following query being evaluated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT Name, Nickname
FROM Users
WHERE
    Name = 'brian' AND
    Nickname =  Nickname
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coalesce operator turns the null into an identity evaluation, which is always true and doesn't affect the where clause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, in the resources section, add a ContextMenu which you plan to use as your standard ContextMenu in a textbox.&lt;br /&gt; e.g.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ContextMenu x:Key="TextBoxContextMenu" Background="White"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;MenuItem Command="ApplicationCommands.Copy" /&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;MenuItem Command="ApplicationCommands.Paste" /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ContextMenu&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, create a style for your TextBoxes, which uses the context menu resource:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Style TargetType="{x:Type TextBox}"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;Setter Property="ContextMenu" Value="{StaticResource TextBoxContextMenu}" /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/Style&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, use your text box as normal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;TextBox /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If instead you want to apply this context menu to only some of your textboxes, do not create the style above, and add the following to your TextBox markup:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;TextBox ContextMenu="{StaticResource TextBoxContextMenu}" /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

I've toyed with this idea in the past but I don't think it's really a good idea for a number of reasons. Firstly, there are a number of places that can take care of most of this without you needing to do the work or maintenance. Just signing up for a linkedIn account for example will allow you to get most of your needs catered for in this regard. You can create your resume there and bio information etc and make it publicly viewable. The other issue with your "own site" is that if you don't update it often, the information gets stale, and worse yet, people have no reason to go back because &lt;em&gt;"nothing has changed"&lt;/em&gt; - and that's not much of an &lt;em&gt;advert&lt;/em&gt; for you is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I've said all that, I'll make another recommendation. Why not start a blog instead?! If you've got decent experience, why not share that. I'd be willing to bet that this will be the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; advert for your skills because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's always updated (if you post often)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's not like you're &lt;em&gt;looking&lt;/em&gt; for work doing it - but your (future) employer, or their developers will check it out anyway to get a better insight into your character.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Putting something on your resume doesn't mean you can do it. I'm not saying that you'd lie about your skills :-), but there's no argument about your ability when you're writing articles about the stuff, getting comments and feedback, and better yet, learning &lt;em&gt;EVEN MORE&lt;/em&gt; about your passions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best of all - you can run your blog from your chosen domain and also point to your resume that is stored in linkedIn. Just an idea...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's my two pennys worth on that - hope it helps you come to a decision!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What specifically does that question mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good question.  If reversing the "ON" bits means reversing only the bits that are "ON", then you will always get 0, no matter what the input is.  If it means reversing &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the bits, i.e. changing all 1s to 0s and all 0s to 1s, which is how I initially read it, then that's just a bitwise NOT, or complement.  C-based languages have a complement operator, &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;, that does this.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;unsigned char b = 102;      /* 0x66, 01100110 */
unsigned char reverse = ~b; /* 0x99, 10011001 */

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of ways to do this. My personal favourite is dumping a bunch of code that's out of order on them, or which I worked on with someone else (which means I can give them, at most, 50% of the actual code I have), or to print everything out in 36-point font and give them a mile-high stack of paper. They may be able to force you to give them your intellectual property. However, in my experience, most companies neglect to specify HOW you have to give it to them, and it's always just assumed that you'll give it to them in a coherent form that they can use... except that this is never stated, which gives you a BIG out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0321374479" rel="nofollow" title="Inside Windows Vista Kernel"&gt;Essential Windows Presentation Foundation - Chris Anderson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

This is a great reference book - one that sits on my desk and is constantly referred too. However, I didn't feel is was as newbie friendly as the other two books above. This is the most recently released book (at the time of this posting), and has been updated for VS2008. This is useful, as there are some changes with the versions of WPF. I believe there is a VB.NET version available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0596510373" rel="nofollow"&gt;Programming WPF - Chris Sells &amp;amp; Ian Griffiths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0735619573" rel="nofollow"&gt;Application = Code + Markup - Charles Petzold&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This was the very first WPF I purchased. It is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; very newbie friendly, and I wouldn't recommend it for a first-time-wpf'er. The fact that Xaml is not introduced until page 457 makes learning the technology for the real world very difficult. That said, this book is invaluable if you really want to understand how things work at a very deep level (which is also important to get the most of the framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only book I would totally avoid is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0470041803" rel="nofollow"&gt;Professional WPF Programming - Chris Andrade et al.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While the content was Ok in this book, I just found the other books to be much clearer and delve to a much deeper level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps! WPF has a steep learning curve, but once you "get it", UI programming can actually become "fun"!&lt;/p&gt;

In this case you're only requesting a small piece of information (a date) across the WAN most of the times the document is accessed. This works best for a subset of documents that are frequently requested. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a large set of documents, each infrequently requested by a disparate group, then you may want to look into replicating the documents in each of your zones each time the master is updated.

Assuming strict mode (the default compiler mode) it is not possible to modify the prototype of non-dynamic class types in ActionScript 3. I'm not even sure that it's possible in non-strict mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is wrapping an option? Basically you create a class that takes one of the objects you get from the web service and just forwards all method calls to that, but also has methods of its own:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class FooWrapper extends Foo {

    private var wrappedFoo : Foo;

    public function FooWrapper( foo : Foo ) {
        wrappedFoo = foo;
    }

    override public function methodFromFoo( ) : void {
     wrappedFoo.methodFromFoo();
 }

 override public function anotherMethodFromFoo( ) : void {
  wrappedFoo.anotherMethodFromFoo();
 }

 public function newMethodNotOnFoo( ) : String {
  return "Hello world!"
 }

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you want to work with a &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt;, but also have the extra method you need you wrap the &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt; instance in a &lt;code&gt;FooWrapper&lt;/code&gt; and work with that object instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not the most convenient solution, there's a lot of typing and if the generated code changes you have to change the &lt;code&gt;FooWrapper&lt;/code&gt; class by hand, but unless you can modify the generated code either to include the method you want or to make the class dynamic I don't see how it can be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another solution is to add a step to your build process that modifies the source of the generated classes. I assume that you already have a step that generates the code from a WSDL, so what you could do is to add a step after that that inserts the methods you need.&lt;/p&gt;

Changes to the schema for a single release go into a script file created specifically for that release.  All stored procs, views, etc should go into individual files and treated just like .cs or .aspx as far as source control goes.  I use a powershell script to generate one big .sql file for updating the programmability stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't like automating the application of schema changes, like new tables, new columns, etc.  When doing a production release, I like to go through the change script command by command to make sure each one works as expected.  There's nothing worse than running a big change script on production and getting errors because you forgot some little detail that didn't present itself in development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also learned that indexes need to be treated just like code files and put into source control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you should definitely have more than 2 databases - dev and live.  You should have a dev database that everybody uses for daily dev tasks.  Then a staging database that mimics production and is used to do your integration testing.  Then maybe a complete recent copy of production (restored from a full backup), if that is feasible, so your last round of installation testing goes against something that is as close to the real thing as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.NET sends in connection settings that are not the same as what you get when you log in to management studio.  Here is what you see if you sniff the connection with Sql Profiler:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;-- network protocol: TCP/IP  
set quoted_identifier off  
set arithabort off  
set numeric_roundabort off  
set ansi_warnings on  
set ansi_padding on  
set ansi_nulls off  
set concat_null_yields_null on  
set cursor_close_on_commit off  
set implicit_transactions off  
set language us_english  
set dateformat mdy  
set datefirst 7  
set transaction isolation level read committed  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am now pasting those setting in above every query that I run when logged in to sql server, to make sure the settings are the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this case, I tried each setting individually, after disconnecting and reconnecting, and found that changing arithabort from off to on reduced the problem query from 90 seconds to 1 second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most probable explanation is related to parameter sniffing, which is a technique Sql Server uses to pick what it thinks is the most effective query plan.  When you change one of the connection settings, the query optimizer might choose a different plan, and in this case, it apparently chose a bad one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I'm not totally convinced of this.  I have tried comparing the actual query plans after changing this setting and I have yet to see the diff show any changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there something else about the arithabort setting that might cause a query to run slowly in some cases?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution seemed simple: Just put set arithabort on into the top of the stored procedure.  But this could lead to the opposite problem: change the query parameters and suddenly it runs faster with 'off' than 'on'.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the time being I am running the procedure 'with recompile' to make sure the plan gets regenerated each time.  It's Ok for this particular report, since it takes maybe a second to recompile, and this isn't too noticeable on a report that takes 1-10 seconds to return (it's a monster).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it's not an option for other queries that run much more frequently and need to return as quickly as possible, in just a few milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;

The real hard thing about talking to a specialized community is keeping the detail level high and the scope narrow.  What's the point of talking to a bunch of .NET programmers about the benefits of Polymorphism?  It always kills me when I go to a meeting on a particular subject and get the most rudimentary explanation and examples.  Its a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MSDN webcasts have a level system that describes the complexity of the subject.  Most are level 100 or 200.  If you're dealing with a group of professionals, your talks should always be at level 600-1000.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to talking about technical subjects, another big area to hit is professional development.  How do you make yourself a more valuable programmer?  These types of talks are great for bringing in other people, such as management, sales, customers, etc.  People who you normally only associate with under protest, and who you typically curse under your breath when they walk by.  A user group forum is a great way to bring these people together with developers in a pseudo-group therapy like setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, donuts.&lt;/p&gt;

Because of this, it currently can only use basicHttp binding.  The webservice will return fairly large amounts of XML data.  This seems fairly wasteful from a bandwidth usage standpoint as the response, if zipped, would be smaller by a factor of 5 (I actually pasted the response into a txt file and zipped it.).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The request does have the "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate" - Is there any way have the WCF service gzip (or otherwise compress) the response?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did find this &lt;a href="http://www.vistax64.com/indigo/113763-wcf-client-j2ee-server-using-gzip.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; but it sure seems a bit complex for functionality that should be handled out-of-the-box IMHO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK - at first I marked the solution using the System.IO.Compression as the answer as I could never "seem" to get the IIS7 dynamic compression to work.  Well, as it turns out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynamic Compression on IIS7 &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; working al along.  It is just that Nikhil's Web Developer Helper plugin for IE did not show it working.  My guess is that since SL hands the web service call off to the browser, that the browser handles it "under the covers" and Nikhil's tool never sees the compressed response.  I was able to confirm this by using Fiddler which monitors traffic external to the browser application.  In fiddler, the response was, in fact, gzip compressed!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other problem with the System.IO.Compression solution is that System.IO.Compression does not exist in the Silverlight CLR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So from my perspective, the EASIEST way to enable WCF compression in Silverlight is to enable Dynamic Compression in IIS7 and write no code at all.&lt;/p&gt;

This means that the SQL only has to be sent once to the database engine even though the statement is executed many times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, a statement is a single SQL query, that's just the rule. The AIR SQL API doesn't allow sending raw SQL to SQLite, only single statements, and the reason is, likely, that AIR uses the &lt;code&gt;sqlite_prepare&lt;/code&gt; function when it talks to SQLite.&lt;/p&gt;

Flash programmability is very limited in my experience, you can do anything, but it will be slow and take thousands of lines of code to get there.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need&lt;/strong&gt;: You have 40 database tables, in some, you may have a column which is a integer values 1-9 representing some enum. Sure it makes sense in code, but not if you need to SQL the DB in a report getting only rows of type "active" but you have no clue if active is 1,2 or 3...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;my solution&lt;/strong&gt;: I have a wiki page and I tell each developer that each table must be there, with the schema and for each column the possible values with explanation.
I also generate the SQL server 2005 database diagram, but that is only marginally helpful since you have so many tables and so many lines connecting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a better way do document what a table is, what a column is and publishing it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note regarding answers:&lt;/em&gt;
Please don't answer this question thinking like an engineer! Answers like "if you have an extra table linked with a foreign key, then anyone can see the values" misses the point. 
A solution is good if:&lt;/p&gt;

A classic source of bugs is when you shift a literal to, say, mask off bits.

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this will get you into trouble because the mask will have all of its bits set because the value being shifted (~0) is signed, thus an arithmetic shift is performed. Instead, you'd want to force a logical shift by explicitly declaring the value as unsigned, i.e. by doing something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The code in my example was paraphrased from the Membership class, as written by the ASP.NET team themselves, so it was always safe to assume that the way it accesses the s_Initialized field is correct. Now we know why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: As Thomas Danecker points out, even though the access of the field is atomic, s_Initialized should really be marked &lt;em&gt;volatile&lt;/em&gt; to make sure that the locking isn't broken by the processor reordering the reads and writes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Task automation -&gt; Lee Holmes (a developer on the PowerShell team) posted a proof-of-concept called BgShell, which was basically the PowerShell runtime hosted in a windows forms app that listened for keystrokes and kicked off actions written in PowerShell based on them.  It also included some clipboard automation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quick access to the .NET framework.  You don't have to compile and run something or use another program like Snippet Compiler to test some functionality.  Load the assembly into your PowerShell session and interact with it.  You get all the discoverability of PowerShell (like Get-Member) to explore your object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to build domain specific languages.  James Kovacs wrote a simple build script language with PowerShell called Psake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can provide a scripting language for your application.  Since PowerShell is part of the 09 Common Engineering Criteria, a lot of Microsoft applications will have interfaces for PowerShell, and familiarity with the language syntax will grow.  You can leverage that knowledge by embedding the PowerShell runtime in your application and providing a scripting interface to your users, choosing what objects they will have access to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Along the same line, if you need to create a command-line interface for your application, PowerShell provides a large part of the underlying plumbing needed for parsing arguments, and other basic tasks, leaving only the business logic for you to write, and providing a consistent interface with other applications (for example, if you have user accounts that need to be managed (that don't already integrate with Active Directory, an admin could (using the Quest AD Cmdlets and your applications interface) Get-QADUser | New-MyApplicationUser and be done.  The Exchange 2007 team did this very well.  All the functionality is based on PowerShell cmdlets, the GUI calls the cmdlets and shows the user what is being run, so they can build scripts based off of that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's just cool!  In about 250 lines (including comments), Rob Foust and Jeff Hicks wrote a network sniffer in PowerShell.  Easier to use than WinDump for lightweight troubleshooting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community - There is a great community focused around PowerShell, including developers.  Find out more at PowerShellCommunity.org.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I need to do is bind a regular expression to a keyboard combination because I use this particular regex so often.&lt;/p&gt;

This inserts a literal newline (without ending the command) enabling me to put a newline into the expression and match across lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I bind this to a key combination?  &lt;/p&gt;

(i.e., if I reboot emacs and then type &lt;kbd&gt;M-x macro-name&lt;/kbd&gt;, and then &lt;kbd&gt;C-x e&lt;/kbd&gt;, I get a message in the minibuffer like 'no last kbd macro' or something similar)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Mike Stone - Thanks for the information.  I tried creating a macro like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;C-x( M-C-s ^.*Table\(\(.*C-q C-J\)*?GO\) C-x)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This created my macro, but when I executed my macro I didn't get the same highlighting that I ordinarily get when I use &lt;code&gt;isearch-forward-regexp&lt;/code&gt;.  Instead it just jumped to the end of the next match of the expression. So that doesn't really work for what I need. Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: It looks like I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; use macros to do what I want, I just have to think outside the box of &lt;code&gt;isearch-forward-regexp&lt;/code&gt;. I'll try what you suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During development you want to catch bad data/logic/code as early as possible to prevent problems either going unnoticed or resulting in later problems where the root cause is hard to track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In production handle problems as gracefully as possible. If something really is a non-recoverable error then handle it and present that information to the user. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example here's our code to Normalize a vector. If you feed it bad data in development it will scream, in production it returns a safety value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;inline const Vector3 Normalize( Vector3arg vec )

&lt;p&gt;This will execute the update.Action.Run() function on a seperate thread allocated from the thread pool. You can then keep checking the IAsyncResult until the update is complete, querying the update object for its progress after every check (because you can't have the other thread update the progress bar/UI), then calling Application.DoEvents(). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also are supposed to call EndInvoke() afterwards otherwise you may end up leaking resources&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When executing a macro, it's a little different... incremental searches will just happen once, and you will have to execute the macro again if you want to search again.  You can do more powerful and complex things though, such as search for a keyword, jump to the beginning of the line, mark, go to end of the line, M-w (to copy), then jump to another buffer, then C-y (paste), then jump back to the other buffer and end your macro.  Then, each time you execute the macro you will be copying a line to the next buffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The really cool thing about emacs macros is it will stop when it sees the bell... which happens when you fail to match an incremental search (among other things).  So the above macro, you can do C-u 1000 C-x e which will execute the macro 1000 times... but since you did a search, it will only copy 1000 lines, OR UNTIL THE SEARCH FAILS!  Which means if there are 100 matches, it will only execute the macro 100 times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Check out C-hf highlight-lines-matching-regexp which will show the help of a command that highlights everything matching a regex... I don't know how to undo the highlighting though... anyways you could use a stored macro to highlight all matching the regex, and then another macro to find the next one...?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FURTHER EDIT: M-x unhighlight-regexp will undo the highlighting, you have to enter the last regex though (but it defaults to the regex you used to highlight)&lt;/p&gt;

Amazingly enough it works pretty well.

&lt;p&gt;As noted before, I personally haven't noticed any system wide slow downs due to WinForms in applications written in both VB.NET and C#. However, if the application is truly performance intensive then you might notice a slight slow down if you wrote everything in C# due to it being complied into CIL (&lt;a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/han/hprls/orangepath/timestable-demo/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/han/hprls/orangepath/timestable-demo/&lt;/a&gt;). As such, writing the GUI in a language such as C# will likely make that part of the development a bit easier which would give you more time to work on the critical parts of the code. The only catch-22 here is might notice some slow downs due to the calls to the C/C++ code from the C# code; however, this is likely very unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If record processing is reasonably long-running, the difference will be negligible, so the simpler approach (1 record per thread) is probably the best.&lt;/p&gt;

The maximum number of running thread-pooled threads is limited per appdomain, so your piece of work may have to wait if they're all busy. It's called "queue user work item", after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two caveats, of course:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can change the maximum number of thread-pooled threads in code, at runtime, so there's nothing to stop you checking the current vs maximum number and upping the maximum if required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spinning up a new thread comes with its own time penalty - whether it's worthwhile for you to take the hit depends on your circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not yet.  Wait until you've done the conversion, and then find out where you're actually spending your time.  There's no reason to jump into mixing C/C++ with C# until you find out that it's necessary.  You may find that dropping into unsafe C# is sufficient.  Even that may be unnecessary.  You might just need to optimize algorithms.  Find out what your bottlenecks are and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; decide how to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;

For a quick string it is overkill, but if you're working with logs or large amounts, it may be just what you need. It works off a control file model similar to SQL*Loader (kind of the inspiration behind it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've all seen &lt;a href="http://www.svn-checkout.co.uk/images/10-how-to-create-efficient-branches-using-subversion/single_branch.png"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://coop.sigkill.com/~preed/people.mozilla.com/~preed/bloggity-blog-blog/release-branch-proposal.jpg"&gt;diagrams&lt;/a&gt; in various &lt;a href="http://www.grantusmaximus.com/web/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/svn-branch-example.gif"&gt;tutorials&lt;/a&gt;. Some good, some not so good. Can they be created automatically (or maybe with a little prodding -- you might have to tell it what if your branching philosophy is dev-test-prod, branch-per-release, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm looking at the TortoiseSVN &lt;a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/bsimser/WindowsLiveWriter/SubversionDaytoday_12266/image_21.png"&gt;Revision Graph&lt;/a&gt; right now, but it has more detail than I want and the wrong layout. I'm looking for something more like the images in &lt;a href="http://www.javalinux.it/wordpress/?p=32"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orion, thanks for the response. I guess since branching and merging are more a convention for managing files in a repository than a "built in feature of SVN, it would be pretty tough. I'll stick with the poorly-drawn diagram at the top of the whiteboard in our team's office.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, I can only presume this as the numbers listed in the profiler are way short of the maximum allowed (32mb on CE 5). Profiling a particular app with the RPM showed me that the total usage of all the caches only manages to get to about 12mb and then slowly shrinks as (I assume) something unmanaged starts to claim more memory.
The memory slider in System also shows that the device is very short on memory. If I kill the process the slider shows all the memory coming back. So it must (?) be this managed process that is swallowing the memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any simple(ish?) fashion how one can track unmanaged memory usage in some way that might enable me to match it up with the corresponding P/Invoke calls?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT: To all you re-taggers it isn't .NET&lt;/strong&gt;, tagging the question like this confuses things. It's .NETCF / Compact Framework. I know they appear to be similar but they're different because .NET rocks whereas CF is basically just a wrapper around NotImplementedException.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Validator Toolkit provides a set
  of validators for the new ASP.NET MVC
  framework to validate HTML forms on
  the client and server-side using
  validation sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm afraid that someone more MVC-savvy than me would have to speak to where in the architecture you should put things.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Actually, it may be better to check if the first char in the string is '\0':&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I almost mentioned that, but ended up leaving it out, since calling &lt;code&gt;strcmp()&lt;/code&gt; with the empty string and directly checking the first character in the string are both O(1).  You basically just pay for an extra function call, which is pretty cheap.  If you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need the absolute best speed, though, definitely go with a direct first-char-to-0 comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I always use &lt;code&gt;strlen() == 0&lt;/code&gt;, because I have &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; written a program where this was actually a measurable performance issue, and I think that's the most readable way to express the check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What sent me down this road of research was trying to publish files to a WSS 3.0 document library from a user's machine. I can't map a drive to the library in question because the WSS site is only available to authenticate via NTLM on a port other than 80 or 443. I suppose I could alternately use the WSS web services to push the files out, but I'm really curious about the answer to this question now.&lt;/p&gt;
