&lt;p&gt;My personal preference would be to utilize a prefix for instance variables both for clarity within functions and to prevent shadowing of function parameters. However I'm a fan of properties which rules out prefixes (unless you also prefix your property names, which doesn't work too well and looks daft). Similarly I could use the "self.variable" convention, but only if I make EVERYTHING a property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So given the code below what's your preferred naming style for instance/function variables? And if you don't bother, how do you deal with shadowing on function params?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;@interface GridItem : NSObject
{
    CGRect _rect;
    ...  
}
@end

-(void) initFromRect:(CGRect)rect
{
    _rect = rect;
    ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

What the author doesn't mention, though, is that &lt;code&gt;StringIO&lt;/code&gt; is just an "I."  There's no "O."  You &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; do this, for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;s = StringIO.new
s &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 'foo'
s &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 'bar'
s.to_s
# =&amp;gt; should be "foo\nbar"
# =&amp;gt; really is ''`
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby really needs a StringBuffer just like the one Java has. StringBuffers serve two important purposes. First, they let you test the output half of what Ruby's StringIO does. Second, they are useful for building up long strings from small parts -- something that Joel reminds us over and over again is otherwise very very slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a good replacement?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Mike Stone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's true that Strings in Ruby are mutable, but that doesn't mean we should always rely on that functionality.  If &lt;code&gt;stuff&lt;/code&gt; is large, the performance and memory requirements of this, for example, is really bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;result = stuff.map(&amp;amp;:to_s).join(' ')
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "correct" way to do this in Java is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;result = StringBuffer.new("")
for(String s : stuff) {
  result.append(s);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though my Java is a bit rusty.&lt;/p&gt;

Whoah!!!!! How did I miss that in the API?  I'm still not sure of the performance of StringIO, but at least it's now "Ruby's" problem, not mine :)&lt;/p&gt;

Look at which state is being protected by locks and then determine which state is under the protection of several locks. This will give you a sense of potential conflicts. Look at situations where code that holds a lock calls out to methods (don't forget virtual methods). Try to eliminate these calls where possible (by reducing the time the lock is held).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the list of mutexes that are held and a rough idea of the state that they protect, assign a locking order (i.e., mutex A should always be taken before mutex B). Try to enforce this in the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See if you can combine several locks into one if concurrency won't be adversely affected. For example, if mutex A and B seem like they might have deadlocks and an ordering scheme is not easily done, combine them to one lock initially.&lt;/p&gt;

I.e. your secondary thread will be trying to update the UI control, but the UI control will be waiting for a resource locked by the secondary thread to be released, so both threads end up waiting for each other to finish. As others have commented this situation is not unique to UI code, but is particularly common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other languages such as C++ you are free to try and do this (without an exception being thrown as in WinForms), but your application may freeze and stop responding should a deadlock occur.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, you can easily tell the UI thread that you want to update a control, just create a delegate, then call the (asynchronous) BeginInvoke method on that control passing it your delegate. E.g.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;myControl.BeginInvoke(myControl.UpdateFunction);

&lt;p&gt;The actual reason for this is probably (as Adam Haile states) some kind of concurrency/locky issue. 
Note that the normal .NET api (such as TextBox.Text = "Hello";) wraps SEND commands (that require immediate action) which can create issues if performed on separate thread from the one that actions the update. Using Invoke/BeginInvoke uses a POST instead which queues the action.&lt;/p&gt;

You can't assume that your program is the only one running.  When everyone is greedy with resources, the problem multiplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I prefer to create my threads manually and control them myself. It keeps the code very easy to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's fine when it's appropriate.  If you need a bunch of worker threads, though, all you've done is make your code more complicated.  Now you have to write code to manage them.  If you just used a thread pool, you'd get all the thread management for free.  And the thread pool provided by the language is very likely to be more robust, more efficient, and less buggy than whatever you roll for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Thread t = new Thread(new ThreadStart(DoSomething));  
t.Start();  
t.Join();  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that you would normally have some additional code in between &lt;code&gt;Start()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Join()&lt;/code&gt;.  Otherwise, the extra thread is useless, and you're wasting resources for no reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;People are way too afraid of the resources used by threads. I've never seen creating and starting a thread to take more than a millisecond. There is no hard limit on the number of threads you can create. RAM usage is minimal. Once you have a few hundred threads, CPU becomes an issue because of context switches, so at that point you might want to get fancy with your design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A millisecond is a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time on modern hardware.  That's 3 million cycles on a 3GHz machine.  And again, you aren't the only one creating threads.  Your threads compete for the CPU along with every other program's threads.  If you use not-quite-too-many threads, and so does another program, then together you've used too many threads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Seriously, don't make life more complex than it needs to be. Don't use the thread pool unless you need something very specific that it offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed.  Don't make life more complex.  If your program needs multiple worker threads, don't reinvent the wheel.  Use the thread pool.  That's why it's there.  Would you roll your own string class?&lt;/p&gt;

Integration tests are valuable, but typically are harder to write (and change) and run slower than Unit tests. Unit tests should be in total isolation and run quickly. I have a Java web app, written in Spring, that has about 1,000 Unit tests. It takes less than 10 seconds to run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next it depends on what kind of application you're testing. If it's something new, you're in luck because you can use the latest and greatest framework that was made with testing in mind. for example, if you're doing a Java web app, go with Spring MVC. Better yet, go with Spring MVC with 2.5 annotations. Even more test-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of listing the "pros" of Unit testing (they are very well documented elsewhere) here are some of the cons, in my personal experience:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you're using a legacy app it might be hard to shoehorn testing in there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's hard to get everybody on the team on the same page with testing. some don't see the value, some are lazy, and some just don't get it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you thought selling the developers on it was hard, try selling it on the business people who aren't developers but still need to make technology decisions. I don't care how good the team is, there is going to be some ramp-up time for unit testing and the business people may not want to pay for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a lot of teams decide to do integration testing to start, somehow thinking it is more valuable. it's not, I don't think it's less valuable but it's certainly not more valuable. as I said earlier, integration tests are slower to run and harder to write, and in my mind can be very frustrating to somebody new to writing tests. Start with REAL Unit testing, get the hand of it, and then move on to integration tests. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In my experience having an automated build that does unit testing can be a productivity killer. maybe we just weren't doing it correctly, but what would happen is that several times a day automated tests would be run. if one failed, everybody on the team would receive an email notification. so now it's Office Space where 10 different people are telling you to fix a bug. there's probably a better way to handle this, but in my experience it wasn't very valuable.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;@Derek, I don't exactly agree with the scenario you use as an example. If you don't know exactly what's running on your machine and exactly how many total threads, handles, CPU time, RAM, etc, that your app will use under a certain amount of load, you are in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you the only target customer for the programs you write?  If not, you can't be certain about most of that.  You generally have no idea when you write a program whether it will execute effectively solo, or if it will run on a webserver being hammered by a DDOS attack.  You can't know how much CPU time you are going to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming your program's behavior changes based on input, it's rare to even know exactly how much memory or CPU time your program will consume.  Sure, you should have a pretty good idea about how your program is going to behave, but most programs are never analyzed to determine exactly how much memory, how many handles, etc. will be used, because a full analysis is expensive.  If you aren't writing real-time software, the payoff isn't worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, claiming to know exactly how your program will behave is far-fetched, and claiming to know everything about the machine approaches ludicrous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And to be honest, if you don't know exactly what method you should use: manual threads, thread pool, delegates, and how to implement it to do just what your application needs, you are in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't fully disagree, but I don't really see how that's relevant.  This site is here specifically because programmers don't always have all the answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If your application is complex enough to require throttling the number of threads that you use, aren't you almost always going to want more control than what the framework gives you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No.  If I need a thread pool, I will use the one that's provided, unless and until I find that it is not sufficient.  I will not simply assume that the provided thread pool is insufficient for my needs without confirming that to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I'm not speaking as someone with only theoretical knowledge here. I write and maintain high volume applications that make heavy use of multithreading, and I generally don't find the thread pool to be the correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of my professional experience has been with multithreading and multiprocessing programs.  I have often needed to roll my own solution as well.  That doesn't mean that the thread pool isn't useful, or appropriate in many cases.  The thread pool is built to handle worker threads.  In cases where multiple worker threads are appropriate, the provided thread pool should should generally be the first approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither of us were arguing with the fact that if you have some specific requirements then the .NET ThreadPool might not be the right thing.  What we're objecting to is the trivialisation of the costs to the machine of creating a thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The significant expense of creating a thread at the raison d'etre for the ThreadPool in the first place.  I don't want my machines to be filled with code written by people who have been misinformed about the expense of creating a thread, and don't, for example, know that it causes a method to be called in every single DLL which is attached to the process (some of which will be created by 3rd parties), and which may well hot-up a load of code which need not be in RAM at all and almost certainly didn't need to be in L1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shape of the memory hierarchy in a modern machine means that 'distracting' a CPU is about the worst thing you can possibly do, and everybody who cares about their craft should work hard to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;

If you are running on a server then you are going to want to use one of the XML based office generation formats as there are know issues when &lt;a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/257757"&gt;using Office Automation on a server&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you are working on the client machine then you have a choice of either &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/default.aspx"&gt;using Office Automation&lt;/a&gt; or using the Office Open XML format (see links below), which is supported by Microsoft Office 2000 and up either natively or through service packs. One draw back to this though is that you might not be able to embed some kinds of graphs or images that you wish to show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to go about things will all depend sightly upon how much time you have to invest in development. If you go the route of Office Automation there are quite a few good tutorials out there that can be found via Google and is fairly simple to learn. However, the Open Office XML format is fairly new so you might find the learning curve to be a bit higher.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I think this is a brilliant question -
  and I think there is need of a better
  answer.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Surely the only reason is that there
  is something in a framework somewhere
  that isn't very thread-safe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That "something" is almost every single instance member on every single control in System.Windows.Forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MSDN documentation for many controls in System.Windows.Forms, if not all of them, say  &lt;em&gt;"Any public static (Shared in Visual Basic) members of this type are thread safe. Any instance members are not guaranteed to be thread safe."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that instance members such as &lt;code&gt;TextBox.Text {get; set;}&lt;/code&gt; are not &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;reentrant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making each of those instance members thread safe could introduce a lot of overhead that most applications do not need.  Instead the designers of the .Net framework decided, and I think correctly, that the burden of synchronizing access to forms controls from multiple threads should be put on the programmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Edit]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this question only asks "why" here is a link to an article that explains "how":&lt;/p&gt;

Host does all kinds of good stuff, but it needs to be able to accept input through the command line &lt;strong&gt;while it's running&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;./Host --blahblah 3 6 3 5

You could just parse through the arguments and call the correct method.
For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; int main(int argc, *argv[])
 {
     /*loop through each argument and take action*/
      while (--argc &amp;gt; 0)

&lt;p&gt;I think many developers think of the database as a simple persistence layer for their objects, and are only concerned with the CRUD operations that those objects need.  Too much effort is being put into the "impedence mismatch" between object and relational models.  Here's an idea: stop trying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write stored procedures to encapsulate your data.  Use results sets, DataSet, DataTable, SqlCommand (or the java/php/whatever equivalent) as needed from code to interact with the database.  You don't need those objects.  An excellent example is embedding a SqlDataSource into a .ASPX page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You shouldn't try to hide your data from anyone.  Developers need to understand exactly how and when they are interacting with the physical data store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Object-relational mappers are the devil.  Stop using them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building enterprise applications is often an exercise in managing complexity.  You have to keep things as simple as possible, or you will have an absolutely un-maintainable system.  If you are willing to allow some coupling (which is inherent in any application anyway), you can do away with both your business logic layer and your data access layer (replacing them with stored procedures), and you won't need any of those interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

                    }

            }
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in the main form we use the above code in these 3 events:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

{
    // Disable the sound when the program has focus
    WebClickSound.Enabled = false;
}


private void Form1_Deactivate(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Enable the sound when the program is out of focus
    WebClickSound.Enabled = true;
}


private void Form1_FormClosing(object sender, FormClosingEventArgs e)
{
    // Enable the sound on app exit
    WebClickSound.Enabled = true;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one problem I see currently is if the program crashes they won't have the click sound until they re-launch my application, but they wouldn't know to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IE6 has no support natively for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, IE has support for crazy custom javascript/css and COM objects (which is how they originally implemented XmlHttpRequest)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these hacks basically do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find all the png images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a directx image filter to load them and produce a transparent image in some kind of format IE understands&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;User fills out form and it is posted to /create&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use Async IO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless your request processing is complex and heavy, your program is going to spend 99% of it's time waiting for the HTTP requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what Async IO is designed for - Let the windows networking stack (or .net framework or whatever) worry about all the waiting, and just use a single thread to dispatch and 'pick up' the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the .NET framework makes it a right pain in the ass. It's easier if you're just using raw sockets or the Win32 api. Here's a (tested!) example using C#3 anyway:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;using System.Net; // need this somewhere

// need to declare an class so we can cast our state object back out
class RequestState {
    public WebRequest Request { get; set; }
}

static void Main( string[] args ) {
    // stupid cast neccessary to create the request
    HttpWebRequest request = WebRequest.Create( "http://www.stackoverflow.com" ) as HttpWebRequest;

    request.BeginGetResponse(
        /* callback to be invoked when finished */
        (asyncResult) =&amp;gt; { 
            // fetch the request object out of the AsyncState
            var state = (RequestState)asyncResult.AsyncState; 
            var webResponse = state.Request.EndGetResponse( asyncResult ) as HttpWebResponse;

            // there we go;
            Debug.Assert( webResponse.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.OK ); 

            Console.WriteLine( "Got Response from server:" + webResponse.Server );
        },
        /* pass the request through to our callback */
        new RequestState { Request = request }  
    );

    // blah
    Console.WriteLine( "Waiting for response. Press a key to quit" );
    Console.ReadKey();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of .NET, the 'completion callback' actually gets fired in a ThreadPool thread, not in your main thread, so you will still need to lock any shared resources, but it still saves you all the trouble of managing threads.&lt;/p&gt;

However, I still try to make them reasonably fast.  I think if they run on the order of milliseconds, you are fine.  If they run a second or more per test... then you might be doing something that should be optimized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slow tests only become a problem as the system matures and causes the build to take hours, at which point you are more likely running into an issue of a lot of kind of slow tests rather than one or 2 tests that you can optimize easily... thus you should probably pay attention RIGHT AWAY if you see lots of tests running hundreds of milliseconds each (or worse, seconds each), rather than wait till it gets to the hundreds of tests taking that long point (at which point it is going to be really hard to solve the problem).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, it will only reduce the time between when your automated build issues errors... which is ok if it is an hour later (or even a few hours later), I think.  The problem is running them before you check in, but this can be avoided by selecting a small subset of tests to run that are related to what you are working on.

&lt;p&gt;These are run automatically upon a successful build of our libraries on every engineers machine. We have more extensive (and time consuming) smoke-testing that is done by the build machine every night, or can be started manually on an engineers machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see we haven't yet reached the problem of tests being too time consuming. 10 seconds for me is the point where it starts to become intrusive, when we start to approach that it'll be something we'll take a look at. We'll likely move the lower level libraries, which are more robust since they change infrequently and have few dependencies, into the nightly builds, or a configuration where they're only executed by the build machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find it's taking more than a few seconds to run a hundred or so tests you may need to examine what you are classifying as a unit test and whether it would be better treated as a smoke test.&lt;/p&gt;

The B-Team handle things like configuration management, writing scripts, fixing lame bugs, and doing maintenance work - all the work that has strict procedures that have small consequences for failure. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Why is a code solution that works getting voted down? Sure, it's ugly and might not be the fastest way to do it, but it's more instructive that saying "strtol" or "sscanf". If you try it yourself you will learn something about how things happen under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't really think your solution should have been voted down, but my guess as to why it's happening is because it's less practical.  The idea with voting is that the "best" answer will float to the top, and while your answer might be more instructive about what happens under the hood (or a way it might happen), it's definitely not the best way to parse hex numbers in a production system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;"x=1 and y=abc and z=c4g and ..."
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some attributes have numeric values, some have alpha values, some have mixed, some have dates, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every string is &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to have "&lt;code&gt;x=someval and y=anotherval&lt;/code&gt;" at the beginning, but some don't.  I have three things I need to do.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Validate the strings to be certain that they have &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually parse the values for &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the rest of the string.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the example at the top, this would result in the following variables:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$x = 1;
$y = "abc";
$remainder = "z=c4g and ..."
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is: Is there a (reasonably) simple way to parse these &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; validate with a single regular expression?  i.e.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if ($str =~ /someexpression/)
{
    $x = $1;
    $y = $2;
    $remainder = $3;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the string may consist of &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; attributes.  This is a valid string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll post my solution as an answer, but it doesn't meet my single-regex preference.&lt;/p&gt;

This has served me for years and apparently gives me 80+ words per minute, but it does seem an incredibly weird way to type. This is touch typing but not using the "standard" finger arrangement. While it's probably not a great idea to try and fix something that already works, I thought I'd try and relearn to type the proper way (left fingers on asdf and right fingers on jkl;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been trying out Mavis Beacon and it seems alright, it slowly adds more and more letters to your repertoire allowing you to gain the muscle memory or whatever, and then focuses on speed. The "games" seem a little pointless (is this program designed for kids?), but I guess for someone who doesn't know where the keys are it does a good job showing you which fingers to use and where to move them. As I already knew where the keys are most of the program didn't really aid me. Once you know where the keys are you probably just want to practice typing out text and a program like that won't really aid any more than notepad apart from counting your words per minute and giving you something to type. I agree with Typing of the dead being pretty awesome though, and will definitely help with your speed once you've got the finger arrangement down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do all you touch typers use the standard finger arrangement or do you just do your own thing? I think I've come to the conclusion I'll just stick with what I know, it seems to work anyway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;unsigned int parseHex(const char * str)
{
    unsigned int val = 0;
    char c;

    while(c = *str++)
    {

        if (c &amp;gt;= '0' &amp;amp;&amp;amp; c &amp;lt;= '9')
        {
            val += c &amp;amp; 0x0F;
            continue;
        }

        c &amp;amp;= 0xDF;
        if (c &amp;gt;= 'A' &amp;amp;&amp;amp; c &amp;lt;= 'F')
        {
            val += (c &amp;amp; 0x07) + 9;
            continue;
        }

        errno = EINVAL;
        return 0;
    }

    return val;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it better to learn a scripting language like &lt;a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/" rel="nofollow" title="pgpool-II"&gt;Autohotkey&lt;/a&gt; first?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Edit: [Justin Standard]&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I think learning something macro-based like Autohotkey will only help minimally.  Try learning a "real" programming language first.  The easiest to get started with (according to most people) are &lt;a href="http://www.python.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;python&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" rel="nofollow"&gt;ruby&lt;/a&gt;.  I favor python, but both are pretty simple.
  There is also a &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4769/easiest-language-to-start-with#4856" rel="nofollow"&gt;full stackoverflow post&lt;/a&gt; that answers the question of which language to start with.&lt;/p&gt;

    return n &amp;lt; 0 ? ~rvs : rvs;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are two ways to use Automation (or OLE Automation) to
  programmatically control another application.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Late binding uses CreateObject to create and instance of the
  application object, which you can then control. For example, to create
  a new instance of Excel using late binding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; Dim oXL As Object
 Set oXL = CreateObject("Excel.Application")
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, to manipulate an existing instance of Excel (if
  Excel is already open) you would use GetObject (regardless whether
  you're using early or late binding):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; Dim oXL As Object
 Set oXL = GetObject(, "Excel.Application")
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;To use early binding, you first need to set a reference in your
  project to the application you want to manipulate. In the VB Editor of
  any Office application, or in VB itself, you do this by selecting
  Tools + References, and selecting the application you want from the
  list (e.g. Microsoft Excel 8.0 Object Library).&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;To create a new instance of Excel using early binding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; Dim oXL As Excel.Application
 Set oXL = New Excel.Application
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;In either case, incidentally, you can first try to get an existing
  instance of Excel, and if that returns an error, you can create a new
  instance in your error handler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;//early binding:
public create_a_foo(*args) {
 return new Foo(args)
}
my_foo = create_a_foo();

//late binding:
public create_something(Class klass, *args) {
  klass.new_instance(args)
}
my_foo = create_something(Foo);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first example, the compiler can do all sorts of neat stuff at compile time.  In the second, you just have to hope that whoever uses the method does so responsibly.  (Of course, newer JVMs support the &lt;code&gt;Class&amp;lt;? extends Foo&amp;gt; klass&lt;/code&gt; structure, which can greatly reduce this risk.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another benefit is that IDEs can hotlink to the class definition, since it's declared right there in the method.  The call to create&lt;em&gt;something(Foo) might be _very&lt;/em&gt; far from the method definition, and if you're looking at the method definition, it might be nice to see the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major advantage of late binding is that it makes things like inversion-of-control easier, as well as certain other uses of polymorphism and duck-typing (if your language supports such things).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# early binding:
def create_a_foo(*args)
  Foo.new(*args)
end
my_foo = create_a_foo

# late binding:
def create_something(klass, *args)
  klass.new(*args)
end
my_foo = create_something(Foo)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Ruby is (generally) not compiled, there isn't a compiler to do the nifty up-front stuff.  The growth of JRuby means that more Ruby is compiled these days, though, making it act more like Java, above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue with IDEs still stands: a platform like Eclipse can look up class definitions if you hard-code them, but cannot if you leave them up to the caller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inversion-of-control is not terribly popular in Ruby, probably because of its extreme runtime flexibility, but Rails makes great use of late binding to reduce the amount of configuration necessary to get your application going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Producing something like this, even just to recognize numbers, gets really hairy.  For example is "123.456" one number or two?  How about this "123,456"?  Is "35F" a decimal number and an 'F' or is it the hex value 0x35F?  You're going to have to build something that will parse in the way you need.  You can do this with regular expressions, or you can do it with &lt;code&gt;sscanf&lt;/code&gt;, or you can do it some other way, but you're going to have to write something custom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, with basic regular expressions, you can do this yourself.  It won't be magic, but it's not that much work.  Something like this will parse the lines you're interested in and consolidate them (Perl):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;my @vals = ();
while (defined(my $line = &amp;lt;&amp;gt;))
{

for (my $i = 0; $i &amp;lt; @vals; $i++)
{
    print $vals[$i];

    {
        print ",";
    }
}
print "}\n";
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JBOD - (just a bunch of disks) Old fashioned internal disks - fast but not very expandable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NAS - Slow but cheap and expandable, probably best for backups&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem you are encountering using Notepad++ is related to how git is launching the editor executable.  My solution to this is to set EDITOR to a batch file, rather than the actual editor executable, that does the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;start /WAIT "E:\PortableApps\Notepad++Portable\Notepad++Portable.exe" %*

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular
     expression pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as
     Perl&amp;nbsp;5. PCRE has its own native API, as well as a set of
     wrapper functions that correspond to the POSIX regular expression
     API. The PCRE library is free, even for building commercial
     software.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;PCRE was originally written for the
     &lt;a href="http://www.exim.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Exim MTA&lt;/a&gt;,
     but is now used by many high-profile open source projects, including
     &lt;a href="http://httpd.apache.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt;,
     &lt;a href="http://www.php.net/" rel="nofollow"&gt;PHP&lt;/a&gt;,

     &lt;a href="http://www.analog.cx/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Analog&lt;/a&gt;, and
     &lt;a href="http://nmap.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nmap&lt;/a&gt;.
     PCRE has also found its way into some well known commercial products, like
     &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Apple Safari&lt;/a&gt;.
     Some other interesting projects using PCRE include
     &lt;a href="http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Chicken&lt;/a&gt;,
     &lt;a href="http://www.ferite.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ferite&lt;/a&gt;,

     and &lt;a href="http://www.wenlin.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wenlin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PCRE is mature, and has the support of numerous projects.  Apache and Apple both have a vested interest in making it high-quality.  I doubt that any other RE library is likely to surpass it in both functionality and quality (or possibly either) anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

The clients of the RemotingService are ASP.NET instances (many many).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the clients remoting call RemotingService and blocks while the RemotingService call is serviced. However, the remoting service is getting complicated enough (with more RPC calls and complex algorithms) that the asp.net worker threads are blocked for a significantly long time (4-5 seconds).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc164128.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;this msdn article&lt;/a&gt;, doing this will not scale well because an asp.net worker thread is blocked for each remoting RPC. It advises switching to async handlers to free up asp.net worker threads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The purpose of an asynchronous handler
  is to free up an ASP.NET thread pool
  thread to service additional requests
  while the handler is processing the
  original request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems fine, except the remoting call still takes up a thread from the thread pool.
Is this the same thread pool as the asp.net worker threads? &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;PT_ATTACH  to pick a process to debug&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PT_DENY_ATTACH  so processes can stop themselves from being debugged&lt;br /&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;No mention of reading or writing memory or registers. Which would have been discouraging if the man page had not also mentioned PT_GETREGS, PT_SETREGS, PT_GETFPREGS, and PT_SETFPREGS in the error codes section. So, I checked ptrace.h. There I found:&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PT_READ_I  to read instruction words&lt;/li&gt;

What I am curious about is when it is time to write unit tests... I will write them to cover as many sets of classes as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if I have a Word class, I will write some unit tests for the Word class.  Then, I begin writing my Sentence class, and when it needs to interact with the Word class, I will often write my unit tests such that they test both Sentence and Word... at least in the places where they interact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have these tests essentially become integration tests because they now test the integration of these 2 classes?  Or is it just a unit test that spans 2 classes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, because of this uncertain line, I will rarely actually write integration tests... or is my using the finished product to see if all the pieces work properly the actual integration tests, even though they are manual and rarely repeated beyond the scope of each individual feature?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I misunderstanding integration tests, or is there really just very little difference between integration and unit tests?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT:  Thanks for all the great responses everyone!  I think from the varied answers it's clear that the line between unit and integration tests is definitely a blurry line, and perhaps it's a bit pedantic to try and figure out which are which and the true focus should stay on the code (Thanks @Rob Cooper).  Also, sorry but I'm not going to accept any answer because too many are too good, and it really seems quite subjective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically you cannot unit test just-one-class anyway. What if your class is composed with several other classes? Does that automatically make it an integration test? I don't think so.&lt;/p&gt;

My point of view:
For me an integration test is the test of the whole part, not if two parts out of ten are going together.
Our integration test shows, if the master build (containing 40 projects) will succeed.
For the projects we have tons of unit tests.
The most important thing concerning unit tests for me is, that one unit test must not be dependent on another unit test. So for me both test you describe above are unit tests, if they are independent. For integration tests this need not to be important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would suggest that you would be better served to control access to your servers both physically and over the network using a firewall and a private network bubble, and store the passwords in the clear (or base-64 encoded) on disk with permissions locked down to the run user for your web app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, see if there is another API call to determine exit status... a quick glance and I don't see one, but I am not well versed in the standard C API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An easy alternative is to have a global variable that stores the exit status... the default being an unknown error cause (for if the program terminates abnormally).  Then, when you call exit, you can store the exit status in the global and retrieve it from any atexit functions.  This requires storing the exit status diligently before every exit call, and clearly is not ideal, but if there is no API and you don't want to risk &lt;code&gt;on_exit&lt;/code&gt; not being on the platform... it might be the only option.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What about using source control on your own computer, if you're the sole programmer? Is this good practice? Are there related tips or tricks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find git is actually easier for this as you don't need a server or worry about entering URL's and so on. Your version-control stuff just lives in the &lt;code&gt;.git&lt;/code&gt; directory inside your project and you just go ahead and use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 second intro (assuming you have installed it)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd myproject
git init
git add * # add all the files
git commit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time you do some changes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add newfile1 newfile2 # if you've made any new files since last time
git commit -a
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as you're doing that, git has your back. If you mess up, your code is safe in the nice git repository. It's awesome&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note: You may find getting things OUT of git a bit harder than getting them in, but it's far more preferable to have that problem than to not have the files at all!&lt;/li&gt;

I expect that it isn't set yet at the point when &lt;code&gt;atexit()&lt;/code&gt; is called, anyway.  By this I mean that the runtime knows what it is, but probably hasn't reported it to the OS.  This is pretty much just conjecture, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like you will either need to use &lt;code&gt;on_exit()&lt;/code&gt; or structure your program so that the exit code doesn't matter.  It would not be unreasonable to have the last statement in your main function flip a global &lt;code&gt;exited_cleanly&lt;/code&gt; variable to true.  In the function you register with &lt;code&gt;atexit()&lt;/code&gt;, you could check this variable to determine how the program exited.  This will only give you two states, but I expect that would be sufficient for most needs.  You could also expand this type of scheme to support more exit states if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can catch unhandled exceptions in the Error event of the page, but I can't get the reference to the UserControl that caused the exception so I could hide just that control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if I could get that information somehow through the stack trace (which would be awful way to do it) the execution of the Page is halted and no subsequent controls would render.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe someone knows how DotNetNuke handles that, because this is a similar solution...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Website projects are simple, in that all files added to the project folders are automatically compiled and included, which was supposedly added to make it more palatable to classic ASP and PHP developers. Once benefit is that it includes build providers, which allow for certain actions to be associated with a filetype - that's how the first release of SubSonic would rebuild the data access layer when you added a .abp file to the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web Application Projects are a lot more flexible, though. For instance, all class libraries in a Website Project need to be in the App_Code folder, which is frustrating in a complex application. There are a lot of scenarios which just don't work for a Website Project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can convert from one to another, although if you're unsure I'd recommend just starting with a Web Application.&lt;/p&gt;

Part of this refactoring, has been to move code that's common to two of my models to a module that I can include where I need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, so good. Looks like it's going to work out, but I've just hit a problem that I'm not sure how to get around.  The module (which I've called sendable), is just going to be the code that handles faxing, e-mailing, or printing a PDF of the document.  So, for example, I have a purchase order, and I have Internal Sales Orders (imaginatively abbreviated to ISO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem I've struck, is that I want some variables initialised (initialized for people who don't spell correctly :P ) after the object is loaded, so I've been using the &lt;strong&gt;after_initialize&lt;/strong&gt; hook. No problem... until I start adding some more mixins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem I have, is that I can have an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;after_initialize&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in any one of my mixins, so I need to include a &lt;strong&gt;super&lt;/strong&gt; call at the start to make sure the other mixin &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;after_initialize&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; calls get called.  Which is great, until I end up calling super and I get an error because there is no super to call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a little example, in case I haven't been confusing enough:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Iso &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  include Shared::TracksSerialNumberExtension
  include Shared::OrderLines
  extend  Shared::Filtered
  include Sendable::Model

  validates_presence_of   :customer
  validates_associated    :lines

  owned_by                :customer
  order_lines             :despatched # Mixin

  tracks_serial_numbers   :items  # Mixin

  sendable :customer                      # Mixin

  attr_accessor :address

  def initialize( params = nil )
    super
    self.created_at ||= Time.now.to_date
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if each one of the mixins have an after_initialize call, with a &lt;strong&gt;super&lt;/strong&gt; call, how can I stop that last &lt;strong&gt;super&lt;/strong&gt; call from raising the error? How can I test that the super method exists before I call it?&lt;/p&gt;

I am still pretty fresh when it comes to custom controls etc, but here are my thoughts (feel free to comment/correct people!).. (I am kinda thinking/writing out loud here!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If an error occurs during rendering, in some cases, would it not be too late? (since some of the controls HTML may have already been sent to the Writer and output).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, would it not be best to wrap the user control's Render method, but rather than passing it the reference to the "Live" HtmlTextWriter, you pass your own, trap any Exceptions raised in this little safety "bubble", if all goes well, you then pass your resultant HTML to the actual HtmlTextWriter?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This logic could probably be slung to a generic wrapper class which you would use to dynamically load/render the controls at run time..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If any errors do occur, you have all the information you need at your disposal! (i.e control references etc).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just my thoughts, flame away! :D ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was always told that &lt;strong&gt;Unit Tests&lt;/strong&gt; is the testing of an &lt;em&gt;individual component&lt;/em&gt; - which should be exercised to its fullest. Now, this tends to have many levels, since most components are made of smaller parts. For me, a &lt;em&gt;unit&lt;/em&gt; is a functional part of the system. So it has to provide something of value (i.e. not a method for string parsing, but a &lt;em&gt;HtmlSanitizer&lt;/em&gt; perhaps).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration Tests&lt;/strong&gt; is the next step up, its taking one or more components and making sure they work together as they should.. You are then above the intricacies of worry about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; the components work individually, but when you enter html into your &lt;em&gt;HtmlEditControl&lt;/em&gt; , it somehow magically knows wether its valid or not..&lt;/p&gt;

Cursors are an incredibly useful mechanism and tbh, saying things like "if you use a cursor we fire you" is a little ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, you only want to keep a cursor open for the absolute minimum that is required. Specifying a maximum time would be arbitrary and pointless without understanding the problem domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One viewpoint is that the data layer should be aware of business objects (our own classes that represent an entity), and be able to work with that object natively.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opposing viewpoint is that the data layer should be object-agnostic, and purely handle simple data types (strings, bools, dates, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see that both approaches may be valid, but my own viewpoint is that I prefer the former.  That way, if the data storage medium changes, the business layer doesn't (necessarily) have to change to accommodate the new data layer.  It would therefore be a trivial thing to change from a SQL data store to a serialized xml filesystem store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My colleague's point of view is that the data layer shouldn't have to know about object definitions, and that as long as the data is passed about appropriately, that is enough.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I know that this is one of those questions that has the potential to start a religious war, but I'd appreciate any feedback from the community on how you approach such things.  &lt;/p&gt;

That is, whenever I want to return a list of objects from my data layer, I get the caller to pass in the list. So instead of this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public IList&amp;lt;Foo&amp;gt; GetFoosById(int id) { ... }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public void GetFoosById(IList&amp;lt;Foo&amp;gt; foos, int id) { ... }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lets me pass in a plain old List if that's all I need, or a more intelligent implementation of IList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; (like ObservableCollection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;) if I plan to bind to it from the UI. This technique also lets me return stuff from the method like a ValidationResult containing an error message if one occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This still means that my data layer knows about my object definitions, but it gives me one extra degree of flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that I think it's good practise to de-couple data and logic as much as possible, but that isn't always practical.  A pure separation between logic and data access makes joins and optimisations difficult, which is what makes Linq so powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

Say that I have a view which can accept drag and drop, but only in certain areas. Once the user drags over one of these areas I call &lt;code&gt;DragManager.acceptDrag(this)&lt;/code&gt; (from a &lt;code&gt;DragEvent.DRAG_OVER&lt;/code&gt; handler), but if the user then moves out of this area I'd like to change the status of the drag to not accepted and show the &lt;code&gt;DragManager.NONE&lt;/code&gt; feedback. However, neither calling &lt;code&gt;DragManager.acceptDrag(null)&lt;/code&gt; nor &lt;code&gt;DragManager.showFeedback(DragManager.NONE)&lt;/code&gt; seems to have any effect. Once I've accepted the drag an set the feedback type I can't seem to change it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to make it clear: the areas where the user should be able to drop are not components or even display objects, in fact they are just ranges in the text of a text field (like the selection). Had they been components of their own I could have solved it by making each of them accept drag events individually. I guess I could create proxy components that float over the text to emulate it, but I'd rather not if it isn't necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've managed to get it working in both AIR and the browser now, but only by putting proxy components on top of the ranges of text where you should be able to drop things. That way I get the right feedback and drops are automatically unaccepted on drag exit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the oddest thing about D&amp;amp;D in AIR:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;DragManager.doDrag(initiator, source, event, dragImage, offsetX, offsetY);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In browser-based Flex, &lt;code&gt;offsetX&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;offsetY&lt;/code&gt; should be negative (so says the documentation, and it works fine). However, when running &lt;em&gt;exactly the same code&lt;/em&gt; in AIR you have to make the offsets positive. The same numbers, but positive. That is very, very weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've tested some more and what &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10870/how-can-i-unaccept-a-drag-in-flex#11209"&gt;@maclema&lt;/a&gt; works, but not if you run in AIR. It seems like drag and drop in AIR is different. It's really, really weird because not only is the feedback not showing correctly, and it's not possible to unaccept, but the coordinates are also completely off. I just tried my application in a browser instead of AIR and dragging and dropping is completely broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, skipping the &lt;code&gt;dragEnter&lt;/code&gt; handler works fine in AIR, but breaks everything when running in a browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;link with "/NODEFAULTIB /verbose" and trace all unresolveds in the output of the previous step and add the libraries 1 by 1. &lt;/li&gt;

Thanks for the comments. That's an interesting idea that might work, but it requires that each UserControl implements some additional logic, and it is not under my control.

Interop with C++ code is hugely simplified by refactoring non-UI code into class libraries using C++/CLI (as you've noted in your selection of tags).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only issue with WPF is that it may be hard to maintain the current look-and-feel. Moving to WinForms can be done while maintaining the current look of your GUI. WPF uses such a different model that to attempt to keep the current layout would probably be futile and would definitely not be in the spirit of WPF. WPF also apparently has poor performance on pre-Vista machines when more than one WPF process is running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My suggestion is to find out what your clients are using. If most have moved to Vista and your team is prepared to put in a lot of GUI work, I would say skip WinForms and move to WPF. Otherwise, definitely look seriously at WinForms. In either case, a class library in C++/CLI is the answer to your interop concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

I could go to my Plan object, which was a property of my AcceptedPlan class to read the plan's details. My problem arose when I had to start inserting new rows to the details table. From my reading, it seems the only way to create a new child object is to add it to the parent object and then save the session. But I don't want to have to create a new parent Plan object every time I want to create a new detail record. This seems like unnecessary overhead. Does anyone know if I am going about this in the wrong way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of variables that govern it, such as the size of each row and the number of writes vs reads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically: high fill factor = quicker read, low = quicker write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However it's not quite that simple, as almost all writes will be to a subset of rows that need to be looked up first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance: set a fill factor to 10% and each single-row update will take 10 times as long to find the row it's changing, even though a page split would then be very unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally you see fill factors 70% (very high write) to 95% (very high read).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a bit of an art form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that a good way of thinking of fill factors is as pages in an address book - the more tightly you pack the addresses the harder it is to change them, but the slimmer the book.

&lt;p&gt;Integration tests are those tests where multiple classes and their interactions are tested at the same time. Only some dependencies in these cases are faked/mocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't call Controller's integration tests unless one of their dependencies is a real one (i.e. not faked) (e.g. IFormsAuthentication).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separating the two types of tests is useful for testing the system at different levels. Also, integration tests tend to be long lived, and unit tests are supposed to be quick. The execution speed distinction means they're executed differently. In our dev processes, unit tests are run at check-in (which is fine cos they're super quick), and integration tests are run once/twice per day. I try and run integration tests as often as possible, but usually hitting the database/writing to files/making rpc's/etc slows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That raises another important point, unit tests should avoid hitting IO (e.g. disk, network, db). Otherwise they slow down alot. It takes a bit of effort to design these IO dependencies out - i can't admit I've been faithful to the "unit tests must be fast" rule, but if you are, the benefits on a much larger system become apparent very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

To make a really long story short I am getting XML from a webservice of serialized objects.  I have a page limit of how many things can be on a page.  I've taken a data grid and made it page, sort across pages, and handle some basic filtering.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In regards to paging I'm using a Dictionary keyed on the page and storing the XML for that page.  This way whenever a user comes back to a page that I've saved into this dictionary I can grab the XML from local memory instead of hitting the webservice.  Basically, I'm caching the data retrieved from each call to the webservice for a page of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several things that can expire my cache.  Filtering and sorting are the main reason.  However, a user may edit a row of data in the grid by opening an editor.  The data they edit could cause the data displayed in the row to be stale.  I could easily go to the webservice and get the whole page of data, but since the page size is set at runtime I could be looking at a large amount of records to retrieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me now get to the heart of the issue that I am experiencing.  In order to prevent getting the whole page of data back I make a call to the webservice asking for the completely updated record (the editor handles saving its data).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I'm using custom objects I need to serialize them on the server to XML (this is handled already for other portions of our software).  All data is handled through XML in e4x.  The cache in the Dictionary is stored as an XMLList.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let me show you my code...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var idOfReplacee:String = this._WebService.GetSingleModelXml.lastResult.*[0].*[0].@Id;
var xmlToReplace:XMLList = this._DataPages[this._Options.PageIndex].Data.(@Id == idOfReplacee);

if(xmlToReplace.length() &amp;gt; 0)
{
    delete (this._DataPages[this._Options.PageIndex].Data.(@Id == idOfReplacee)[0]);
    this._DataPages[this._Options.PageIndex].Data += this._WebService.GetSingleModelXml.lastResult.*[0].*[0];
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, I get the id of the node I want to replace.  Then I find it in the cache's Data property (XMLList).  I make sure it exists since the filter on the second line returns the XMLList.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem I have is with the delete line.  I cannot make that line delete that node from the list.  The line following the delete line works.  I've added the node to the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I replace or delete that node (meaning the node that I find from the filter statement out of the .Data property of the cache)???&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully the underscores for all of my variables do not stay escaped when this is posted! otherwise this.&amp;amp;#95 == this._&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know (also using C# stack myself), but self-hosted web-based SVN client market is such a small niche that even offering in different language could be considered good enough. MySQL doesn't bite and installation of Ruby is pretty much x-copy command. I understand why you don't want to spoil your server with additional software though, but if are OK to host your SVN repositories with third-party, you get nice web-based interface without maintenance hassles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm using &lt;a href="http://unfuddled.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;a href="http://unfuddled.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://unfuddled.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (they also have some basic API to hook up on if needed)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Not to promote reinventing the wheel,
  but I originally wrote my own web SVN
  browser by using the &lt;strong&gt;svn log --xml&lt;/strong&gt;
  command&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is actually good idea. I'm also parsing some xml formatted output during my automated build process but creating own full-blown SVN browser is kind of overkill because now you have to maintain not one primary project, but also the tool. But then again, we, programmers, love to create tools that will make working on our primary projects easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ASP.NET SVN browser sounds like promising open-source idea, anybody willing to start work on it? I would contribute.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customer object contains an ICollection &amp;lt;PaymentPlan&amp;gt; PaymentPlans which represent the plans that customer has accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PaymentPlan to the Customer would be mapped using a bag which uses the details table to establish which customer id's mapped to which PaymentPlans.  Using cascade all-delete-orphan, if the customer was deleted, both the entries from details and the PaymentPlans that customer owned would be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PaymentPlan object contains a PlanTerms object which represented the terms of the payment plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PlanTerms would be mapped to a PaymentPlan using a many-to-one mapping cascading save-update which would just insert a reference to the relevant PlanTerms object in to the PaymentPlan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this model, you could create PlanTerms independantly and then when you add a new PaymentPlan to a customer, you'd create a new PaymentPlan object passing in the relevant PlanTerms object and then add it to the collection on the relevant Customer.  Finally you'd save the Customer and let nhibernate cascade the save operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'd end up with a Customer object, a PaymentPlan object and a PlanTerms object with the Customer (customer table) owning instances of PaymentPlans (the details table) which all adhear to specific PlanTerms (the plan table).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've got some more concrete examples of the mapping syntax if required but it's probably best to work it through with your own model and I don't have enough information on the database tables to provide any specific examples.&lt;/p&gt;

Currently we're running XP/2000, but I can see a desire to move up to Vista soon.&lt;/p&gt;

A big driver for our strategy was to eliminate as much risk and uncertainty as we could, which meant avoiding The Big Rewrite. As we all know, TBR fails most of the time. So we chose an incremental approach that allows us to preserve modules that won't be changing in the current release, writing new features managed, andporting features that are getting enhancements to managed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do this several ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Host WPF content on your MFC views (see &lt;a href="http://www.codeguru.com/cpp/cpp/cpp_managed/interop/article.php/c14589" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For MFC MDI apps, create a new WinForms framework and host your MFC MDI views (see &lt;a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/miscctrl/HostMFC.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Host WinForms user controls in MFC Dialogs and Views (see &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ahdd1h97.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with adopting WPF (option 1) is that it will require you to rewrite all of your UI at once, otherwise it'll look pretty schizophrenic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second approach looks viable but very complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third approach is the one we selected and it's been working very well.  It allows you to selectively refresh areas of your app while maintaining overall consistency and not touching things that aren't broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Visual C++ 2008 Feature Pack looks interesting, I haven't played with it though. Seems like it might help with your issue of outdated look. If the "ribbon" would be too jarring for your users you could look at third-party MFC and/or WinForms control vendors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My overall recommendation is that interop + incremental change is definitely preferable to sweeping changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading your follow-up, I can definitely confirm that the productivity gains of the framework vastly outweigh the investment in learning it. Nobody on our team had used C# at the start of this effort and now we all prefer it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that not all platforms implement their stacks in the same direction, so you might want to do a one-off test when the app starts to verify which way the stack grows..  Or do some fudge:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general on a *nix environment, you always want to err on giving away as little permissions as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

Because each test essentially wanted to verify that for a given bit of input code (which happens to be a C++ header) I'd get a given bit of outputted code I wrote a small engine that reads test definitions from XML input files and generates test cases from these expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

If you write some custom cloning code and have to manually implement that in each cloneable type then you should really test the cloning of each one of those types.  Alternatively, if you decide to go a more generic route (where the aforementioned reflection would likely fit in), your tests would only need to test the specific scenarios that you cloning system will have to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer your specific questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Do you write (or rewrite once you discover the need for the clone) all your unit tests for the class so that they can be invoked with either a 'virgin' object or with a clone of it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should have tests for all the methods that can be performed on both the original and cloned objects.  Note that it should be pretty easy to set up a simple test design to support this without manually updating the logic for each test.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;How would you test if part of the cloning wasn't deep enough - as this is just the kind of problem which can give hideous-to-find bugs later?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It depends on the cloning method you choose.  If you have to manually update the cloneable types then you should test that each type is cloning all (and only) the members you expect.  Whereas, if you are testing a cloning framework I would create some test cloneable types to test each scenario you need to support.&lt;/p&gt;

look to be fairly similar, but adapted for slightly different uses. Both of these have a binary component, so you'll need an extra project in your solution to compile and run the tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The framework we use is &lt;a href="http://cxxtest.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow"&gt;CxxTest&lt;/a&gt;, which is much lighter; it's headers only, and uses a Perl (!) script to scrape test suite information from your headers (suites inherit from CxxTest::Base, all your test methods' names start with "test"). Obviously, this requires that you get Perl from &lt;a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/activeperl/index.mhtml" rel="nofollow"&gt;one source&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.cygwin.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;another&lt;/a&gt;, which adds overhead to your build environment setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Work (changes pended)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[edit] OK looks like you rephrased this part of the question.  Yes, Jeff's right, VS decides to check some files out "for you," like sln and proj files.  It also automatically checks out any source file that you edit (that's what you want though, right? although you can change that setting in tools &gt; options &gt; source control)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proxy apparently takes a while to get ramped up (we don't use it) but once it has cached most of the tree it's supposed to be pretty quick. Can you do some monitoring and find the bottleneck(s)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rolled my own "Cache", because I didn't know any better, it looked a bit like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class DataManager
{

      private static DataManager s_instance;

      public static DataManager GetInstance()
      {
      }

      private Data[] m_myData;
      private DataTime m_cacheTime;

      public Data[] GetData()
      {
            TimeSpan span = DateTime.Now.Substract(m_cacheTime);

            if(span.TotalSeconds &amp;gt; 10)
            {
                  // Do SQL to get data
                  m_myData = data;
                  m_cacheTime = DateTime.Now;
                  return m_myData;     
            }

            {
                  return m_myData;
            }
      }

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the values are stored for a while in a singleton, and when the time expires, the values are renewed. If time has not expired, and a request for the data is done, the stored values in the field are returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has had a team of engineers working on it and they've probably managed to squeeze much more performance out of the system than would be possible for you to.

Same thing with Customers. The fact that the objects are a child of each other is what causes your problem, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, what makes your AcceptedOffer complex is it has a two responsibilities: it indicates offers included in a plan, it indicates acceptance by a customer. That violates the Single Responsibility Principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have to differentiate between an Offer that is under a Plan, and an Offer that is accepted by customers. So here's what I'm going to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a separate Offer object which does not have a state, e.g., it does not have a customer and it does not have a status -- it only has an OfferId and the Plan it belongs to as its attributes. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modify your Plan object to have an Offers collection (it does not have to have accepted offer in its context). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, modify your AcceptedOffer object so that it contains an Offer, the Customer, and a Status. Customer remains the same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this will sufficiently untangle your NHibernate mappings and object saving problems. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish to design a workflow host environment that has high availability - a minimum of 2 WF runtime hosts on separate hardware both pointing to the same persistance or tracking SQL database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am looking for a pattern whereby I can asynchronously create new workflow instances based on some external event (i.e. some piece of data is updated in DB by a different application). For each event I need to create exactly one workflow instance and doesn't matter which host that instance is created on. There is also some flexibility regarding the duration of time between the event and when the workflow instance is actually created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One solution I am considering is having a WCF interface on the WF hosts and placing them behind some sort of load balancer. It would then be up to whatever part of the system that is firing the "event" to make the WCF call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not really happy with this because if both\all WF hosts are down, or otherwise unavailable, the event could be "lost". Also, I won't be able manage load the way I would like to. I envisage a situation where there may be lots of events in a small period of time, but it's perfectly acceptable to handle those events some time later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I reckon I need to persist the events somehow and decouple the event creation from the event handling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is putting these events into MSMQ, or a simple event table in SQL Server, and having the WF host just poll the queue periodically a viable solution? Polling seems to be a such a dirty word though...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would NServiceBus and durable messaging be useful here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any insights would be much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addendum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The database will be clustered with shared fiber channel storage. The network will also be redundant. In order for WF runtime instances to have fail-over they must point at a common persistence service, which in this case is a SQL backend. It's high availability, not Total Availabilty :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, each instance of the WF runtime must be running exactly the same bits, so upgrading will require taking them all down at the same time. I like the idea of being able to do that, if required, without taking the whole system down.&lt;/p&gt;

Though this had several disadvantages when connecting code to the controls, it probably means that you could have a similar setup by building some designer classes. I have never myself written any designer classes in VS, so I can't say how to or if its worth it :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for "preferred", that always tends to ruffle feathers at times, but there are more and more .NET developers wanted for the web and the desktop at the job hunt sites I tend to visit. 8^D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Many thanks to Orion for pointing out my confusion on the frameworks. You get 3.0 "out the gate if you're on XP SP2 or Vista. Everything else is going to require a simple download or run of Windows Update.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I guess what I'm trying to say is that
  when I look at system requirements for
  certain software I rarely ever see the
  .NET Framework as being a requirement.
  So, I always wonder how they get by
  without it being a requirement (if
  they developed the software in .NET).
  So, I just assume that most commercial
  software is not written in .NET so
  that's why I'm asking this question.
  Hope that cleared some things up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't have any numbers, but I'm going to guess that since the majority of folks out there are running XP and Vista on their desktops, listing the .NET framework is moot, especially if they are targeting the 2.0 framework in the application itself. Back in the day, how many applications did you see that said "requires vbrun50.dll" or something to that regard since it was put into the Windows installs by default?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus it is a little less "scary" for those that aren't terribly computer saavy.

&lt;p&gt;What I've found to be most helpful is to have a regular output to a text log file.  For example you can print the output of &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa908760.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;GlobalMemoryStatus&lt;/a&gt;  every couple of minutes along with logging every time you load a new form.  From there you can at least see that either memory gradually erodes, or a huge chunks of memory disappeared at specific times of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us, we found a gradual memory loss all day as long as the device was being used.  From there we eventually found that the barcode scanning device was being initialized for no particular reason in our Form base class (I blame the previous developer!  :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up this logging may be a small hassle, but for us it paid huge dividends in the long run especially with the device in live use we can get real data, instrumentation, stack traces from exceptions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, I have Google'd this and already expecting a big fat &lt;strong&gt;NO!!&lt;/strong&gt; But I thought I should ask since I know sometimes there can be the odd little gem of knowledge lurking around in peoples heads ^_^&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am working my way through some excercises in a book for study, and this particular exercise is User Controls. I have cobbled together a control and would like to set the DefaultEvent for it (having done this for previous controls) so when I double-click it, the default event created is whatever I specify it to be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a standard User Control (.ascx), &lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt; a custom rendered control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Current Code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the class &amp;amp; event definition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[System.ComponentModel.DefaultEvent("OKClicked")]
public partial class AddressBox : System.Web.UI.UserControl
{
    public event EventHandler OKClicked;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Current Result&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, when I double click the the control when it is on a ASPX page, the following is created:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    protected void AddressBox1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {

    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not quite what I was expecting! So, my question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Is it possible to define a DefaultEvent for a UserControl? Is it a hack? If it's [not] supported, is there a reason?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Side Note&lt;/strong&gt;: How do we put underscores in code? I cant seem to put and escape char in?&lt;/p&gt;

The vendor project gathers several header files into one monolithic header file, which is then &lt;code&gt;#include&lt;/code&gt;d by the vendor sources.  But the make rule that builds the monolithic header accidentally included the generated &lt;code&gt;config.h&lt;/code&gt;.  The presence of the PACKAGE, VERSION, etc. config variables in the monolithic header is what was causing the redefinition warnings.  It turns out that the vendor's &lt;code&gt;config.h&lt;/code&gt; was irrelevant, because "config.h" always resolved to &lt;code&gt;$(top_builddir)/config.h&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe this is the way it's supposed to work.  By default a subproject should be including the enclosing project's &lt;code&gt;config.h&lt;/code&gt; instead of its own, unless the subproject explicitly includes its own, or manipulates the INCLUDE path so that its own directory comes before &lt;code&gt;$(top_builddir)&lt;/code&gt;, or otherwise manipulates the header files as in my case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two or more object collections of different types. You want to combine them into a single sortable and filterable collection (withing having to manually implement sort or filter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the approaches I've considered is to create a new object collection with only a few core properties, including the ones that I would want the collection sorted on, and an object instance of each type. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class MyCompositeObject
{
    enum           ObjectType;
    DateTime       CreatedDate;
    string         SomeAttribute;
    myObjectType1  Obj1;
    myObjectType2  Obj2;
{
class MyCompositeObjects : List&amp;lt;MyCompositeObject&amp;gt; { }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then loop through my two object collectiosn to build the new composite collection. Obviously this is a bit of a brute force method, but it would work. I'd get all the default view sorting and filtering behavior on my new composite object collection, and I'd be able to put a data template on it to display my list items properly depending on which type is actually stored in that composite item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What suggestions are there for doing this in a more elegant way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it's not any faster than page output caching. However, with MVC, you really can't use page output caching via the @OutputCache directive in MVC because we render the view (aka page) &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; the action runs. So you would gain very little benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the output cache filter, it does the correct thing and does not execute the action code if the result is in the output cache. Hope that helps. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can't predict at this moment how people will sort and filter your object collection, then you should look at &lt;strong&gt;System.Linq.Expressions&lt;/strong&gt; namespace to build your lambda expressions on demand during runtime (first you let user to build expression, then compile, run and at the end you use reflection namespace to enumerate through results). It's more tricky to wrap your head around it but invaluable feature, probably (to me definitively) even more ground-breaking feature than LINQ itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reflector, you will see that the DefaultEventAttribute allows itself to be inherited.
In reflector, you see that the UserControl class has it's default event set to the Load event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the possible reason is that even though you are decorating your user control with the default event of OKClick, VS might still be thinking that the default event is load, as it's being inherited from UserControl whose default event is Load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void foreachMove( void (*action)(chess_move*), chess_game* game);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which will call the function pointer action on each valid move. This is all well and good, but what if I need to pass more parameters to the action function? For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;chess_move getNextMove(chess_game* game, int depth){
  //for each valid move, determine how good the move is
  foreachMove(moveHandler, game);
}

void moveHandler(chess_move* move){
  //uh oh, now I need the variables "game" and "depth" from the above function
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Redefining the function pointer is not the optimal solution. The foreachMove function is versatile and many different places in the code reference it. It doesn't make sense for each one of those references to have to update their function to include parameters that they don't need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I pass extra parameters to a function that I'm calling through a pointer?&lt;/p&gt;

In the past, I've open-sourced quite a few PHP scripts and UNIX-based stuff. For those, I typically went with a BSD/Apache style license, unless I was including a library that prevented it. On the Linux/PHP side of things, that usually meant something that was GPL-ed, thus still resulting in a fairly clear-cut arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this project, however, I'm trying to figure out which licenses are even &lt;strong&gt;possible&lt;/strong&gt; to apply to this project and not finding any good resource to answer the question. I know that the only "real" answer to this question would involve a lawyer. However, as this isn't something that's going to generate revenue, if I'm going to kick in $1000 toward the project, I'd rather hire a graphic designer or a usability expert to take a pass at the application than pay a lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular project also uses Subsonic for database access and Argotic for RSS parsing, further complicating the issue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that I'm allowed to use all of those pieces and that I can redistribute my project that uses them all. However, what I'm left with is confusion over what the resulting project can/must be licensed under.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can probably negotiate my way through the maze for the Subsonic and Argotic bits because they're already under open source licenses, but I can't be the only one trying to figure out what license I can apply to a project I write on top of ASP.NET MVC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the comments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not "scared" of anything. I'm just attempting to put the same care into the licensing and distribution of this eventual application that I am into the architecture and development of it. Beyond that, I've watched lives ruined because of not paying attention to the arguably byzantine intellectual property laws on the books today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, quite frankly, I've actually gotten a nasty letter in the past from the lawyer of an open source component that I included in an &lt;strong&gt;open source&lt;/strong&gt; project of my own, but used a license that they weren't happy with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, "an open-source license" isn't any more specific in legal terms than saying, "just use a web programming language and you'll be fine". GPL is clearly one of the most popular open source licenses out there and also one of the few that, on the face of it, can't be applied to ASP.NET MVC applications. I'm curious if there &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; an existing license that can actually be "compiled" with the other licenses of the components I'm using without throwing a legal "compiler" error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying the answer is simple (it's not). I asked the question because I'm genuinely interested in an answer that comes from a perspective of having examined the issue closely. When I initially posted it, I fully expected it to sit unanswered for a long time because it's not a simple question.&lt;/p&gt;

Try doing something else that is very memory intensive and I'm sure that you'll notice that the memory allocated to Flash Player will decrease and be used for the other process instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I've understood it, memory management in modern OS's isn't intuitive from the perspective of looking at the amounts allocated to each process, or even the total amount allocated. When I've used my Mac for 5 minutes 95% of my 3 GB RAM is used, and it will stay that way, it never goes down. That's just the way the OS handles memory. As long as it's not needed elsewhere even processes that have quit still have memory assigned to them (this can make them launch quicker the next time, for example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antonio is right; if you need to pass extra parameters, you'll need to redefine your function pointer to accept the additional arguments. If you don't know exactly what parameters you'll need, then you have at least three choices:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have the last argument in your prototype be a void*. This gives you flexibility of passing in anything else that you need, but it definitely isn't type-safe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use variadic parameters (...). Given my lack of experience with variadic parameters in C, I'm not sure if you can use this with a function pointer, but this gives even more flexibility than the first solution, albeit still with the lack of type safety.&lt;/li&gt;

Let's see your implementations (in your language of choice, of course) of a function which returns a human readable String representation of a specified Integer. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;humanReadable(1) returns "one".
&lt;li&gt;humanReadable(53) returns "fifty-three".
&lt;li&gt;humanReadable(723603) returns "seven hundred and twenty-three thousand, six hundred and three".
&lt;li&gt;humanReadable(1456376562) returns "one billion, four hundred and fifty-six million, three hundred and seventy-six thousand, five hundred and sixty-two".
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonus points for particularly clever/elegant solutions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might seem like a pointless exercise, but there are number of real world applications for this kind of algorithm (although supporting numbers as high as a billion may be overkill :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a template definition, unqualified names will no longer find members of a dependent base (as specified by [temp.dep]/3 in the C++ standard). For example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;template &amp;lt;typename T&amp;gt; struct B {
  int m;
  int n;
  int f ();
  int g ();
};
int n;
int g ();
template &amp;lt;typename T&amp;gt; struct C : B&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; {
  void h ()
  {
    m = 0; // error
    f ();  // error
    n = 0; // ::n is modified
    g ();  // ::g is called
  }
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You must make the names dependent, e.g. by prefixing them with this-&gt;. Here is the corrected definition of C::h,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;template &amp;lt;typename T&amp;gt; void C&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;::h ()
{
  this-&amp;gt;m = 0;
  this-&amp;gt;f ();
  this-&amp;gt;n = 0
  this-&amp;gt;g ();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As an alternative solution (unfortunately not backwards compatible with GCC 3.3), you may use using declarations instead of this-&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;template &amp;lt;typename T&amp;gt; struct C : B&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; {
  using B&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;::m;
  using B&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;::f;
  using B&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;::n;
  using B&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;::g;
  void h ()
  {
    m = 0;
    f ();
    n = 0;
    g ();
  }
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's just all kinds of crazy.  Thanks, David.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the "temp.dep/3" section of the standard [ISO/IEC 14882:2003] that they are referring to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the definition of a class template or a member of a class template, if a base class of the class template depends on a template-parameter, the base class scope is not examined during unqualified name lookup either at the point of definition of the class template or member or during an instantiation of the class template or member. [Example: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;typedef double A; 
template&amp;lt;class T&amp;gt; class B { 
    typedef int A; 
}; 
template&amp;lt;class T&amp;gt; struct X : B&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; { 
    A a; // a has typedouble 
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The type name &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; in the definition of &lt;code&gt;X&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; binds to the typedef name defined in the global namespace scope, not to the typedef name defined in the base class &lt;code&gt;B&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. ] [Example: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;struct A { 
    struct B { /* ... */ }; 
    int a; 
    int Y; 
}; 
int a; 
template&amp;lt;class T&amp;gt; struct Y : T { 
    struct B { /* ... */ }; 
    B b; //The B defined in Y 
    void f(int i) { a = i; } // ::a 
    Y* p; // Y&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; 
}; 
Y&amp;lt;A&amp;gt; ya;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The members &lt;code&gt;A::B&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;A::a&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;A::Y&lt;/code&gt; of the template argument &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; do not affect the binding of names in &lt;code&gt;Y&amp;lt;A&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. ] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem when compiling B is that its base class A is unknown from the compiler, being a template class, so no way for the compiler to know any members from the base class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier versions did some inference by actually parsing the base template class, but ISO C++ stated that this inference can lead to conflicts where there should not be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution to reference a base class member in a template is to use this (like you did) or specifically name the base class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;template &amp;lt;typename T&amp;gt; class A {
public:
    T foo;
};

template &amp;lt;typename T&amp;gt; class B: public A &amp;lt;T&amp;gt; {
public:
    void bar() { cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; A&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;::foo &amp;lt;&amp;lt; endl; }

    // data1 is always chess_move
    chess_move data1 = DataArray[0]? (*(chess_move*)DataArray[0]) : NULL;

void foreachMove( void (*action)(void**), chess_game* game);

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;(withing having to manually implement sort or filter)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you reconsider implementing your own sort or filter functions?  In my experience it is easy to use.  The examples below use an anonymous delegate but you could easily define your own method or a class to implement a complex sort or filter.  Such a class could even have properties to configure and change the sort and filter dynamically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;.Sort(Comparison&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; comparison)&lt;/code&gt; with your custom compare function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Sort according to the value of SomeAttribute
List&amp;lt;MyCompositeObject&amp;gt; myList = ...;
myList.Sort(delegate(MyCompositeObject a, MyCompositeObject b) 
{
    // return -1 if a &amp;lt; b
    // return 0 if a == b
    // return 1 if a &amp;gt; b
    return a.SomeAttribute.CompareTo(b.SomeAttribute);
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar approach for getting a sub-collection of items from the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;.FindAll(Predicate&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; match)&lt;/code&gt; with your custom filter function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Select all objects where myObjectType1 and myObjectType2 are not null
myList.FindAll(delegate(MyCompositeObject a)
{
    // return true to include 'a' in the sub-collection
    return (a.myObjectType1 != null) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (a.myObjectType2 != null);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, please don't start passing around void pointers or (especially) arrays of void pointers.  That's just asking for trouble.  If you start passing void pointers, you're going to also have to pass some kind of message to indicate what the pointer type is (or types are).  This technique is &lt;em&gt;rarely&lt;/em&gt; appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your parameters are always the same, just add them to your function pointer arguments (or possibly pack them into a struct and use that as the argument if there are a lot of parameters).  If your parameters change, then consider using multiple function pointers for the multiple call scenarios instead of passing void pointers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I guess what I'm trying to say is that
  when I look at system requirements for
  certain software I rarely ever see the
  .NET Framework as being a requirement.
  So, I always wonder how they get by
  without it being a requirement (if
  they developed the software in .NET).
  So, I just assume that most commercial
  software is not written in .NET so
  that's why I'm asking this question.
  Hope that cleared some things up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many applications developed with C++/MFC for Windows desktops require a specific version of the MFC runtime DLLs even though it may not be explicitly listed as a requirement.  I believe the same is becoming true with applications requiring .NET.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the application I work on ships with redistributable files for both .NET and the particular version of MFC that we require as well as a number of other required components.  Our install program will install any components not currently installed on the users system.  Every release over the past several years has used more .NET code than the previous release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not think it is accurate to assume that most commercial software does not use .NET just because its not listed as a requirement.  I don't think you can accurately assume anything from that.&lt;/p&gt;

I figured out a solution.  The issue wasn't coming from what you suggested, but from how the delete works with Lists (at least how I have it in this instance).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up doing this little deal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;//gets the index of the node to replace from the same filter
var childIndex:int = (this._DataPages[this._Options.PageIndex].Data.(@Id == idOfReplacee)[0]).childIndex();
//deletes the node from the list
delete this._DataPages[this._Options.PageIndex].Data[childIndex];
//appends the new node from the webservice to the list
this._DataPages[this._Options.PageIndex].Data += this._WebService.GetSingleModelXml.lastResult.*[0].*[0];
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically I had to get the index of the node in the XMLList that is the Data property.  From there I could use the delete keyword to remove it from the list.  The += adds my new node to the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm so used to using the ActiveX or Mozilla XmlDocument stuff where you call "SelectSingleNode" and then use "replaceChild" to do this kind of stuff.  Oh well, at least this is in some forum where someone else can find it.  I do not know the procedure for what happens when I answer my own question.  Perhaps this insight will help someone else come along and help answer the question better!&lt;/p&gt;

The code builds a list (prior to this loop) which contains one item per row in the table. There is also a list containing one string for each column in the table. For each cell, the program creates an XML element and an XML tag by concatenating the items in the [row]/[column] positions of the two lists. It also associates the text in that cell to the newly-created element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharepoint lets you create tons of separate wikis, but I'd recommend having one big wiki for everything. My company made a bunch of little wikis for each project/feature, but only admins can create the individual wikis, so if I want to write about something that isn't doesn't match one of the predefined categories, I have to find a manager to create the wiki first.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, if you use Sharepoint make sure everyone on your staff only uses IE, since Firefox doesn't support the WYSIWIG editor. This is a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; thing for most wikis, but makes collaborating difficult in Sharepoint. Imagine editing auto-generated HTML in a tiny little box all day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, try to write up your project documentation in the wiki and resist the temptation to upload Word docs to the Sharepoint library. No point in writing up all your docs twice and watching things get more and more out of sync.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, image support in Sharepoint wikis is terrible.  You have to add a file to a document library somewhere and type in the URL. My images were forever getting deleted because they don't seem to make much sense out of context.&lt;/p&gt;

E.g.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;namespace std
{
    template&amp;lt;&amp;gt;
    void swap(my_type&amp;amp; lhs, my_type&amp;amp; rhs)
    {
       // ... blah
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then the usages in the std containers (and anywhere else) will pick your specialization  instead of the general one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also note that providing a base class implementation of swap isn't good enough for your derived types. E.g. if you have&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Base
{
    // ... stuff ...
}
class Derived : public Base
{
    // ... stuff ...
}

namespace std
{
    template&amp;lt;&amp;gt;
    void swap(Base&amp;amp; lha, Base&amp;amp; rhs)
    {
       // ...
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this will work for Base classes, but if you try to swap two Derived objects it will use the generic version from std because the templated swap is an exact match (and it avoids the problem of only swapping the 'base' parts of your derived objects).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A WSDL document defines services as collections of network endpoints, or ports. In WSDL, the abstract definition of endpoints and messages is separated from their concrete network deployment or data format bindings. This allows the reuse of abstract definitions: messages, which are abstract descriptions of the data being exchanged, and port types which are abstract collections of operations. The concrete protocol and data format specifications for a particular port type constitutes a reusable binding. A port is defined by associating a network address with a reusable binding, and a collection of ports define a service. Hence, a WSDL document uses the following elements in the definition of network services:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types&lt;/strong&gt; a container for data type definitions using some type system (such as XSD).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Message&lt;/strong&gt; an abstract, typed definition of the data being communicated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operation&lt;/strong&gt; an abstract description of an action supported by the service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Port Type&lt;/strong&gt;an abstract set of operations supported by one or more endpoints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Binding&lt;/strong&gt; a concrete protocol and data format specification for a particular port type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Port&lt;/strong&gt; a single endpoint defined as a combination of a binding and a network address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service&lt;/strong&gt; a collection of related endpoints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain, we, programmers and designers, all use design patterns... we just don't always realise it. I know this sounds clich, but you don't go to patterns, patterns come to you. You design stuff, it might look like an existing pattern, you name it that way so everyone understand what you are talking about and the rationale behind your design decision is stronger, knowing it has been discussed &lt;em&gt;ad nauseum&lt;/em&gt; before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally use patterns as a communication tool. That's it. They are not design solutions, they are not best practices, they are not tools in a toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong, if you are a beginner, books on patterns will show you how a solution is best solved "using" their patterns rather than another flawed design. You will probably learn from the exercise. However, you have to realise that this doesn't mean that every situation needs a corresponding pattern to solve it. Every situation has a quirk here and there that will require you to think about alternatives and take a difficult decision with no perfect answer. &lt;strong&gt;That's&lt;/strong&gt; design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anti-pattern however are on a totally different class. You actually &lt;strong&gt;want&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;actively&lt;/strong&gt; avoid anti-patterns. That's why the name anti-pattern is so controversial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get back to your original question:&lt;br /&gt;
"Do I use design patterns?", Yes!&lt;br /&gt;
"Do I actively lean toward design patterns?", No.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My answer: Choose base on the history of your developers. C# is more JAVA like, and probably C++ like.
VB.NET was easier for VB programmers, but I guess that is no really an issue anymore sine there are no new .NET programmers coming from old VB. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My opinion is that VB is more productive then C#, it seems it is always ahead in terms of productivity tools (such as intelisense), and I would recommend vb over c# to someone that asks. Of course, someone that knows he prefers c# won't ask, and c# is probably the right choice for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the apparent differences are syntactic sugar. For instance VB appears to support dynamic types, but really they're just as static as C#'s - the VB compiler figures them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visual Studio behaves differently with VB than with C# - it hides lots of functionality but adds background compiling (great for small projects, resource hogging for large ones) and better snippet support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a method of doing this, although it does transforming the strings, and is not Unicode friendly, it should be portable which is a plus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;bool caseInsensitiveStringCompare( const std::string&amp;amp; str1, const std::string&amp;amp; str2 ) {
    std::string str1Cpy( str1 );
    std::string str2Cpy( str2 );
    std::transform( str1Cpy.begin(), str1Cpy.end(), str1Cpy.begin(), ::tolower );
    std::transform( str2Cpy.begin(), str2Cpy.end(), str2Cpy.begin(), ::tolower );
    return ( str1Cpy == str2Cpy );
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I have read this is more portable than stricmp() because stricmp() is not in fact part of the std library, but only implemented by most compiler vendors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a truly Unicode friendly implementation it appears you must go outside the std library. One good 3rd party library is the &lt;a href="http://www.icu-project.org/"&gt;IBM ICU (International Components for Unicode)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also &lt;strong&gt;boost::iequals&lt;/strong&gt; provides a fairly good utility for doing this sort of comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm looking for discussion and what issues are important more than I'm looking for hard answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm in the middle of designing an app that does something like portfolio management.  The design I have so far is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problem: a problem that needs to be solved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solution: a proposed solution to one or more problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relationship: a relationship among two problems, two solutions, or a problem and a solution.  Further broken down into:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parent-child - some sort of categorization / tree hierarchy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overlap - the degree to which two solutions or two problems really address the same concept&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Addresses - the degree to which a problem addresses a solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is about the temporal nature of these things.  Problems crop up, then fade.  Solutions have an expected resolution date, but that might be modified as they are developed.  The degree of a relationship might change over time as problems and solutions evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the question: what is the best design for versioning of these things so I can get both a current and an historical perspective of my portfolio?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Later: perhaps I should make this a more specific question, though @Eric Beard's answer is worth an up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've considered three database designs.  I'll enough of each to show their drawbacks.  My question is: which to pick, or can you think of something better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1: Problems (and separately, Solutions) are self-referential in versioning.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;table problems
  int id | string name | text description | datetime created_at | int previous_version_id

  foreign key previous_version_id -&amp;gt; problems.id
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is problematic because every time I want a new version, I have to duplicate the entire row, including that long &lt;code&gt;description&lt;/code&gt; column.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2: Create a new Relationship type: Version.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;table problems
  int id | string name | text description | datetime created_at
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This simply moves the relationship from the Problems and Solutions tables into the Relationships table.  Same duplication problem, but perhaps a little "cleaner" since I already have an abstract Relationship concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3: Use a more Subversion-like structure; move all Problem and Solution attributes into a separate table and version them.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;table problems
  int id

table attributes
  int id | int thing_id | string thing_type | string name | string value | datetime created_at | int previous_version_id

  foreign key (thing_id, thing_type) -&amp;gt; problems.id or solutions.id
  foreign key previous_version_id -&amp;gt; attributes.id
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that to load the current version of a Problem or Solution I have to fetch all versions of the attribute, sort them by date and then use the most current.  That might not be terrible.  What seems really bad to me is that I can't type-check these attributes in the database.  That &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; column has to be free-text.  I can make the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; column a reference into a separate &lt;code&gt;attribute_names&lt;/code&gt; table that has a &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; column, but that doesn't &lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt; the correct type in the &lt;code&gt;attributes&lt;/code&gt; table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;later still: response to @Eric Beard's comments about multi-table foreign keys:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas, what I've described is simplistic: there are only two types of Things (Problems and Solutions).  I actually have about 9 or 10 different types of Things, so I'd have 9 or 10 columns of foreign keys under your strategy.  I wanted to use single-table inheritance, but the Things have so little in common that it would be &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; wasteful to do combine them into one table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    // create and initialize a crypto algorithm

    public static string encryptString(string clearText, string password) {
        SymmetricAlgorithm algorithm = getAlgorithm(password);
        byte[] clearBytes = System.Text.Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(clearText);
        MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream();
        CryptoStream cs = new CryptoStream(ms, algorithm.CreateEncryptor(), CryptoStreamMode.Write);
        cs.Write(clearBytes, 0, clearBytes.Length);
        cs.Close();
        return Convert.ToBase64String(ms.ToArray());
    }

    /*

    public static string decryptString(string cipherText, string password) {

        byte[] cipherBytes = Convert.FromBase64String(cipherText);
        MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream();
        CryptoStream cs = new CryptoStream(ms, algorithm.CreateDecryptor(), CryptoStreamMode.Write);
        cs.Write(cipherBytes, 0, cipherBytes.Length);

        return System.Text.Encoding.Unicode.GetString(ms.ToArray());
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code appears to work fine, except that when decrypting data with an incorrect key, I get a CryptographicException - "Padding is invalid and cannot be removed" - on the cs.Close() line in decryptString. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;example code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    string password1 = "password";
    string password2 = "letmein";
    string startClearText = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
    string cipherText = encryptString(startClearText, password1);
    string endClearText = decryptString(cipherText, password2);     // exception thrown
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is, is this to be expected? I would have thought that decrypting with the wrong password would just result in nonsense output, rather than an exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not really an issue if you're using ASP.NET stack (Webforms, MVC or rolling your own) because all your aspx files get compiled and therefore not touched by webserver. /bin/ folder is completely shadowed somewhere else, so libraries inside are not used by webserver either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IIS will wait until all requests are done (however there is some timeout though) and then will proceed with compilation (if needed) and restart of AppDomain. If only a few files have changed, there won't even be AppDomain restart. IIS will load new assemblies (or compiled aspx/asmx/ascx files) into existing AppDomain.&lt;/p&gt;

There are two options - the default includes the runtime but doesn't static link to it, the other staticly links you to the Mono runtime. The reason you might not want to static link is that it would put your application under the LGPL; bundles that aren't static linked (still just a single exe) don't have that requirement.

&lt;p&gt;There are times when you may want to do just this, but really only from a UI perspective.  If you implement some way to either stream the data to the client (via something like a pushlets mechanism), or chunk it into pages as you suggest, you can then load some really small subset on the client and then slowly build up the UI with the full amount of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes for a slicker, speedier UI (from the user's perspective), but you have to evaluate if the extra effort will be worthwhile... because I don't think it will be an insignificant amount of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Context.Cache.Insert("foo", _
                 Foo, _
                 Nothing, _

                 System.Web.Caching.Cache.NoSlidingExpiration)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then generate the results you need from that on every hit. Alternatively you can cache the webservice output on the function definition:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;WebMethod(CacheDuration:=60)&amp;gt; _

    Return "Hello World"

For example, several objects &lt;em&gt;have a&lt;/em&gt; damage counter, but to make this easy to use in an object list, polymorphism could be used - except that would imply an &lt;em&gt;is a&lt;/em&gt; relationship which wouldn't be true.

To be more specific, I am using C++, so using polymorphism would allow the different objects to "act the same" in the sense that the derived classes could reside within a single list and be operated upon by a virtual function of the base class.

You really have to decide what's best for your circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One option would be to have these objects implement a &lt;code&gt;Damageable&lt;/code&gt; interface, rather than inheriting from &lt;code&gt;DamageCounter&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Having the damage counter as an attribute doesn't allow him to diverse objects with damage counters into a collection.  For example, a person and a car might both have damage counters, but you can't have a &lt;code&gt;vector&amp;lt;Person|Car&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or a &lt;code&gt;vector&amp;lt;with::getDamage()&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or anything similar in most languages.  If you have a common Object base class, then you can shove them in that way, but then you can't access the &lt;code&gt;getDamage()&lt;/code&gt; method generically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was the essence of his question, as I read it.  "Should I violate &lt;code&gt;is-a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;has-a&lt;/code&gt; for the sake of treating certain objects as if they are the same, even though they aren't?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;alias_method_chain&lt;/code&gt; also has the benefit of creating named versions of the after_initialize method, meaning you can customize the call order in those rare cases that it matters.

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the language, you may well have the option of multiple inheritance, but normally simple interfaces make the most sense.  By "simple" I mean make an interface that isn't trying to be too much.  Better to have lots of simple interfaces and a few monolithic ones.

&lt;p&gt;They all have, e.g., one function in common.  Let's call it &lt;code&gt;addDamage()&lt;/code&gt;.  If you want to do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;foreach (obj in mylist)
    obj.addDamage(1)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you need either a dynamic language, or you need them to extend from a common parent class (or interface).  e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Person : DamageCounter {}
class Car : DamageCounter {}

foreach (DamageCounter d in mylist)
    d.addDamage(1)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, you can treat &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Car&lt;/code&gt; the same in certain very useful circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

If you're doing something that requires massive amounts of memory &amp;amp; resources (huge datasets and lots of math), XP is the way to go.  Even if you lose some of the memory by not running x64, you're still gaining about 750mb that would otherwise be chewed up by a lot of the Vista background services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're doing web development, it depends on your testing environment.  If you do everything locally using IIS &amp;amp; VS.NET, it doesn't really matter.  VS has it's own webserver built in.  If you have to test on IIS, it's handy to keep a virtual machine around to throw it onto a 2003 server.  Keep in mind that Vista will eat up some of that memory that could be used for a virtual machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given your list of requirements, I would have to recommend going with XP Pro.  If you're a heavy multitasker, you need all of your resources in front of you, not being chewed up by the Aero and background searching.  I used Vista for development for about 8 months, then I got a new job where I had XP.  At first it was annoying, but the responsiveness of XP trumped the features of Vista, especially when there are tons of windows open and all my RAM is gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a compatibility issue:  a lot of VS.NET (especially older versions) are fairly... difficult under Vista.  For instance, the publish feature for web sites can be broken under Vista.  You also have to be careful about how to deal with the UAC, as some VS.NET stuff requires you to &lt;em&gt;explicitly&lt;/em&gt; run as Administrator.  I also recall having some difficulty with Microsoft Virtual Machine, but this was in 2007.  I'm sure that's patched up by now.&lt;/p&gt;

They definetly are the "cargo cult" manifestation of programming with design patterns I have worked with many programmers that have never cracked the "GoF" book but they know 'Singelton' and thus they know 'Patterns'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have to disagree with Orion though, most of the time I've seen singeltons oversused it's not global variables in a dress, but more like global services(methods) in a dress.  It's interesting to note that if you try to use Singeltons in the SQL Server 2005 in safe mode through the CLR interface the system will flag the code.  The problem is that you have persistent data beyond any given transaction that may run, of course if you make the instance variable read only you can get around the issue.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a class called RssResult that
inherits off the abstract base class
ActionResult.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Override the ExecuteResult method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ExecuteResult has the ControllerContext passed to it by the caller and with this you can get the data and content type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you change the content type to rss, you will want to serialize the data to RSS (using your own code or another library) and write to the response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create an action on a controller that you want to return rss and set the return type as RssResult.  Grab the data from your model based on what you want to return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then any request to this action will receive rss of whatever data you choose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is probably the quickest and reusable way of returning rss has a response to a request in ASP.NET MVC.&lt;/p&gt;

But Web Services are supposed to be platform and operating system agnostic.  Serializing an object simply allows you to store and retrieve an object from a byte stream, such as a file.  For instance, you can serialize a Java object, convert that binary stream (perhaps via a Base 64 encoding into a CDATA field) and transfer that to service's client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the client would only be able to restore that object if it were Java-based.  Moreover, a deep copy is required to serialize an object and have it restored exactly.  Deep copies can be expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I once developed a small piece of software to a place I worked, and some forms had to use some info about the company, its employees, services and prices.  At its first version, the system kept loading that data from the database every time a form was opened.  Of course, I soon realized this approach was not the best one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I created a singleton class, named &lt;em&gt;company&lt;/em&gt;, which encapsulated everything about the place, and it was completely filled with data by the time the system was opened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not just a bunch of variables in a fancy dress because this was had dozens of responsibilities, like communicating with persistence layer to save/retrieve data about the company, deal with employees and prices collections, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, it was a fixed, system-wide, easily accessible point to have the company data.&lt;/p&gt;

In your specific case (C++), you can use pure virtual classes as interfaces.  This allows you to have multiple inheritance without creating scope/ambiguity problems.  Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Damage {
    virtual void addDamage(int d) = 0;
    virtual int getDamage() = 0;
};

class Person : public virtual Damage {
    void addDamage(int d) {
        // ...
        damage += d * 2;
    }

    int getDamage() {
        return damage;
    }
};

class Car : public virtual Damage {
    void addDamage(int d) {
        // ...
        damage += d;
    }

    int getDamage() {
        return damage;
    }
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now both Person and Car 'is-a' Damage, meaning, they implement the Damage interface.  The use of pure virtual classes (so that they are like interfaces) is key and should be used frequently.  It insulates future changes from altering the entire system.

  &lt;p&gt;I just answered my own question. I had
  the routes backwards (Default was
  above page).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, you have to put all custom routes above the Default route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So this brings up the next question...
  how does the "Default" route match (I
  assume they use regular expressions
  here) the "Page" route?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Default route matches based on what we call Convention over Configuration.  Scott Guthrie explains it well in his first blog post on ASP.NET MVC.  I recommend that you read through it and also his other posts.  Keep in mind that these were posted based on the first CTP and the framework has changed.  You can also find web cast on ASP.NET MVC on the asp.net site by Scott Hanselman.&lt;/p&gt;

It requires you to implement logging on your own everywhere you need it.  But, it also allows your to capture alot more then just the exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For exmaple our code would like like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
Try
  Dim p as New Person()
  p.Name = "Joe"
  p.Age = 30
Catch ex as Exception
  Log.LogException(ex,"Err creating person and assigning name/age")
  Throw ex
End Try
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way our logger will write all the info we need to a sql db.  We have email alerts set up at the db level to look for certain errors or frequently occurring errrors.  It helps us identify exactly where the errors are coming from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might not be exactly what you're looking for.  Another approach similar to using Global.asax is to us a code injection technique like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming" rel="nofollow"&gt;AOP&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="http://www.postsharp.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;PostSharp&lt;/a&gt;.  This allows you to inject custom code at the beginning and end of every method or on every exception.  It' an interesting approach but I believe it may have a heavy performance overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

That's why I say store it as UTC, as local time you need to adjust for anyone who's not in that timezone, and that's a lot of hard work.  And you need to store whether, for example, daylight savings was in effect when you stored the time.  Yuk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often in databases in the past I've stored two - UTC for sorting, local time for display.  That way neither the user nor the computer get confused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, as to display: Sure, you can do the "3 minutes ago" thing, but only if you store UTC - otherwise, data entered in different timezones is going to do things like display as "-4 hours ago", which will freak people out.  If you're going to display an actual time, people love to have it in their local time - and if data's being entered in multiple timezones you can only do that with ease if you're storing UTC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a table and added a row with the current localized timezone (Australia).
Then I changed my datetime to be GMT and added another row.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even tho those rows were added around 10 seconds apart, they appear in SQL server as tho they're 10 hours apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If nothing else, it at least tells me that I should be storing dates in a conisitent manner, which for me, adds weight to the argument for storing them as GMT.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Id="11994" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="10314" CreationDate="2008-08-15T05:32:40.293" Score="15" Body="&lt;p&gt;Most Cocoa projects use underbar as a non-&lt;code&gt;IBOutlet&lt;/code&gt; instance variable prefix, and use no prefix for &lt;code&gt;IBOutlet&lt;/code&gt; instance variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I don't use underbars for &lt;code&gt;IBOutlet&lt;/code&gt; instance variables is that when a nib file is loaded, if you have a setter method for a connected outlet, that setter will be called.  &lt;em&gt;However&lt;/em&gt; this mechanism does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; use Key-Value Coding, so an IBOutlet whose name is prefixed with an underbar (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;_myField&lt;/code&gt;) will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be set unless the setter is named exactly like the outlet (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;set_myField:&lt;/code&gt;), which is non-standard and gross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, be aware that using properties like &lt;code&gt;self.myProp&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the same as accessing instance variables.  You are &lt;strong&gt;sending a message&lt;/strong&gt; when you use a property, just like if you used bracket notation like &lt;code&gt;[self myProp]&lt;/code&gt;.  All properties do is give you a concise syntax for specifying both the getter and setter in a single line, and allow you to synthesize their implementation; they do not actually short-circuit the message dispatch mechanism.  If you want to access an instance variable directly but prefix it with &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; you need to treat &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; as a pointer, like &lt;code&gt;self-&amp;gt;myProp&lt;/code&gt; which really is a C-style field access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, never use Hungarian notation when writing Cocoa code, and shy away from other prefixes like "f" and "m_"  that will mark the code as having been written by someone who doesn't "get it" and will cause it to be viewed by suspicion by other Cocoa developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, follow the advice in the &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CodingGuidelines/index.html"&gt;Coding Guidelines for Cocoa&lt;/a&gt; document at the &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/"&gt;Apple Developer Connection&lt;/a&gt;, and other developers will be able to pick up and understand your code, and your code will work well with all of the Cocoa features that use runtime introspection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's what a window controller class might look like, using my conventions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// EmployeeWindowController.h
#import &amp;lt;AppKit/NSWindowController.h&amp;gt;

@interface EmployeeWindowController : NSWindowController {
@private
    // model object this window is presenting
    Employee *_employee;

    // outlets connected to views in the window
    IBOutlet NSTextField *nameField;
    IBOutlet NSTextField *titleField;
}

- (id)initWithEmployee:(Employee *)employee;

@property(readwrite, retain) Employee *employee;

@end

// EmployeeWindowController.m
#import "EmployeeWindowController.h"

@implementation EmployeeWindowController

@synthesize employee = _employee;

- (id)initWithEmployee:(Employee *)employee {
    if (self = [super initWithWindowNibName:@"Employee"]) {
        _employee = [employee retain];
    }
    return self;
}

- (void)dealloc {
    [_employee release];

    [super dealloc];
}

- (void)windowDidLoad {
    // populates the window's controls, not necessary if using bindings
    [nameField setStringValue:self.employee.name];
    [titleField setStringValue:self.employee.title];
}

@end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll see that I'm using the instance variable that references an &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; directly in my &lt;code&gt;-init&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-dealloc&lt;/code&gt; method, while I'm using the property in other methods.  That's generally a good pattern with properties:  Only ever touch the underlying instance variable for a property in initializers, in &lt;code&gt;-dealloc&lt;/code&gt;, and in the getter and setter for the property.&lt;/p&gt;

It's also extremely common in the Smalltalk world (in fact, I'd say it's nearly unheard-of in Smalltalk to use prefixes on instance variables).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prefixes on instance variables have always struck me as a C++-ism that was brought over to Java and then to C#.  Since the Objective-C world was largely parallel to the C++ world, where as the Java and C# worlds are successors to it, that would explain the "cultural" difference you might see on this between the different sets of developers.&lt;/p&gt;

That's done by setting the field's formatter to an instance of NSFormatter (whether one of the formatters included in Cocoa or a custom one), not by processing keystrokes directly.&lt;/p&gt;

I am trying to adopt a test driven development style, so my goal is to unit test all parts of the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my question is: Is there a good way to unit test a timer based class?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem, as I see it, is that there is a big risk that the tests will take uncomfortably long to execute, since they must wait so and so long for the desired actions to happen.&lt;br&gt;
Especially if one wants realistic data (seconds), instead of using the minimal time resolution allowed by the framework (1 ms?).&lt;br&gt;
I am using a mock object for the action, to register the number of times the action was called, and so that the action takes practically no time.&lt;/p&gt;

What you really need to decide is whether it is worthwhile for you to test the actual behaviour of the application (for example, if what happens after every tick changes drastically from one tick to another), or whether it is sufficient (that is to say, the action is the same every time) to just test your logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the timer's behaviour is guaranteed never to change, it's either going to work properly (ie, you've configured it right) or not; it seems to be to be wasted effort to include that in your test if you don't actually need to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intergration needs to be backed up with a big understanding by the business on the benefits - Get an opertating model sorted out - as the business may acutally need to standardise instead of intergrate, as this can be costly - its why most SOA fail! &lt;a href="http://mitsloan.mit.edu/cisr/papers.php"&gt;Enterprise Architecture: Driving Business Benefits from IT
Author(s): Jeanne W. Ross&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If intergration is needed you then need to settle on type of integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the speed and performance metrics?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a .NET SOA with a Composite Application that uses BizTalk 2006 and webservices with Line of Business Applications. Performance of the application at the composite end (consuming) - is limited to the speed of the webservices (and their implementation) in the line of business application!  We need sub &amp;lt;3 second return on results - list of cases. Could not be acheived in the webservices so we need to get go to the database directly for initial search.  Then over the webservices for case creation.  Cost implications and maintance becomes an issue here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point here is to look at the performance criteria in the specs and business requirements this will help in look at the type of integration that you need to do - WebServices (HTTP), File Drop/ EDI etc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functionally for intergration you need to then look at the points of failure in the proposed architecture - as this will lead to a chain of responisblity in SLA/OLA.  You may need to wrapper the intergration/faliure points into things that you control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On similar point about integration with Line of Business is with how much do you need to know about the other product before you can integrate?  Yeah Webservices are supposed to be design by contract but the implementation is often leaky and you need to understand alot about what is happening - and if this is a product that you dont control the abstraction even with webservices leaks into your intergation technology aka BizTalk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Couple these two points together and you the best advise is to get a intergration hub type like BizTalk - wrapper the line of business applications in webservices you create - so the BizTalk side can be free from leaky abstractions then you also can reduce the points of failure as the you have decoupled the line of business application from the intergration hub and the point of failure to a single source rather than inside an orchestration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instrumentation and diagnosics in SOA and Intergation Porjects are hard to acheive! - Dont let any shiney sales person try and tell you differently!  Yeah MOM with MOM Ent can do this UniCenter can do blah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main problem is understand what the error aka burps in the intergation mean and how to recover from them...  You end up with messages stuck and you need to understand what that means to that busienss process.  You can get an alert to say - processers are 100% Ram 100% orchestrations have failed - but no real meaning.   You have to engineer this stuff in to the solution from the outset - and hopefully into you points of failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Types of intergration patterns and how to do them do need to be considered too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above is a real world view of a .NET SOA with BizTalk in a LIVE implementation.  But it is also due to the architectural limitations of this - BizTalk mainly is a HUB and SPOKE pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0321127420"&gt;Enterprise Application Patterns by Martin Fowler&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to skin the task!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other considerations...  Platform/Developer Languages etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the big factors for us was the skills needed to start this stuff. We had OO devs with Java and C# understanding, but mainly C#.  So we went for the MS stack.  But when you choose the intergration type and the product to manage this they will need more skills in understanding that technology.  But hey this is normall for us Devs right?  Wrong many developers regardless of there expereince can come unstuck with the likes of BizTalk!  Big shift in paradigm - which in part is due to messaging shift rather than code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best bit for last!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numbers of transactions that are likely to be faced in the integration is probable the single biggest factor in all of this.  As this will guide what pattern, points of failure and tolarance for such things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to select best on anticpated volumes the right one.  Something that can scale up and scale out!  We selected BizTalk since it can scale up and scale out correctly and with better understanding than some others.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you dont have volumes then look at not getting something to manage them and go for a webservice to webservice type style with no management - performance and failure understanding will need to be coded into them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your on windows platform with .net 3 take look at WWF/WCF as this can help in webservice to webservice - lots more in the acutal platform now for all these concerns without the overhead of BizTalk and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No additional logic required! That's the point, your doing nothing to the classes in question, just wrapping them in some instantiation bubble-wrap! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, I was going to just bullet point but I wanted to see this work for myself, so I cobbled together some &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; rough code but the concept is there and it seems to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;APOLOGIES FOR THE LONG POST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The SafeLoader&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will basically be the "bubble" I mentioned.. It will get the controls HTML, catching any errors that occur during Rendering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class SafeLoader
{
    public static string LoadControl(Control ctl)
    {
        // In terms of what we could do here, its down
        // to you, I will just return some basic HTML saying
        // I screwed up.
        try
        {
            // Get the Controls HTML (which may throw)
            // And store it in our own writer away from the
            // actual Live page.
            StringWriter writer = new StringWriter();
            HtmlTextWriter htmlWriter = new HtmlTextWriter(writer);
            ctl.RenderControl(htmlWriter);

            return writer.GetStringBuilder().ToString();
        }
        catch (Exception)
        {
            string ctlType = ctl.GetType().Name;
            return "&amp;lt;span style=\"color: red; font-weight:bold; font-size: smaller;\"&amp;gt;" + 
                "Rob + Controls = FAIL (" + 
                ctlType + " rendering failed) Sad face :(&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;";
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;And Some Controls..&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok I just mocked together two controls here, one will throw the other will render junk. Point here, I don't give a crap. These will be replaced with your custom controls..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;BadControl&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class BadControl : WebControl
{
    protected override void Render(HtmlTextWriter writer)
    {
        throw new ApplicationException("Rob can't program controls");
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;GoodControl&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class GoodControl : WebControl
{
    protected override void Render(HtmlTextWriter writer)
    {
        writer.Write("&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Holy crap this control works&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;");
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Page&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, so lets look at the "test" page.. Here I simply instantiate the controls, grab their html and output it, I will follow with thoughts on designer support etc..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Page Code-Behind&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        // Create some controls (BadControl will throw)
        string goodHtml = SafeLoader.LoadControl(new BadControl());
        Response.Write(goodHtml);

        string badHtml = SafeLoader.LoadControl(new GoodControl());
        Response.Write(badHtml);
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, I know what you are thinking, "these controls are instantiated programatically, what about designer support? I spent freaking hours getting these controls nice for the designer, now you're messing with my mojo".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, so I havent really tested this yet (probably will do in a min!) but the idea here is to override the CreateChildControls method for the page, and take the instance of each control added on the form and run it through the SafeLoader. If the code passes, you can add it to the Controls collection as normal, if not, then you can create erroneous literals or something, up to you my friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Finally..&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, sorry for the long post, but I wanted to get the code here so we can discuss this :)
I hope this helps demonstrate my idea :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Update&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tested by chucking a control in on the designer and overriding the CreateChildControls method with this, works fine, may need some clean up to make things better looking, but I'll leave that to you ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;protected override void CreateChildControls()
{
    // Pass each control through the Loader to check
    // its not lame
    foreach (Control ctl in Controls)
    {
        string s = SafeLoader.LoadControl(ctl);
        // If its bad, smack it downnnn!
        if (s == string.Empty)
        {
            ctl.Visible = false; // Prevent Rendering
            string ctlType = ctl.GetType().Name;
            Response.Write("&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Problem Occurred Rendering " + 
                ctlType + " '" + ctl.ID + "'.&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;");
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With plain HTML you are pretty much limited to the experience you've described (no progress bar, double submits, etc). If you are willing to use some javascript, you can solve some of the problems by giving feedback that the upload is in progress and even &lt;a href="http://www.raditha.com/php/progress.php"&gt;showing the upload progress&lt;/a&gt; (it is a hack because you shouldn't have to do a full round-trip to the server and back, but at least it works).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are willing to use Flash (which is available pretty much anywhere and on many platforms), you can overcome pretty much all of these problems. A quick googling turned up &lt;a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2006/11/16/swfupload-open-source-flash-multi-file-upload/"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/aspnet/FlashUpload.aspx"&gt;such&lt;/a&gt; components, both of them free &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; open source. I never used any of them, but they look good. BTW, Flash isn't without its problems either, for example when using the multi-file uploader for slide share, the browser kept constantly crashing on me :-(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the best solution currently is to detect dynamically if the user has Flash, and if it's the case, give her the flash version of the uploader, while still making it possible to choose the basic HTML one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than force you to overload the method you can use a partial.  &lt;/p&gt;

I have been tasked with migrating the old data into the new schema. I have decided to do this by creating a small Windows Forms project as the schema are radically different and straight TSQL scripts are not an adequate solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main sealed class 'ImportController' that does the work declares the following delegate event:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public delegate void ImportProgressEventHandler(object sender, ImportProgressEventArgs e);
public static event ImportProgressEventHandler importProgressEvent;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main window starts a static method in that class using a new thread:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Thread dataProcessingThread = new Thread(new ParameterizedThreadStart(ImportController.ImportData));
dataProcessingThread.Name = "Data Importer: Data Processing Thread";
dataProcessingThread.Start(settings);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the ImportProgressEvent args carries a string message, a max int value for the progress bar and an current progress int value. The Windows form subcribes to the event:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ImportController.importProgressEvent += new ImportController.ImportProgressEventHandler(ImportController_importProgressEvent);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And responds to the event in this manner using it's own delegate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    private delegate void TaskCompletedUIDelegate(string completedTask, int currentProgress, int progressMax);

private void ImportController_importProgressEvent(object sender, ImportProgressEventArgs e)
            {
                this.Invoke(new TaskCompletedUIDelegate(this.DisplayCompletedTask), e.CompletedTask, e.CurrentProgress, e.ProgressMax);
            }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally the progress bar and listbox are updated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;private void DisplayCompletedTask(string completedTask, int currentProgress, int progressMax)
        {
            string[] items = completedTask.Split(new string[] { Environment.NewLine }, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);

            foreach (string item in items)
            {
                this.lstTasks.Items.Add(item);
            }

            if (currentProgress &amp;gt;= 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; progressMax &amp;gt; 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; currentProgress &amp;lt;= progressMax)
            {
                this.ImportProgressBar.Maximum = progressMax;
                this.ImportProgressBar.Value = currentProgress;
            }

&lt;p&gt;Using onblur for validation is problematic, because some folks use the enter key, not the mouse, to submit a form. Using onblur and the form's onsubmit event in conjunction could be a better solution. Back when I did JS validation for forms a lot more, I would run against keyup events. This gave the user instant feedback on whether or not their entry was correct. You can (and I did) also put checks in place so that the user doesn't receive an "incorrect" message until they've left the field (since you shouldn't tell them they're incorrect if they aren't done yet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a new Binding when you set the HeaderProperty property on the Header dependency property:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Header property is your normal everyday DependencyProperty:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    public string Header

        set { SetValue(HeaderProperty, value); }
    }

    public static readonly DependencyProperty HeaderProperty =
        DependencyProperty.Register("Header", typeof(string), typeof(ownerclass));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the property of your HeaderProperty works as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    public static readonly DependencyProperty HeaderPropertyProperty =
        DependencyProperty.Register("HeaderProperty", typeof(string), typeof(ownerclass), new PropertyMetadata(OnHeaderPropertyChanged));

    public string HeaderProperty        
    {
        get { return (string)GetValue(HeaderPropertyProperty); }
        set { SetValue(HeaderPropertyProperty, value); }
    }

   public static void OnHeaderPropertyChanged(DependencyObject obj, DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs args)
    {
        if (args.NewValue != null)
        {
            ownerclass c = (ownerclass) obj;

            Binding b = new Binding();
            b.Path = new PropertyPath(args.NewValue.ToString());
            c.SetBinding(ownerclass.HeaderProperty, b);
        }
    }

Most of those settings are there to customize certain business rules, but there's also some other stuff in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app contains objects that specifically do a certain task, e.g., a certain complicated calculation. Those non-UI objects are unit-tested, but also need access to lots of those global settings. The way we've implemented this right now, is by giving the objects properties that are filled by the Application Controller at runtime. When testing, we create the objects in the test and fill in values for testing (not from the database).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works better, in any case much better than having all those objects need some global &lt;em&gt;Settings&lt;/em&gt; object --- that of course effectively makes unit testing impossible :) Disadvantage can be that you sometimes need to set a dozen of properties, or that you need to let those properties 'percolate' into sub-objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So the general question is&lt;/strong&gt;: how do you provide access to global application settings in your projects, without the need for global variables, while still being able to unit test your code? This must be a problem that's been solved 100's of times...&lt;/p&gt;

As for the formatting of said file, you might want to take into account if a human is going to be manipulating it or not.

There's nothing wrong with XML, it's reasonably human readable (as much as YAML or JSON or INI files are) but remember its intent is to be read by machines. Most language/framework combos come with an XML parser of some sort for free which makes XML a pretty good choice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you're using a good IDE like Visual Studio, and if the XML comes with a schema, you can give the schema to VS and magically you get intellisense (you can get one for NHibernate for example).&lt;/p&gt;

It also seems to me that the combination of XML and XPath hits a sweet spot for data formats that need to be extensible; that is to say, its pretty easy to write XML-processing code that wont fail in the presence of changes to the message format that dont touch the piece you care about."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your production code then initializes the service locator like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ServiceLocator::load(new ServiceLocator());
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your test-code, you insert your mock-settings like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ServiceLocator s = new ServiceLocator();
s-&amp;gt;setGlobalSettings(new MockGlobalSettings());
ServiceLocator::load(s);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Dillie-O's code is a good way in older SQL versions (+1 vote), but it still is basically two IO operations (the &lt;code&gt;exists&lt;/code&gt; and then the &lt;code&gt;update&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;insert&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a slightly better way on &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13540/insert-update-stored-proc-on-sql-server"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, basically:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;--try an update
update tablename 
set field1 = 'new value',
    field2 = 'different value',
    ...
where idfield = 7

--insert if failed
if @@rowcount = 0 and @@error = 0
    insert into tablename 
           ( idfield, field1, field2, ... )
    values ( 7, 'value one', 'another value', ... )
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reduces it to one IO operations if it's an update, or two if an insert. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS Sql2008 introduces &lt;code&gt;merge&lt;/code&gt; from the SQL:2003 standard:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;merge tablename as target
using (values ('new value', 'different value'))
    as source (field1, field2)
    on target.idfield = 7
when matched then
    update
    set field1 = source.field1,
        field2 = source.field2,
        ...
when not matched then
    insert ( idfield, field1, field2, ... )
    values ( 7,  source.field1, source.field2, ... )
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it's really just one IO operation, but awful code :-(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real question Rory asks is presented much later and is more pertinent to the example he gives.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Why is the s_Initialized field read
  outside of the lock?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to this is also simple, though completely unrelated to the atomicity of variable access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The s_Initialized field is read outside of the lock because &lt;strong&gt;locks are expensive&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the s_Initialized field is essentially "write once" it will never return a false positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's economical to read it outside the lock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;em&gt;low cost&lt;/em&gt; activity with a &lt;em&gt;high&lt;/em&gt; chance of having a benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why it's read outside of the lock -- to avoid paying the cost of using a lock unless it's indicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If locks were cheap the code would be simpler, and omit that first check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn't offer any kind of protection against disassembly.  First I imagine its quite possible to extract raw files from any installation package like an MSI or a CAB file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But more importantly, Ngen runs on the client machine after the assembly has been installed.  Ngen just forces the assembly to compile now instead of later using the JIT. The original assembly remains and is unmodified and it must remain because Ngen might not be able to compile the entire assembly.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ngen is for performance, not security, and does nothing to prevent disassembly or make it even slightly more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

This gives me a single point to get any configuration value that I need and by putting it outside the application in a separate library, it allows reuse and testability.  Here is some sample code, I am not sure what language you are using, but I wrote it in C#.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I create a generic class that will models my ConfigurationItem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class ConfigurationItem&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;
{
    private T item;

    public ConfigurationItem(T item)
    {
        this.item = item;
    }

    public T GetValue()
    {
        return item;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I create a class that exposes public static readonly variables for the configuration item.  Here I am just reading the ConnectionStringSettings from a config file, which is just xml.  Of course for more items, you can read the values from any source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class ConfigurationItems
{
    public static ConfigurationItem&amp;lt;ConnectionStringSettings&amp;gt; ConnectionSettings = new ConfigurationItem&amp;lt;ConnectionStringSettings&amp;gt;(RetrieveConnectionString());

    private static ConnectionStringSettings RetrieveConnectionString()
    {
        // In .Net, we store our connection string in the application/web config file.
        // We can access those values through the ConfigurationManager class.
        return ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ConnectionKey"]];
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then when I need a ConfigurationItem for use, I call it like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ConfigurationItems.ConnectionSettings.GetValue();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it will return me a type safe value, which I can then cache or do whatever I want with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a sample test:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[TestFixture]
public class ConfigurationItemsTest
{
    [Test]
    public void ShouldBeAbleToAccessConnectionStringSettings()
    {
        ConnectionStringSettings item = ConfigurationItems.ConnectionSettings.GetValue();
        Assert.IsNotNull(item);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the original question was asking about application configuration that an admin would be doing, not just storing user preferences.  The suggestions you gave seem more for user prefs than application config, and aren't usually something that the user would ever deal with directly (the app should provide the configuration options in the UI, and then update the files).  I really hope you'd never make the user have to view/edit the Registry. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the actual question, I'd say XML is probably OK, as plenty of people will be used to using that for configuration.  As long as you organize the configuration values in an easy to use manner then the "angle bracket tax" shouldn't be too bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be careful with these kinds of "multidirectional" foreign keys.  My experience has shown that query performance suffers dramatically when your join condition has to check the type before figuring out which table to join on.  It doesn't seem as elegant but nullable &lt;/p&gt;

Construct scenarios that exercise internal conditions of the passive object.  Include one longer running test that basically beats the heck out of it from multiple threads for a long period of time.  This is unscientific I know but it does build confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unit tests for &lt;a href="http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~schmidt/PDF/Act-Obj.pdf"&gt;Active objects&lt;/a&gt; (those that encapsulate their own thread or threads of control) -- similar to #2 above with variations depending on the class design.

I'm working on a project that is inherently multithreaded.  Events come in from the operating system and I have to process them concurrently.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplest way to deal with testing complex, multithhreaded application code is this:  If its too complex to test, you're doing it wrong.  If you have a single instance that has multiple threads acting upon it, and you can't test situations where these threads step all over each other, then your design needs to be redone.  Its both as simple and as complex as this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to program for multithreading that avoids threads running through instances at the same time.  The simplest is to make all your objects immutable.  Of course, that's not usually possible.  So you have to identify those places in your design where threads interract with the same instance and reduce the number of those places.  By doing this, you isolate a few classes where multithreading actually occurs, reducing the overall complexity of testing your system.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you have to realize that even by doing this you still can't test every situation where two threads step on each other.  To do that, you'd have to run two threads concurrently in the same test, then control exactly what lines they are executing at any given moment.  The best you can do is simulate this situation.  But this might require you to code specifically for testing, and that's at best a half step towards a true solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the best way to test code for threading issues is through static analysis of the code.  If your threaded code doesn't follow a finite set of thread safe patterns, then you might have a problem.  I believe Code Analysis in VS does contain some knowledge of threading, but probably not much. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, as things stand currently (and probably will stand for a good time to come), the best way to test multithreaded apps is to reduce the complexity of threaded code as much as possible.  Minimize areas where threads interact, test as best as possible, and use code analysis to identify danger areas.&lt;/p&gt;

I see your point - the way I've asked, and then commented on, the question allows it to be taken in a couple of different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I wanted to know if it was safe to have concurrent threads read and write to a boolean field without any explicit synchronization code, i.e., is accessing a boolean (or other primitive-typed) variable atomic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then used the Membership code to give a concrete example, but that introduced a bunch of distractions, like the double-check locking, the fact that s_Initialized is only ever set once, and that I commented out the initialization code itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My bad.&lt;/p&gt;

However, the simplest one is always the best.  Which way is the simplest for you?  Depends on your requirements.  But there are some general rules of thumb I follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, reduce the overall number of projects as much as possible.  When you compile twenty times a day, that extra minute adds up.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your app is designed for extensibility, consider splitting your assemblies along the lines of design vs. implementation.  Place your interfaces and base classes in a public assembly.  Create an assembly for your company's implementations of these classes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For large applications, keep your UI logic and business logic separate.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SIMPLIFY your solution.  If it looks too complex, it probably is.  Combine, reduce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its real hard at first, since there is so much. I think the best advice I could give is to just &lt;strong&gt;invest time in it&lt;/strong&gt; on the wind down on a Friday afternoon, for a couple of weeks I would just pick an app/chunk of code, examine what was there, think about what we could make generic, copy it, put it into the new library wherever I thought it should be. Once I had all the code within an application migrated, I would then work on refactoring the application to work from the common framework.. This sometimes caused problems that needed to be fixed, but so long as your thorough it shouldn't be too big a deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Piece by piece, thats the only way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of structure, I tried to kind of mimic the MS namespacing since for the most part its pretty logical (e.g. &lt;em&gt;Company.Data&lt;/em&gt; , &lt;em&gt;Company.Web&lt;/em&gt; , &lt;em&gt;Company.Web.UI&lt;/em&gt; and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the major benefits is probably the amount of code dupe removed. Yeah a little refactoring was required in the apps, but the code base is a lot leaner, and in many ways "smarter".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing I noticed is that I would often have problems trying to figure out &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; to put stuff (in terms of namespacing) since I wasn't sure what it belonged to. Now this &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; concerned me, I viewed it as such a bad smell. Since the re-org everything now falls in to space much more nicely. And with the (now very small amount) of application specfic code, they get put into &lt;em&gt;Company.Applications.ApplicationName&lt;/em&gt; This helps me really think about business objects a lot more since I dont want too much within this namespace, so I come up with more flexible designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long post.. It's kind of rambling!&lt;/p&gt;

They all have their strengths and weaknesses.&lt;br /&gt;
In an application context, I feel that the abstraction layer is the important thing.&lt;br /&gt;
If you can choose a way to structure the data that is a good middle ground between human readability and how you want to access/abstract the data in code, you're golden.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We mostly use XML where I work, and I cant really believe that a configuration file loaded into a cache as objects when first read or after it has been written to, and then abstracted away from the rest of the program, really is that much of a hit on neither CPU nor disk space.&lt;br /&gt;
And it is pretty readable too, as long as you structure the file right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all languages on all platforms supports XML through some pretty common libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

Due to msbuild using the csproj has it's build file, all the source in that project is compiled into one assembly.  Which causes me to have a lot of projects in my solution for large projects where I am separating logic.  Well with nant, I can arrange my build where I can compile what I want into multiple assemblies from one project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like this route, because it keeps me from having to many project files in my solution.  I can have one project with folders splitting out the layers and then use nant to build each layer into it's own assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I do use both nant and msbuild in conjunction for some build tasks, like building WPF applications.  It is just a lot easier to compile a WPF application with the msbuild target within nant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To end this and the point of my answer is that I like to use them side by side, but when I use msbuild in this configuration, it is usually for straight compiling, not performing any build automation tasks like copying files to a directory, generating the help documentation, or running my unit tests for example.&lt;/p&gt;

Chris, is right. I am looking for a generic solution for normalizing any kind of text. The solution of the problem boils down to dynmamically finding patterns in two or more similar strings. 
Almost like predicting the next element in a set, based on the previous two:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1: Everest is 30000 feet high&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2: K2 is 28000 feet high&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;=&gt; What is the pattern?
=&gt; Answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[name] is [number] feet high&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the text file can have millions of lines and thousands of patterns. I would like to parse the files very, very fast, find the patterns and collect the data sets that are associated with each pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought about creating some high level semantic hashes to represent the patterns in the message strings.
I would use a tokenizer and give each of the tokens types a specific "weight". 
Then I would group the hashes and rate their similarity. Once the grouping is done I would collect the data sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was hoping, that I didn't have to reinvent the wheel and could reuse something that is already out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the error message said &lt;strong&gt;The specified module could not be found&lt;/strong&gt;, this is a little misleading -- it's not that it couldn't find php_curl.dll, but rather it couldn't find a module that php_curl.dll required.  The 2 DLLs it requires are libeay32.dll SSLeay32.dll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you have to put those 2 DLLs somewhere in your PATH (e.g., C:\Windows\system32).  That's all there is to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOWEVER, even that did not work for me initially.  So I downloaded the Windows zip of the latest version of PHP, which includes all the necessary DLLs.  I didn't reinstall PHP, I just copied all of the DLLs in the "ext" folder to my PHP extensions folder (as specified in the
extension_dir variable in php.ini), and I copied the versions of libeay32.dll and SSLeay32.dll from the PHP download into my System32 directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also did an iisreset, but I don't know if that was necessary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite right now is to simply include &lt;a href="http://www.lua.org"&gt;Lua&lt;/a&gt;, because&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can permit things like width=height*(1+1/3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can make custom functions available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can forbid anything else. (impossible in, for instance, Python (including pickles.))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'll probably want a scripting language somewhere else in the project anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option, if there's a lot of data is to use &lt;a href="http://www.sqlite.org/"&gt;sqlite3&lt;/a&gt;, because they're right to claim&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reliable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose any three.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To which I would like to add:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;backups are a snap. (just copy the db file.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easier to switch to another db, ODBC, whatever. (than it is from fugly-file)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But again, this is a bigger issue. A "big" answer to this probably involves some kind of feature matrix or list of situations like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Amount of data, or short runtime&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For large amounts of data, you might want efficient storage, like a db.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For short runs (often), you might want something that you don't need to do a lot of parsing for, consider something that can be mmap:ed in directly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What does the configuration relate to?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Host:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like YAML in /etc. Is that reimplemented in windows?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you permit users to edit config with text editor?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should it be centrally manageable? Registry / gconf / remote db?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May the user have several different &lt;em&gt;profiles&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File(s) in project directory? (Version control usually follows this model...)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Complexity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there only a few flat values? Consider YAML.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the data nested, or dependent in some way? (This is where it gets interesting.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Might it be a desirable feature to permit some form of scripting?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Templates can be viewed as a kind of configuration files..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

But we still have thousands of lines of business logic in stored procedures, which only really get tested in anger when our product is rolled out to a large number of users. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes this worse is that some of these stored procedures end up being very long, because of the performance hit when passing temporary tables between SPs. This has prevented us from refactoring to make the code simpler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have made several attempts at building unit tests around some of our key stored procedures (primarily testing the performance), but have found that setting up the test data for these tests is really hard. For example, we end up copying around test databases. In addition to this, the tests end up being really sensitive to change, and even the smallest change to a stored proc. or table requires a large amount of changes to the tests. So after many builds breaking due to these database tests failing intermittently, weve just had to pull them out of the build process.&lt;/p&gt;

IDisposable is a pattern for freeing &lt;em&gt;unmanaged&lt;/em&gt; resources -- and memory is quite definitely a managed resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The links pointing to GC.Collect() are the correct answer, though use of this function is generally discouraged by the Microsoft .NET documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; Having earned a substantial amount of karma for this answer, I feel a certain responsibility to elaborate on it, lest a newcomer to .NET resource management get the wrong impression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside a .NET process, there are two kinds of resource -- managed and unmanaged.  "Managed" means that the runtime is in control of the resource, while "unmanaged" means that it's the programmer's responsibility.  And there really is only one kind of managed resource that we care about in .NET today -- memory.  The programmer tells the runtime to allocate memory and after that it's up to the runtime to figure out when the memory can freed.  The mechanism that .NET uses for this purpose is called garbage collection and you can find plenty of information about GC on the internet simply by using Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the other kinds of resources, .NET doesn't know anything about cleaning them up so it has to rely on the programmer to do the right thing.  To this end, the platform gives the programmer three tools:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The IDisposable interface and the "using" statement in VB and C#&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finalizers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The IDisposable pattern as implemented by many BCL classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of these allows the programmer to efficiently acquire a resource, use it and then release it all within the same method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;using (DisposableObject tmp = DisposableObject.AcquireResource()) {
    // Do something with tmp
}
// At this point, tmp.Dispose() will automatically have been called
// BUT, tmp may still a perfectly valid object that still takes up memory
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If "AcquireResource" is a factory method that (for instance) opens a file and "Dispose" automatically closes the file, then this code cannot leak a file resource.  But the memory for the "tmp" object itself may well still be allocated.  That's because the IDisposable interface has absolutely no connection to the garbage collector.  If you &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; want to ensure that the memory was freed, your only option would be to call &lt;code&gt;GC.Collect()&lt;/code&gt; to force a garbage collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it cannot be stressed enough that this is probably not a good idea.  It's generally much better to let the garbage collector do what it was designed to do, which is to manage memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens if the resource is being used for a longer period of time, such that its lifespan crosses several methods?  Clearly, the "using" statement is no longer applicable, so the programmer would have to manually call "Dispose" when he or she is done with the resource.  And what happens if the programmer forgets?  If there's no fallback, then the process or computer may eventually run out of whichever resource isn't being properly freed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's where finalizers come in.  A finalizer is a method on your class that has a special relationship with the garbage collector.  The GC promises that -- before freeing the memory for any object of that type -- it will first give the finalizer a chance to do some kind of cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the case of a file, we theoretically don't need to close the file manually at all.  We can just wait until the garbage collector gets to it and then let the finalizer do the work.  Unfortunately, this doesn't work well in practice because the garbage collector runs non-deterministically.  The file may stay open considerably longer than the programmer expects.  And if enough files are kept open, the system may fail when trying to open an additional file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most resources, we want both of these things.  We want a convention to be able to say "we're done with this resource now" and we want to make sure that there's at least some chance for the cleanup to happen automatically if we forget to do it manually.  That's where the "IDisposable" pattern comes into play.  This is a convention that allows IDispose and a finalizer to play nicely together.  You can see how the pattern works by looking at the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.idisposable.aspx"&gt;official documentation for IDisposable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom line:&lt;/strong&gt; If what you really want to do is to just make sure that memory is freed, then IDisposable and finalizers will not help you.  But the IDisposable interface is part of an extremely important pattern that all .NET programmers should understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Websphere MQ seems to be an easier sell to larger corporates and it probably seen greater use at the enterprise level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indexus&lt;/strong&gt; - Very immature, stubbed session interface implementation.  Its otherwise a great caching solution, though.&lt;/li&gt;

Several SF.Net projects - All aborted in the early stages... nothing that appears to have any traction, and one which seems to have gone all commercial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Velocity&lt;/strong&gt; - Not OSS, but seems nice.  Unfortunately, I didn't see where CTP1 supported failover, and there is no clear roadmap for this one.  I fear that this one could fall off into the ether like many other MS dev projects.&lt;/li&gt;

I had only changed stored procedures but when I generated the SQL I had "script dependent objects" checked. I ran it on my local machine and all appeared to work well. I ran it on the client's server and the script succeeded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I loaded the web site and the site was empty. To my horror, the "script dependent objects" setting did a &lt;code&gt;DROP TABLE&lt;/code&gt; for every table that my stored procedures touched. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I immediately called the lead dev and boss letting them know what happened and asking where the latest backup of the DB could be located. 2 other devs were conferenced in and the conclusion we came to was that no backup system was even in place and no data could be restored. The client lost their entire website's content and I was the root cause. The result was a &lt;strong&gt;$5000&lt;/strong&gt; credit given to our client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me it was a great lesson, and now I am super-cautious about running any change scripts, and backing up DBs first. I'm still with the same company today, and whenever the jokes come up about backups or database scripts someone always brings up the famous "DROP TABLE" incident.&lt;/p&gt;

To a first approximation, the OS loads the relevant sections of the .EXE file into ram, and then jumps to the entry point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As others have said, this entry point will not be 'main', but will instead be a part of the runtime library - it will do things like initialising static objects, setting up the argc/argv parameters, setting up stdin/stdout/stderr, etc.   When it's done all that, it will call your main() function.  When main exits, the runtime goes through an analagous process of passing your return code back to the environment, calling static destructors, calling _atexit routines, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have MS tools (perhaps not the freebie ones), then you have all the runtime source, and an easy way to look at it is to put a breakpoint on the closing brace of your main() method, and single step back up into the runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my cynical world, stored procedures are part of the RDBMS world's long-standing attempt to persuade you to move your business processing into the database, which makes sense when you consider that server license costs tend to be related to things like processor count. The more stuff you run inside your database, the more they make from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I get the impression you're actually more concerned with performance, which isn't really the preserve of unit testing at all. Unit tests are supposed to be fairly atomic and are intended to check behaviour rather than performance. And in that case you're almost certainly going to need production-class loads in order to check query plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you need a different class of testing environment. I'd suggest a copy of production as the simplest, assuming security isn't an issue. Then for each candidate release, you start with the previous version, migrate using your release procedures (which will give those a good testing as a side-effect) and run your timings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to understand whether your application leaks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interesting way is to open &lt;em&gt;perfmon&lt;/em&gt; and add traces for &lt;em&gt;# bytes in all heaps&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;# Gen 2 collections&lt;/em&gt; , in each case looking just at your process.  If exercising a particular feature causes the total bytes to increase, and that memory remains allocated after the next Gen 2 collection, you might say that the feature leaks memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to prevent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other good opinions have been given.  I would just add that perhaps the &lt;em&gt;most commonly overlooked&lt;/em&gt; cause of .NET memory leaks is to add event handlers to objects without removing them.  An event handler attached to an object is a form of reference to that object, so will prevent collection even after all other references have gone.  Always remember to detach event handlers (using the &lt;code&gt;-=&lt;/code&gt; syntax in C#).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the leak go away when the process exits, and what about COM interop?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your process exits, all memory mapped into its address space is reclaimed by the OS, including any COM objects served from DLLs.  Comparatively rarely, COM objects can be served from separate processes.  In this case, when your process exits, you may still be responsible for memory allocated in any COM server processes that you used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's my logic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, EF is supposed to be more than 1:1 table mapping, so it's quite possible that just because you are deleting a column from table A doesn't mean that for that entity, there shouldn't be a property Description. You might just map that property to another table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;nave!!&lt;/strong&gt; algorithm keeps track of the frequency of words in a per-column manner, where one can assume that each line can be separated into columns with a delimiter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example input:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The dog jumped over the moon&lt;br /&gt;
  The cat jumped over the moon&lt;br /&gt;
  The moon jumped over the moon&lt;br /&gt;
  The car jumped over the moon  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequencies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Column 1: {The: 4}
Column 2: {car: 1, cat: 1, dog: 1, moon: 1}
Column 3: {jumped: 4}
Column 4: {over: 4}
Column 5: {the: 4}
Column 6: {moon: 4}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could partition these frequency lists further by grouping based on the total number of fields, but in this simple and convenient example, we are only working with a fixed number of fields (6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to iterate through lines which generated these frequency lists, so let's take the first example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The&lt;/strong&gt;: meets some hand-wavy criteria and the algorithm decides it must be static.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dog&lt;/strong&gt;: doesn't appear to be static based on the rest of the frequency list, and thus it must be dynamic as opposed to static text.  We loop through a few pre-defined regular expressions and come up with &lt;code&gt;/[a-z]+/i&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;over&lt;/strong&gt;: same deal as #1; it's static, so leave as is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt;: same deal as #1; it's static, so leave as is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;moon&lt;/strong&gt;: same deal as #1; it's static, so leave as is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, just from going over the first line we can put together the following regular expression:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/The ([a-z]+?) jumps over the moon/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considerations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously one can choose to scan part or the whole document for the first pass, as long as one is confident the frequency lists will be a sufficient sampling of the entire data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;False positives may creep into the results, and it will be up to the filtering algorithm (hand-waving) to provide the best threshold between static and dynamic fields, or some human post-processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall idea is probably a good one, but the actual implementation will definitely weigh in on the speed and efficiency of this algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But I get the impression you're actually more concerned with performance, which isn't really the preserve of unit testing at all. Unit tests are supposed to be fairly atomic and are intended to check behaviour rather than performance. And in that case you're almost certainly going to need production-class loads in order to check query plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there are two quite distinct testing areas here: the performance, and the actual logic of the stored procedures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave the example of testing the db performance in the past and, thankfully, we have reached a point where the performance is good enough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I completely agree that the situation with all the business logic in the database is a bad one, but it's something that we've inherited from before most of our developers joined the company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we're now adopting the web services model for our new features, and we've been trying to avoid stored procedures as much as possible, keeping the logic in the C# code and firing SQLCommands at the database (although linq would now be the preferred method). There is still some use of the existing SPs which was why I was thinking about retrospectively unit testing them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development Documents&lt;/strong&gt; - Written by the developers as they work, with a double check done once the code is checked in to ensure that the documents are accurate. In an ideal world, the documents would be checked out/in at the same time the code is checked out/in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System Administration Documents&lt;/strong&gt; - Written by the developers with the assistance of potential system administrators to ensure that confusing issues are identified and documented from the beginning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Documents&lt;/strong&gt; - Ideally, written by individuals acting as normal users who have been trained in the software by the developers. Additionally, users should be shown the manuals prior to release and asked to preform tasks based upon the documentation to ensure that it is clear enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to put my vote in for heavily favoring stored procedures and placing your business logic where I (and most DBAs) think it belongs, in the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that we as software engineers want beautifully refactored code, written in our favorite language, to contain all of our important logic, but the realities of performance in high volume systems, and the critical nature of data integrity, require us to make some compromises.  Sql code can be ugly, repetitive, and hard to test, but I can't imagine the difficulty of tuning a database without having complete control over the design of the queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am often forced to completely redesign queries, to include changes to the data model, to get things to run in an acceptable amount of time.  With stored procedures, I can assure that the changes will be transparent to the caller, since a stored procedure provides such excellent encapsulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;MSBuild can generate the necessary deployment files for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MSBuild won't deploy the files to the FTP or UNC share. You'll need a separate step for this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use MSBuild to generate the ClickOnce manifests, here's the command you'll need to issue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;msbuild /target:publish /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=AnyCPU; "c:\yourProject.csproj"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That will tell MSBuild to build your project and generate ClickOnce deployment files inside the &lt;em&gt;bin\Release\YourProject.publish&lt;/em&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that's left is to copy those files to the FTP/UNC share/wherever, and you're all set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can tell CruiseControl.NET to build using those MSBuild parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll then need a CruiseControl.NET build task to take the generated deployment files and copy them to the FTP or UNC share. We use a custom little C# console program for this, but you could just as easily use a Powershell script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As an example of polymorphism in
  action, let's look at the classic
  "eval" interview question, which (as
  far as I know) was brought to Amazon
  by Ron Braunstein. The question is
  quite a rich one, as it manages to
  probe a wide variety of important
  skills: OOP design, recursion, binary
  trees, polymorphism and runtime
  typing, general coding skills, and (if
  you want to make it extra hard)
  parsing theory.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;At some point, the candidate hopefully
  realizes that you can represent an
  arithmetic expression as a binary
  tree, assuming you're only using
  binary operators such as "+", "-",
  "*", "/". The leaf nodes are all
  numbers, and the internal nodes are
  all operators. Evaluating the
  expression means walking the tree. If
  the candidate doesn't realize this,
  you can gently lead them to it, or if
  necessary, just tell them.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Even if you tell them, it's still an
  interesting problem.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The first half of the question, which
  some people (whose names I will
  protect to my dying breath, but their
  initials are Willie Lewis) feel is a
  Job Requirement If You Want To Call
  Yourself A Developer And Work At
  Amazon, is actually kinda hard. The
  question is: how do you go from an
  arithmetic expression (e.g. in a
  string) such as "2 + (2)" to an
  expression tree. We may have an ADJ
  challenge on this question at some
  point.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The second half is: let's say this is
  a 2-person project, and your partner,
  who we'll call "Willie", is
  responsible for transforming the
  string expression into a tree. You get
  the easy part: you need to decide what
  classes Willie is to construct the
  tree with. You can do it in any
  language, but make sure you pick one,
  or Willie will hand you assembly
  language. If he's feeling ornery, it
  will be for a processor that is no
  longer manufactured in production.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;You'd be amazed at how many candidates
  boff this one.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I won't give away the answer, but a
  Standard Bad Solution involves the use
  of a switch or case statment (or just
  good old-fashioned cascaded-ifs). A
  Slightly Better Solution involves
  using a table of function pointers,
  and the Probably Best Solution
  involves using polymorphism. I
  encourage you to work through it
  sometime. Fun stuff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let's try to tackle the problem all three ways.  How do you go from an arithmetic expression (e.g. in a string) such as "2 + (2)" to an expression tree using cascaded-if's, a table of function pointers, and/or polymorphism?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to tackle one, two, or all three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a general rule, if you can do something in IIS AND in SharePoint, you should do it only in SharePoint.&lt;/p&gt;

If you have enough rep to downvote posts, you have enough rep to post without CAPTCHA. Make it higher if you have to.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pragmatically, they are great for packing and unpacking values (&lt;code&gt;x,y=coord&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In combination with dictionaries (hash tables), they allow forms of mapping that would otherwise require many levels of association.  For example, consider marking that (x,y) has been found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// PHP
if (!isset($found[$x])) {
    $found[$x] = Array();
    $found[$x][$y] = true;
} else if (!isset($found[$x][$y])) {
    $found[$x][$y] = true;
}


# Python
found[(x,y)] = True # parens added for clarity
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lists should be used with the expectation of operations on its contents (hence the various mentions of immutability).  One will want to pop, push, splice, slice, search, insert before, insert after, etc with a list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuples should be a low-level representation of an object, where simple comparisons are made, or operations such as extracting the n'th element or n elements in a predictable fashion, such as the coordinates example given earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, lists are not hashable, so the type of mapping done with dictionaries (hash tables in Perl, associative arrays in PHP) must be done with tuples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a simple example of tuples and dictionaries, together at last:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;"""
couple is a tuple of two people
doesLike is a dictionary mapping couples to True or False
"""
couple = "john", "jane"
doesLike = dict()
doesLike[couple] = True
doesLike["jane", "john"] = False # unrequited love :'(
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking that sufficiently strong AI could &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; figure out the right answer from the context.  e.g. Strong AI could recognize that "35F" in this context is a temperature and not a hex number.  There are definitely cases where even strong AI would be unable to answer.  Those are the same cases where a human would be unable to answer, though (assuming &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; strong AI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it doesn't really matter, since we don't have strong AI.  :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another note I want to make about code coverage tools.  In a language like C# or Java where your have many get/set and similar methods, you should &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; be shooting for 100% coverage.  That means you are wasting too much time writing tests for trivial code.  You &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; want 100% coverage on your complex business logic.  If your full codebase is closer to 70-80% coverage, you are doing a good job.  If your code coverage tool allows multiple coverage metrics, the best one is 'block coverage' which measures coverage of 'basic blocks'.  Other types are class and method coverage (which don't give you as much information) and line coverage (which is too fine grain).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function foo($stuff) {

There's this idea that RSS fractured, and that somehow Atom fixes that problem.  But it doesn't.  Atom is just another RSS splinter.  A new name doesn't change the fact that it's just one more standard competing to do the same job, a job for which &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of the competing standards are sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one outside a fairly small group of people care at all which standard is used.  They just want it to work.  Atom, RSS 2.0, RSS 1.0, RSS 401(k), whatever.  As long as it works, the users are happy.  The RSS "brand" very much defines the entire feed category, though, so on the rare occasion that someone &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; know enough to choose, they will tend to choose RSS, because it's got "the name."  They will also tend to choose RSS 2.0, because it's got the bigger number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RSS, and especially RSS 2.0, are very much entrenched in the feed "industry."  Atom hasn't taken off because it doesn't bring much except a new name.  Why switch away from RSS when it works just fine?  And why even bother using Atom on new projects if RSS is sufficient?  Switching to a new feed format mostly means extra time spent learning the new format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hard part is handling re-occurring events, the row in the events table has an event_type field that tells you what kind of event it is, since an event can be for a single date only, OR a re-occuring event every x days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The main design challenge is handling re-occurring events.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a user views the calendar, using the month's view, how can I display all the events for the given month?  The query is going to be tricky, so I thought it would be easier to create another table and create a row for each and every event, including the re-occuring events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unix (in all flavors) is built on a single big idea:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Difficult problems can be solved by solving easy problems first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might recognize this as the Bottom-Up approach.  But Unix takes this philosophy to an extreme.  It's like living in a foreign country: you need to enculturate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, suppose you are working on a system that requires three separate servers.  Every morning, you type in three different commands to start them up.  At some point (hopefully on day two), you decide it's silly to type those same three commands each time you want to start work.  You might be tempted to write an application that controls those servers, but that's not the Unix way.  Instead, you should put those three commands in a script and move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, when you are ready to go into production, you want to show the startup process to your customer.  It's a bit embarrassing to show off the startup script, so you write a little GUI that has a startup button for the customer to press.  That button simply calls the script you wrote back on day two.  Problem solved!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that scenario strikes you as odd or horrifying, you are still thinking like a Windows programmer.  And in some ways it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; horrifying: a little helper script has become part of production code almost by accident.  But this sort of thing happens all the time on Unix systems and it mostly works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's not much point in listing commands that you need.  If you use the command line long enough, you'll figure out what you need fairly quickly.  Instead, I'd focus on trying to do everything in the shell for a while.  (I use ksh exclusively for writing scripts and bash for my interactive shell.  They're similar, but geared toward slightly different uses.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't believe anyone who does not understand pipelines can be said to be a Unix programmer.  A fairly common idiom that I found helpful to grokking pipelines was the output of find piped into xargs.  Right now, for instance, I need to remove a bunch of files that I own.  First I find the files:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ find . -user jericson
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I pipe the results to xargs to remove them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ find . -user jericson | xargs rm
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure to look at the &lt;strong&gt;-i&lt;/strong&gt; option for xargs as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that I broke the problem into two smaller problems and solved each one separately.  I actually ran the find command by itself to be sure I was looking at correct files.  Then I piped the results to the second command as input.  Using the pipeline avoids an intermediary file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn't thought of the case where you edit individual occurrences. It makes sense you would store the occurrences separately in that case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you do that, though, how far in the future do you store events? Do you pick an arbitrary date? Do you auto-generate the new occurrences the first time a user browses out into future months/years?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, how do you handle the case where the user wants to edit the whole series. "We've had a meeting every Tuesday morning at 10:30 but we're going to start meeting on Wednesday at 8"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is how I have designed my events table actually, but when thinking about it, say I have 100K users who have create events, this table will be hit pretty hard, especially if I am going to be sending out emails to remind people of their events (events can be for specific times of the day also!), so I could be polling this table every 15 minutes potentially!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I wanted to create another table that would expand out all the events/re-occuring events, this way I can simple hit that table and get the users months view of events without doing any complicated querying and business logic, AND it will make polling much more effecient also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is, should this secondary table be for the next day or month?  What makes more sense?  Since the maximum a user can view is a months view, I am leaning towards a table that writes out all the events for a given month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(ofcourse I will have to maintain this secondary table for any edits the user might make to the original events table).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ChanChan,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have designed it with the same sort of functionality actually, but I am just referring to how I will go about storing events, specifically how to handle re-occurring events.&lt;/p&gt;
