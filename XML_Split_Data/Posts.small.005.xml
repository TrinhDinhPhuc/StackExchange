&lt;p&gt;I've drawn up most of the plans but am having a hard time figuring out a way to handle the auditing system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it is being used internally only and you won't even be able to touch the db from outside the building we are not using a login system as the program will only be used once a user has already logged in to our internal network via Active Directory.  Knowing this, we're using &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9052/is-there-a-way-for-ms-access-to-grab-the-current-active-directory-user" rel="nofollow"&gt;a system to detect automatically the name of the Active Directory user&lt;/a&gt; and with their permissions in one of the DB tables, deciding what they can or cannot do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the actual audit table will have 3 columns (this design may change but for this question it doesn't matter); who (Active Directory User), when (time of addition/deletion/edit), what (what was changed)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is how should I be handling this.  Ideally I know I should be using a trigger so that it is impossible for the database to be updated without an audit being logged, however I don't know how I could grab the Active Directory User that way.  An alternate would be to code it directly into the Access source so that whenever something changes I run an INSERT statement.  Obviously that is flawed because if something happens to Access or the database is touched by something else then it will not log the audit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice, examples or articles that may help me would be greatly appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WebClient&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Nice and easy but you do not get any notification that the asynchronous upload has completed, and the &lt;code&gt;UploadProgressChanged&lt;/code&gt; event doesnt get called back with anything useful. The alternative is to convert your binary data to a string and use &lt;code&gt;UploadStringASync&lt;/code&gt; because then at least you get a &lt;code&gt;UploadStringCompleted&lt;/code&gt;, problem is you need a lot of ram for big files as its encoding all the data and uploading it in one go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HttpWebRequest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Bit more complicated but still does what is needed, problem I am getting is that even though it is called on a background thread (supposedly), it still seems to be blocking my UI and the whole browser until the upload has completed which doesnt seem quite right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normal .net does have some appropriate &lt;code&gt;WebClient&lt;/code&gt; methods for &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.webclient.onuploaddatacompleted.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;OnUploadDataCompleted&lt;/a&gt; and progress but these arent available in Silverlight .net ... big omission I think!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any solutions, I need to upload multiple binary files preferrably with a progress but I need to perform some actions when the files have completed their upload.&lt;/p&gt;

Before the doubters and dreamers cry out "how on earth?", relax -- I haven't found a way to make late static binding work -- I'm just working around it in the best way that I possibly can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I'm not currently using prepared statements for querying, because I couldn't come up with a way to pass a variable number of arguments to the &lt;code&gt;bind_params()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;bind_result()&lt;/code&gt; methods. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do I need to support a variable number of arguments, you ask? Because the superclass of my models (think of my solution as a hacked-up PHP ActiveRecord wannabe) is where the querying is defined, and so the find() method, for example, doesn't know how many parameters it would need to bind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I've already thought of building an argument list and passing a string to eval(), but I don't like that solution very much -- I'd rather just implement my own security checks and pass on statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any suggestions (or success stories) about how to get this done? If you can help me solve this first problem, perhaps we can tackle binding the result set (something I suspect will be more difficult, or at least more resource-intensive if it involves an initial query to determine table structure).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm currently using the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GD_Graphics_Library"&gt;GD&lt;/a&gt; function imagecopyresampled to take high resolution images, and cleanly resize them down to a size for web viewing (roughly 700 pixels wide by 700 pixels tall).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works great on small (under 2 MB) photos and the entire resize operation takes less than a second on the server. However, the site will eventually service photographers who may be uploading images up to 10 MB in size (or images up to 5000x4000 pixels in size).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing this kind of resize operation with large images tends to increase the memory usage by a very large margin (larger images can spike the memory usage for the script past 80 MB). Is there any way to make this resize operation more efficient? Should I be using an alternate image library such as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageMagick"&gt;ImageMagick&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function makeThumbnail($sourcefile, $endfile, $thumbwidth, $thumbheight, $quality){
// Takes the sourcefile (path/to/image.jpg) and makes a thumbnail from it
// and places it at endfile (path/to/thumb.jpg).

// Load image and get image size.
$img = imagecreatefromjpeg($sourcefile);
$width = imagesx( $img );
$height = imagesy( $img );

if ($width &amp;gt; $height) {
    $newwidth = $thumbwidth;
    $divisor = $width / $thumbwidth;
    $newheight = floor( $height / $divisor);
}
else {
    $newheight = $thumbheight;
    $divisor = $height / $thumbheight;
    $newwidth = floor( $width / $divisor );
}

// Create a new temporary image.
$tmpimg = imagecreatetruecolor( $newwidth, $newheight );

// Copy and resize old image into new image.
imagecopyresampled( $tmpimg, $img, 0, 0, 0, 0, $newwidth, $newheight, $width, $height );

// Save thumbnail into a file.
imagejpeg( $tmpimg, $endfile, $quality);

// release the memory
imagedestroy($tmpimg);
imagedestroy($img);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the button is clicked, the modal popup opens but the Button_Click event is never fired, so the modal doesn't get its session data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the two pages are separate, I can't call the ModalPopupExtender from the aspx.cs code, I can't reach the list of checkboxes from the ascx.cs code, and I don't see a way to populate my session variable and then programmatically activate some other hidden button or control which will then open my modal popup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The problem, I think, is that we need to parse perentheses, and yet they are not a binary operator? Should we take (2) as a single token, that evaluates to 2?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parens don't need to show up in the expression tree, but they do affect its shape. E.g., the tree for (1+2)+3 is different from 1+(2+3):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    +
   / \
  +   3
 / \
1   2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;versus&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    +
   / \
  1   +
     / \
    2   3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parentheses are a "hint" to the parser (e.g., per superjoe30, to "recursively descend")&lt;/p&gt;

If someone creates an event that occurs "every thursday, forever", you clearly cannot store all the future events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; try to generate the future events on demand, and populate the future events only when necessary to display them or to send notification about them.  However, if you are going to build the "on-demand" generation code anyway, why not use it all the time?  Instead of pulling from the event table, and then having to use on-demand event generation to fill in any new events that haven't been added to the table yet, just use the on-demand event generation exclusively.  The end result will be the same.  With this scheme, you only need to store the start and end dates and the event frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't see any way that you can avoid having on-demand event generation, so I can't see the utility in the event table.  If you want it for the sake of caching, then I think you're taking the wrong approach.  First, it's a poor cache because you can't avoid on-demand event generation anyway.  Second, you should probably be caching at a higher level anyway.  If you want to cache, then cache generated pages, not events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as making your polling more efficient, if you are only polling every 15 minutes, and your database and/or server can't handle the load, then you are already doomed.  There's no way your database will be able to handle users if it can't handle much, &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more frequent polling without breaking a sweat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of your list is ok, but the last few items need tweaking. ASP.NET adds &lt;em&gt;server-side&lt;/em&gt; functionality (for the most part) to your application. This lives outside of the browser and is thus quite powerful and easily shared with a variety of end-users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem (some say) with server-side processing is that your application must make a new HTTP request when you ask for an action to be performed. So if you click on a link to a page that yields a new set of data, you don't get instant results. The page reloads, or loads a separate page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javascript solves this to a degree--it allows you to respond to user input instantaneously. Do you want to display the sum of two numbers when the user clicks a button? You can do it with Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with Javascript is that it can't talk directly to databases, or explore your server's file system, or other stuff like that. It lives in the browser--period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AJAX bridges the gap between your user's browser and your server. With AJAX, &lt;em&gt;Javascript&lt;/em&gt; makes the HTTP request without refreshing your page or loading a new one. Javascript talks to a server-side script (not necessarily ASP, either--works with PHP, Rails, Coldfusion, etc.) and sends and receives information. And because Javascript isn't dependent on page loads, a quick, snappy AJAX script can almost give the feeling of a common desktop application, in which you don't have to wait for HTTP requests when performing simple actions on your application's data.&lt;/p&gt;

2  ( )

2   2

&lt;p&gt;But application config isn't always just key/value pairs.  Look at something like the tomcat configuration for what ports it listens on.  Here's an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can have any number of connectors.  Define more in the file and more connectors exist.  Don't define any more and no more exist.  There's no good way (imho) to do that with plain old key/value pairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your app's config is simple, then something simple like an INI file that's read into a dictionary is probably fine.  But for something more complex like server configuration, an INI file would be a huge pain to maintain, and something more structural like XML or YAML would be better.

Newbie question: what's the easiest way to make a custom editor for a table of records?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example: I have a bunch of data rows and want to change the "category" field on each -- maybe a dropdown, maybe a link, maybe the user types it in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Rails, I'd iterate over the rows to build a table, and would have a form for each row. The form would have an input box or dropdown, and submit the data to a controller like "/item/edit/15?category=foo" where 15 was the itemID and the new category was "foo".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm new to the ASP.NET model and am not sure of the "right" way to do this -- just the simplest way to get back the new data &amp;amp; save it off. Would I make a custom control and append it to each row? Any help appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, in the... i think service configuration... you want to specify that errors can be sent, you might be hitting an error that is something like the message size is to big, etc. You can fix that by fudging w/ the reader quotas and such. By default wsHttpBinding has a receive size quota of like 65k, so if the serialized data table's xml is more than that, it would throw an error (and i'm 95% sure the data table is more than 65k with data in it)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can change the settings for the reader quotas and such in the web.config / app.config or you can set it on a binding instance in code. But yeah, that's probably what your problem is, if you haven't changed it by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for me, getting people to contribute was a matter of doing something "unique."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW, once a commercial product became available that did what my project did, the contributions stopped.  I guess it was easier to buy the thing than to help build it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds like you want to know if Perl thinks a variable is numeric.  Here's a function that  traps that warning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sub is_number{
  my $n = shift;
  my $ret = 1;
  $SIG{"__WARN__"} = sub {$ret = 0};
  eval { my $x = $n + 1 };
  return $ret
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option is to turn off the warning locally:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  no warnings "numeric"; # Ignore "isn't numeric" warning
  ...                    # Use a variable that might not be numeric
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that non-numeric variables will be silently converted to 0, which is probably what you wanted anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

I would also say that I disagree in that it's wasted effort to include the configuration of the timer in an automated test suite of some kind.  There are a lot of edge cases when it comes to working with timing applications and it's very easy to create a false sense of security by only testing the things that are easy to test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would recommend having a suite of tests that runs the timer as well as the real action.  This suite will probably take a while to run and would likely not be something you would run all the time on your local machine.  But setting these types of things up on a nightly automated build can really help root out bugs before they become too hard to find and fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in short my answer to your question is don't worry about writing a few tests that do take a long time to run.  Unit test what you can and make that test suite run fast and often but make sure to supplement that with integration tests that run less frequently but cover more of the application and its configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

Pick another validation mechanism. Your comments on validators are kind of contradictory there - it's possible to use ASP.NET and still make choices for markup purity over development speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, with webforms, we've had the CSS Friendly Control Adapters for a few years which will modify the controls to render more semantic markup.

$("code").wrapInner("&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;");

&lt;p&gt;Firefox applies the formatting correctly, but IE puts the entire code block on one line. If I add an alert  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;alert($("code").html());
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see that IE has inserted some additional text into the pre tag:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;PRE jQuery1218834632572="null"&amp;gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd prefer to use &lt;code&gt;wrapInner()&lt;/code&gt; because I can then add a CSS class to the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag to handle all formatting, but if I use &lt;code&gt;wrap()&lt;/code&gt;, I have to put page formatting CSS in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag and text/font formatting in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, or Firefox and IE both choke. Not a huge deal, but I'd like to keep it as simple as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can set up 'static' Wordpress pages for contact information, various portfolios, a resume, etc.  This would also give you a blog if you want to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wordpress does give you the flexibility to "hide" the blogging part of it and use it basically as a simpler CMS.  For example, your root URL of example.com could point to a WP static page, while example.com/blog would be the actual blog pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you self-host Wordpress on your own domain (which I really would recommend instead of going through wordpress.com), it should be trivial to set up a few subdomains for extra content.  For example, downloads.example.com could host the actual downloads for projects you've developed linked from the Wordpress portfolio pages.  Similarly, if you're doing a lot of web work, a subdomain like lab.example.com or samples.example.com could then host various static (or dynamic) pages where you show off sandboxed pages that are not under the control of Wordpress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind though that you'll want to make your page look good.  A sloppy looking site can scare away potential clients, even if you are not looking to do any web work for them.&lt;/p&gt;

I would be creating each and every instance of an event in a table, and this table would be regenerated every month (so any event that was set to reoccurr 'forever' would be regenerated one month in advance using a windows service or maybe at the sql server level).
The polling won't only be done every 15 minutes, that might only be for polls related to email notifications.  When someone wants to view their events for a month, I will have to fetech all their events, and re-occuring events and figure out which events to display (since a re-occuring event might have been created 6 months ago, but relates to a month the user is viewing).&lt;/p&gt;

A vast amount of time tends to go into generating resources for clients that are common between requests (and even across clients); eliminating this runtime work can lead to dramatic speed increases. You can dump the generated resource (or resource fragment) into a file outside the web tree, and then read it back in when needed. Obviously, some profiling will be needed to ensure this is actually faster than regeneration - forcing the web server back to disk regularly can be detrimental, so the resource really does need to have heavy reuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might also be surprised how much time is spent inside badly written database queries; time common generated queries and see if they can be rewritten. The amount of time spent executing actual PHP code is generally pretty limited, unless you're using some sub-optimal algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither of these are limited to PHP, though some of the PHP "magicy" approaches/functions can over-protect one from thinking about these concerns. For example, I recently updated a script that was using array_search to use a binary search over a sorted array, and gained the expected exponential speedup.&lt;/p&gt;

Here are his 3 reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I've seen a number of developers confused, not knowing whether to use &lt;strong&gt;string&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;String&lt;/strong&gt; in their code. Because in C# the string (a keyword) maps exactly to System.String (an FCL type), there is no difference and either can be used.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In C#, &lt;strong&gt;long&lt;/strong&gt; maps to &lt;strong&gt;System.Int64&lt;/strong&gt;, but in a different programming language, &lt;strong&gt;long&lt;/strong&gt; could map to an &lt;strong&gt;Int16&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Int32&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact, C++/CLI does in fact treat long as an &lt;strong&gt;Int32&lt;/strong&gt;. Someone reading source code in one language could easily misinterpret the code's intention if he or she were used to programming in a different programming language. In fact, most languages won't even treat &lt;strong&gt;long&lt;/strong&gt; as a keyword and won't compile code that uses it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The FCL has many methods that have type names as part of their method names. For example, the &lt;strong&gt;BinaryReader&lt;/strong&gt; type offers methods such as &lt;strong&gt;ReadBoolean&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;ReadInt32&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;ReadSingle&lt;/strong&gt;, and so on, and the &lt;strong&gt;System.Convert&lt;/strong&gt; type offers methods such as &lt;strong&gt;ToBoolean&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;ToInt32&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;ToSingle&lt;/strong&gt;, and so on. Although it's legal to write the following code, the line with float feels very unnatural to me, and it's not obvious that the line is correct:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;BinaryReader br = new BinaryReader(...);
float val  = br.ReadSingle(); // Ok, but feels unnatural
Single val = br.ReadSingle(); // OK and feels good
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you have it. I think these are all really good points. I however, don't find myself using Jeffrey's advice in my own code. Maybe I am too stuck in my C# world but I end up trying to make my code look like the framework code.&lt;/p&gt;

Summer: Any Day
Fall: Tues, Thurs, Sat&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I was writing this in PHP I would use arrays like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;//M=Monday,t=Tuesday,T=Thursday.... etc
$schedule["A"]["Winter"]='M';
$schedule["A"]["Spring"]='tTS';
$schedule["A"]["Summer"]='Any';
$schedule["A"]["Fall"]='tTS';
$schedule["B"]["Winter"]='t';
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I COULD make the days arrays (array("Tuesday","Thursday","Saturday")) etc, but it is not necessary for what I'm really trying to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also need to setup arrays to determine what season I'm in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$seasons["Summer"]["start"]=0501;
$seasons["Summer"]["end"]=0801;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can anyone suggest a really cool way to do this? I will have today's date and the group letter.  I will need to get out of my function a day (M) or a series of days (tTS), (Any).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, folks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;asp:DataGrid ID="GridView1" runat="server" AutoGenerateColumns="False"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;Columns&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;asp:BoundColumn DataField="RuleID" Visible="False" HeaderText="RuleID"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/asp:BoundColumn&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;asp:TemplateColumn HeaderText="Category"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;ItemTemplate&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;!-- in case we want to display an image --&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;asp:Literal ID="litImage" runat="server"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/asp:Literal&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;asp:DropDownList ID="categoryListDropdown" runat="server"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/asp:DropDownList&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;/ItemTemplate&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/asp:TemplateColumn&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;/Columns&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/asp:DataGrid&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This creates a datagrid. We can then bind it to a data source (DataTable in my case) and use things like &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;foreach (DataGridItem item in this.GridView1.Items)
{
     DropDownList categoryListDropdown = ((DropDownList)item.FindControl("categoryListDropdown"));
     categoryListDropdown.Items.AddRange(listItems.ToArray());
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to populate the intial dropdown in the data grid. You can also access item.Cells[0].text to get the RuleID in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes for myself: The ASP.NET model does everything in the codebehind file. At a high level you can always iterate through GridView1.Items to get each row, and item.findControl("ControlID") to query the value stored at each item, such as after pressing an "Update" button.&lt;/p&gt;

I'll get at it below, but thanks to the two fellas who replied. I think that Stack Overflow is a fantastic site already--I hope more Mac developers find their way in once the beta is over--this could be a great resource for other developers looking to transition to the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I did, as suggested by Danny, find my answer in delegation. What I didn't understand from Danny's post was that there are a set of delegate-enabled methods in the delegating object, and that the delegate must implement said events. And so for a TextView, I was able to find the method textDidChange, which accomplished what I wanted in an even better way than simply capturing key presses would have done. So if I implement this in my controller:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- (void)textDidChange:(NSNotification *)aNotification;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can respond to the text being edited. There are, of course, other methods available, and I'm excited to play with them, because I know I'll learn a whole lot as I do. Thanks again, guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://zips.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow" title="Araxis Merge"&gt;&lt;a href="http://zips.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://zips.sourceforge.net/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I don't know how current it is, or you can use one of many providers. We have an annual subscription to &lt;a href="http://www.ZipCodeDownload.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;ZipCodeDownload.com&lt;/a&gt;, and for maybe $100 we get monthly updates with the latest Zip Code data complete with Lat/Longs of the centroid of the zip code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for querying for all zips within a certain radius, you are going to need a spatial library of some sort. If you just have a table of zips with lats/longs, you will need a database-oriented mechanism. SQL Server 2008 has the capability built in, and there are &lt;a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=MsSqlSpatial" rel="nofollow"&gt;open source libraries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.spatialdb.com/default.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1" rel="nofollow"&gt;commercial libraries&lt;/a&gt; that will add such capabilities to SQL Server 2005. The open source database PostgreSQL has a project, PostGIS that adds this capability to that database. It is here: &lt;a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://postgis.refractions.net/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other database platforms probably have similar projects, but those are the ones I am aware of. With one of these DB based libraries you should be able to directly query for any zip codes (or any rows of any kind that have lat/long columns) within a given radius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to go a different route you can use spatial tools with a mapping library. There are open source options here as well, such as &lt;a href="http://www.codeplex.com/SharpMap" rel="nofollow"&gt;SharpMap&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://opensourcegis.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;many others&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Open+Source+GIS+tools" rel="nofollow"&gt;Google can help out&lt;/a&gt;) that can use the free Tiger maps for the united states as the data source. However, this route is somewhat more complicated and possibly less performant if all you need is a radius search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you may want to look into a web service. This, as you say, is a common need, and I imagine there are any number ob web services that you can subscribe to that can provide all zip codes in a given radius from a provided zip code. A quick Google search turned up this:
&lt;a href="http://www.zip-codes.com/free-zip-code-tools.asp#radius" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.zip-codes.com/free-zip-code-tools.asp#radius" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.zip-codes.com/free-zip-code-tools.asp#radius&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
But there are &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=all+zip+codes+in+radius" rel="nofollow"&gt;MANY resources to be had for the searching&lt;/a&gt; on this subject.&lt;/p&gt;

"I have a problem: I don't have a web site about myself.". Define what you need to do to solve that problem, learn the basics, and do it. Then, define a new problem, which probably relies on the solution to the first problem, find what you need to do, and do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how all technology professionals evolve. My first website was a personal site with nothing but text. Then I added some jokes and some movie quotes. Then I got tired of man-handling all the updates to I learned how to put them into a database and retrieve them from the database for display. It goes on and on. &lt;/p&gt;

This should work in any langauge that supports multi-dimensional arrays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If using named constants, where, for example: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int A = 0;
int B = 1;
int C = 2;
int D = 3;

int Spring = 0; 
int Summer = 1;
int Winter = 2; 
int Fall = 3;
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the constants serve as more readable array subscripts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;schedule[A][Winter]="M";
schedule[A][Spring]="tTS";
schedule[A][Summer]="Any";
schedule[A][Fall]="tTS";
schedule[B][Winter]="t";
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using enumerated types:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;enum groups
{
  A = 0,
  B = 1,
  C = 2,
  D = 3

enum seasons

  Winter = 3

&lt;p&gt;I don't have a lot of DB background, but I am working with databases a lot recently, and I've been finding that a lot of the queries can be improved just by adding indexes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are using DB2, and there is a command called db2expln and db2advis, the first will indicate whether table scans vs index scans are being used, and the second will recommend indexes you can add to improve performance.  I'm sure MySQL has similar tools...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, if this is something you haven't considered yet, it has been helping a lot with me... but if you've already gone this route, then I guess it's not what you are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is a "materialized view" (or as they call it in DB2), which lets you specify a table that is essentially built of parts from multiple tables.  Thus, rather than normalizing the actual columns, you could provide this view to access the data... but I don't know if this has severe performance impacts on inserts/updates/deletes (but if it is "materialized", then it should help with selects since the values are physically stored separately).&lt;/p&gt;

It sounds like you've already done a lot of optimizing, but if not you can use MySQL's &lt;a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/explain.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;EXPLAIN&lt;/a&gt; syntax to see what indexes are actually being used and what is slowing down your queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as going about normalizing data (whether you're using views or just duplicating data in a more efficient manner), I think starting with the slowest queries and working your way through is a good approach to take.&lt;/p&gt;

As far as I can tell, there is no such thing as a "droppable" in mootools. This means your events like 'enter', 'leave' and 'drop' won't work. (These are events on the drag object)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you change those names to events that elements in mootools have (as in, DOM events) your code works perfectly. For instance, if you change 'enter' and 'leave'  to  'mouseover' and 'mouseout', your events fire with no problem. (Opera 9.51 on Windows Vista)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This appears to be the revelant line in the documentation for this, which stats to use DOM events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://docs.mootools.net/Element/Element.Event#Element%3aaddEvents" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://docs.mootools.net/Element/Element.Event#Element:addEvents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, on that page, is a link to the events that regular elements can have&lt;/p&gt;

Just consider each piece of your array an object, or, at the very least, the first level of the array as an object and each sub level as variables inside the object. The build a data structure that you populate with said objects and access the objects through the data structure's given accessors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Schedule
{
  private String group;
  private String season;
  private String rundays;
  public Schedule() { this.group = null; this.season = null; this.rundays= null; }
  public void setGroup(String g) { this.group = g; }
  public String getGroup() { return this.group; }
  ...
}

public ArrayList&amp;lt;Schedule&amp;gt; schedules = new ArrayList&amp;lt;Schedule&amp;gt;();
Schedule s = new Schedule();
s.setGroup(...);
...
schedules.add(s);
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course that probably isn't right either. I'd make each season an object, and maybe each weekday list as an object too. Anyway, its more easily reused, understood, and extensible than a hobbled-together Hashtable that tries to imitate your PHP code. Of course, PHP has objects too, and you should use them in a similar fashion instead of your uber-arrays, wherever possible. I do understand the temptation to cheat, though. PHP makes it so easy, and so fun!&lt;/p&gt;

The same app on other servers does not exhibit this behavior. This happens on WebSphere and Tomcat.  The environment is tricky to set up so it is difficult to try to do something like profiling within Eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to profile (or some other method of inspecting) an existing Java app running in Tomcat to find out what methods are being executed while it's in this spinwait kind of state?  The app is only executing one method when it gets in this state (vendor's method). Vendor can't replicate the behavior (of course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using JConsole I was able to determine who was running and what they were doing.  It took me a few hours to then figure out why it was doing it.  The problem ended up being that the vendor's API jar that was being used did not match exactly to the the database configuration that it was using.  It was defaulting to having tracing and performance monitoring enabled on the servers that had the slight mis-match in configuration.  I used a different jar and all is well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So thanks, Joshua, for your answer. JConsole was extremely easy to setup and use to monitor an existing application. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Cringe - I did some experimenting with some of the options you suggested.  I had some problems with getting JProfiler set up, it looks good (but pricey).  Going forward I went ahead and added the Eclipse Profiler plugin and I'll be looking over the different open source profilers to compare functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

Concepts, I took to immediately.  But miss a closing brace?  Easy to do, and often hard to debug, in a non-trivial program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my humble advice is: don't understimate the basics (like good typing). It sounds remedial, and even silly, but it saved me so much grief early in my learning process when I stumbled upon the simple technique of typing the complete "skeleton" of a code structure and then just filling it in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an "if" statement in Python, start with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if  :
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In C/C++/C#/Java:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if () 
{

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Pascal/Delphi:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;If () Then
Begin

End
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, type between the opening and closing tokens.  Once this becomes a solid habit, so you do it without thinking, more of the brain is freed up to do the fun stuff.  Not a very flashy bit of advice to post, I admit, but one that I have personally seen do a lot of good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but maybe you should stick the data in a properties file.  I'm not against hardcoding this data in your source files but, as you noticed, Java can be pretty wordy when it comes to nested Collections.  Your file might looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A.Summer=M&lt;br /&gt;
  A.Spring=tTS&lt;br /&gt;
  B.Summer=T&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't like this idea, maybe you can do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class WaterScheduler
{
  private static final Map&amp;lt;String, String&amp;gt; GROUP2SEASON = new HashMap&amp;lt;String, String&amp;gt;();

  private static void addEntry(String group, String season, String value)
  {
    GROUP2SEASON.put(group + "." + season, value);
  }

}

For example, there are exactly four seasons, and they don't &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;store&lt;/em&gt; anything.  How does it simplify anything to make them objects?  Wing is quite right that these should probably be &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;constants&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (or maybe enums).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Bruce needs, at it's heart, is simply a lookup table.  He doesn't need a hierarchy of objects and interfaces; he needs a way to look up a schedule based on a season and a group identifier.  Turning things into objects only makes sense if they have responsibilities or state.  If they have neither, then they are simply identifiers, and building special objects for them just makes the codebase larger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; build, e.g., &lt;code&gt;Group&lt;/code&gt; objects that each contain a set of schedule strings (one for each season), but if all the &lt;code&gt;Group&lt;/code&gt; object does is provide lookup functionality, then you've reinvented the lookup table in a much less intuitive fashion.  If he has to look up the group, and then lookup the schedule, all he has is a two-step lookup table that took longer to code, is more likely to be buggy, and will be harder to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

Have you analyzed the query plan to see if you are missing any?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/explain.html"&gt;&lt;a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/explain.html"&gt;http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/explain.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, once you are satisifed with your indexes and have exhausted all other avenues, de-normalization might be the right answer.  If you just have one or two queries that are problems, a manual approach is probably appropriate, whereas some sort of data warehousing tool might be better for creating a platform to develop data cubes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a site I found that touches on the subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meansandends.com/mysql-data-warehouse/?link_body%2Fbody=%7Bincl%3AAggregation%7D"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meansandends.com/mysql-data-warehouse/?link_body%2Fbody=%7Bincl%3AAggregation%7D"&gt;http://www.meansandends.com/mysql-data-warehouse/?link_body%2Fbody=%7Bincl%3AAggregation%7D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a simple technique that you can use to keep denormalizing queries simple, if you're just doing a few at a time (and I'm not replacing your OLTP tables, just creating a new one for reporting purposes).  Let's say you have this query in your application:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;select a.name, b.address from tbla a 
join tblb b on b.fk_a_id = a.id where a.id=1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could create a denormalized table and populate with almost the same query:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;create table tbl_ab (a_id, a_name, b_address); 
-- (types elided)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the underscores match the table aliases you use&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;insert tbl_ab select a.id, a.name, b.address from tbla a
join tblb b on b.fk_a_id = a.id 
-- no where clause because you want everything
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then to fix your app to use the new denormalized table, switch the dots for underscores.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;select a_name as name, b_address as address 
from tbl_ab where a_id = 1;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For huge queries this can save a lot of time and makes it clear where the data came from, and you can re-use the queries you already have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, I'm only advocating this as the last resort.  I bet there's a few indexes that would help you.  And when you de-normalize, don't forget to account for the extra space on your disks, and figure out when you will run the query to populate the new tables.  This should probably be at night, or whenever activity is low.  And the data in that table, of course, will never exactly be up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Yet another edit]  Don't forget that the new tables you create need to be indexed too!  The good part is that you can index to your heart's content and not worry about update lock contention, since aside from your bulk insert the table will only see selects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;HEADERS\n
\n
BODY
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, the first blank line (double newline) is the separator between the HEADERS and the BODY.  A HEADER looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;HSTRING:HTEXT
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HSTRING always starts at the beginning of a line and doesn't contain any white space or colons.  HTEXT can contain a wide variety of text, including newlines as long as the newline char is followed by whitespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "BODY" is really just any data that follows the first double newline.  (There are different rules if you are transmitting mail via SMTP, but processing it over a pipe you don't have to worry about that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in really simple, circa-1982 &lt;a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc822.html"&gt;RFC822&lt;/a&gt; terms, an email looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;HEADER: HEADER TEXT
HEADER: MORE HEADER TEXT
  INCLUDING A LINE CONTINUATION
HEADER: LAST HEADER

THIS IS ANY
ARBITRARY DATA
(FOR THE MOST PART)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most modern email is more complex than that though.  Headers can be encoded for charsets or &lt;a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2047.html"&gt;RFC2047&lt;/a&gt; mime words, or a ton of other stuff I'm not thinking of right now.  The bodies are really hard to roll your own code for these days to if you want them to be meaningful.  Almost all email that's generated by an MUA will be &lt;a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2045.html"&gt;MIME&lt;/a&gt; encoded.  That might be uuencoded text, it might be html, it might be a uuencoded excel spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps provide a framework for understanding some of the very elemental buckets of email.  If you provide more background on what you are trying to do with the data I (or someone else) might be able to provide better direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing i discovered earlier this year on our MySQL databases was the power of composite indexes. For example, if you are reporting on order numbers over date ranges, a composite index on the order number and order date columns could help. I believe MySQL can only use one index for the query so if you just had separate indexes on the order number and order date it would have to decide on just one of them to use. Using the EXPLAIN command can help determine this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give an indication of the performance with good indexes (including numerous composite indexes), i can run queries joining 3 tables in our database and get almost instant results in most cases. For more complex reporting most of the queries run in under 10 seconds. These 3 tables have 33 million, 110 million and 140 millions rows respectively. Note that we had also already normalised these slightly to speed up our most common query on the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More information regarding your tables and the types of reporting queries may allow further suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Adding a database is an incredibly heavyweight way to solve a problem that fits easily into a text file (or even directly into the source). There are 5 groups and 4 seasons. That means there are going to be a total of 20 records in the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the database engines I linked to are implemented entirely in Java and can be embedded in an application just by including a jar file.  It's a little heavyweight, sure, but it's a lot more scalable and easier to maintain.  Just because there are 20 records today doesn't mean there won't be more later due to changing requirements or feature creep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If in a few weeks or months you decide you want to add, say, time of day watering restrictions, it will be much easier to add that functionality if you're already using a database.  Even if that never happens, then you've spent a few hours learning how to embed a database in an application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Two of the database engines I linked to are implemented entirely in Java and can be embedded in an application just by including a jar file. It's a little heavyweight, sure, but it's a lot more scalable and easier to maintain. Just because there are 20 records today doesn't mean there won't be more later due to changing requirements or feature creep.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;If in a few weeks or months you decide you want to add, say, time of day watering restrictions, it will be much easier to add that functionality if you're already using a database. Even if that never happens, then you've spent a few hours learning how to embed a database in an application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embedding a DB in Java doesn't make it easier to maintain.  There's now an additional code dependency that did not previously exist.  Updating the set of schedules is now more difficult, as either a custom tool must be coded or a DB-specific interface must be used, whereas previous notepad.exe was sufficient.  Scalability is not a concern here, either.  The needs of this system could increase by a million and the flat file would still work just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, it's possible that in the future needs will evolve to the point that it's worth moving to a database.  That's when you make the change.  Trying to future-proof an application never works, because we &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; assume incorrectly about future needs.  We can't say it'll only take a few hours to embed the database either, because we suck at estimating schedules, too.  If there even comes a time when the database is appropriate, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; refactor the code to use a database.

This way you can visualize the concept of dereferencing the pointer (opening the mailbox). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance following a linked list:
1) start with your paper with the address
2) Go to the address on the paper
3) Open the mailbox to find a new piece of paper with the next address on it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a linear linked list, the last mailbox has nothing in it (end of the list). In a circular linked list, the last mailbox has the address of the first mailbox in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that step 3 is where the dereference occurs and where you'll crash or go wrong when the address is invalid. Assuming you could walk up to the mailbox of an invalid address, imagine that there's a black hole or something in there that turns the world inside out :)&lt;/p&gt;

So I'm developing a web method that needs a complex type passed into it and returned from it.  The two options I'm toying with are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pass and return &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; business objects with both data and behavior.  When wsdl.exe is run, it will automatically create proxy classes that contain just the data portion, and these will be automatically converted to and from my real business objects on the server side.  On the client side, they will only get to use the dumb proxy type, and they will have to map them into some real business objects as they see fit.  A big drawback here is that if I "own" both the server and client side, and I want to use the same set of real business objects, I can run into certain headaches with name conflicts, etc.  (Since the real objects and the proxies are named the same.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forget trying to pass "real" business objects.  Instead, just create simple DataTransfer objects which I will map back and forth to my real business objects manually.  They still get copied to new proxy objects by wsdl.exe anyway, but at least I'm not tricking myself into thinking that web services can natively handle objects with business logic in them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way - Does anyone know how to tell wsdl.exe to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; make a copy of the object?  Shouldn't we be able to just tell it, "Hey, use this existing type right over here. Don't copy it!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I've kinda settled on #2 for now, but I'm curious what you all think.  I have a feeling there are &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; better ways to do this in general, and I may not even be totally accurate on all my points, so please let me know what your experiences have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: I just found out that VS 2008 has an option to reuse existing types when adding a "Service Reference", rather than creating brand new identical type in the proxy file. Sweet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;That is how I have designed my events table actually, but when thinking about it, say I have 100K users who have create events, this table will be hit pretty hard, especially if I am going to be sending out emails to remind people of their events (events can be for specific times of the day also!), so I could be polling this table every 15 minutes potentially!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Databases do exception jobs of handling sets of data, so i wouldn't be too worried about that. What you should do is use this as your primary table, and then as events expire then move them into another table (like an archive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next thing is you want to try is to query the db as little as possible, so move the information into a caching tier (like &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/cc655792.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;velocity&lt;/a&gt;) and just persist data to the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, you can partition the information across multiple databases for scaling purposes. ie users 1-10000 calendars exist on server 1, 10001 - 20000 exist on server 2, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's how i would scale a solution like this, but i still think the original solution i proposed is the way to go, it's just how you scale it that becomes the question.&lt;/p&gt;

                result = formatter.Deserialize(zip) as T;
            }

        return result;
    }

        }

        return result;
    }
}

&lt;p&gt;Then you'd just pass the transfer object that would have the type name. So you could do something like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[WebMethod]
public void ReceiveData(TransferObject data)
{
    Type originType = Type.GetType(data.Type);
    object item = CompressedSerializer.Decompress&amp;lt;object&amp;gt;(data.Data);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;right now the compressed serializer uses generics to make it strongly typed, but you could make a method easily to take in a Type object to deserialize using originType above, all depends on your implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hope this gives you some ideas. Oh, and to answer your other question, wsdl.exe doesn't support reusing types, WCF does though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting idea... passing a serialized version of the object instead of the (wsdl-ed) object itself.  In a way, I like its elegance, but in another way, it seems to defeat the purpose of exposing your web service to potential third parties or partners or whatever.  How would they know what to pass?  Would they have to rely purely on documentation?  It also loses some of the "heterogeneous client" aspect, since the serialization is very .Net specific.

&lt;p&gt;i found out that MMS (not SMS) messages sent from my phone are just standard emails, so i have a system that reads the incoming email, checks the from (to only allow from my phone), and uses the body part to run different commands on my server. its sort of like a remote control by email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;because the system is designed to send pictures, its got a bunch of differently encoded parts. a mms.smil.txt part, a text/plain (which is useless, just says 'this is a html message'), a application/smil part (which the part that phones would pic up on), a text/html part with a advertisement for my carrier, then my message, but all wrapped in html, then finally a textfile attachment with my plain message (which is the part i use) (if i shove an image as an attachment in the message, its put at attachment 1, base64 encoded, then my text portion is attached as attachment 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i had it working with the exact mail format from my carrier, but when i ran a message from someone elses phone through it, it failed in a whole bunch of miserable ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i have other projects i'd like to extend this phone-&gt;mail-&gt;parse-&gt;command system to, but i need to have a stable/solid/generic parser to get the different parts out of the mail to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my end goal would be to have a function that i could feed the raw piped mail into, and get back a big array with associative sub-arrays of headers var:val pairs, and one for the body text as a whole string&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the more and more i search on this, the more i find the same thing: giant overdeveloped mail handling packages that do everything under the sun thats related to mails, or useless (to me, in this project) tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you pass round a reference type there is only one actually stored.  All the code that accesses the instance is accessing the same one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you pass round a value type each one is a copy. All the code is working on it's own copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be shown with an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;struct MyStruct 
{
    string MyProperty { get; set; }
}

void ChangeMyStruct(MyStruct input) 
{ 
   input.MyProperty = "new value";
}

...

// Create value type
MyStruct testStruct = new MyStruct { MyProperty = "initial value" }; 

ChangeMyStruct(testStruct);

// Value of testStruct.MyProperty is still "initial value"
// - the method changed a new copy of the structure.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a class this would be different&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class MyClass 
{
    string MyProperty { get; set; }
}

void ChangeMyClass(MyClass input) 
{ 
   input.MyProperty = "new value";
}

...

// Create reference type
MyClass testClass = new MyClass { MyProperty = "initial value" };

ChangeMyClass(testClass);

// Value of testClass.MyProperty is now "new value" 
// - the method changed the instance passed.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classes can be nothing - the reference can point to a null.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Structs are the actual value - they can be empty but never null. For this reason structs always have a default constructor with no parameters - they need a 'starting value'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in java, you may need to convert an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; value into an &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt; (boxing) if you want to store it in a &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt; because primitives can't be stored in a &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt;, only objects.  But when you want to get it back out of the &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt; you may want to get the value as an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and not an &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt; so you would unbox it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boxing and unboxing is not inherently &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, but it is a tradeoff.  Depending on the language implementation, it can be slower and more memory intensive than just using primitives.  However, it may also allow you to use higher level data structures and achieve greater flexibility in your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, it is most commonly discussed in the context of Java's (and other language's) "autoboxing/autounboxing" feature.  Here is a &lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/autoboxing.html"&gt;java centric explanation of autoboxing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often you can't rely on what the type of variable a function will consume, so you need to use an object variable which extends from the lowest common denominator - in .Net this is &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; is a class and stores its contents as a reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; notBoxed = new List&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; { 1, 2, 3 };
int i = notBoxed[1]; // this is the actual value

List&amp;lt;object&amp;gt; boxed = new List&amp;lt;object&amp;gt; { 1, 2, 3 };
int j = (int) boxed[1]; // this is an object that can be 'unboxed' to an int
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While both these hold the same information the second list is larger and slower. Each value in the second list is actually a reference to an &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; that holds the &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is called boxed because the &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; is wrapped by the &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt;. When its cast back the &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; is unboxed - converted back to it's value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For value types (i.e. all &lt;code&gt;structs&lt;/code&gt;) this is slow, and potentially uses a lot more space. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reference types (i.e. all &lt;code&gt;classes&lt;/code&gt;) this is far less of a problem, as they are stored as a reference anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further problem with a boxed value type is that it's not obvious that you're dealing with the box, rather than the value. When you compare two &lt;code&gt;structs&lt;/code&gt; then you're comparing values, but when you compare two &lt;code&gt;classes&lt;/code&gt; then (by default) you're comparing the reference - i.e. are these the same instance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be confusing when dealing with boxed value types:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int a = 7;
int b = 7;

if(a == b) // Evaluates to true, because a and b have the same value

object c = (object) 7;
object d = (object) 7;

if(c == d) // Evaluates to false, because c and d are different instances
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's easy to work around:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if(c.Equals(d)) // Evaluates to true because it calls the underlying int's equals

if(((int) c) == ((int) d)) // Evaluates to true once the values are cast
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However it is another thing to be careful of when dealing with boxed values.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;How do you know when you are 'done' capturing test cases?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't.You can't get to 100% except for the most trivial cases. Also 100% coverage (of lines, paths, conditions...) doesn't tell you you've hit all boundary conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, the test cases are not write-and-forget. &lt;strong&gt;Each time you find a bug, write an additional test.&lt;/strong&gt; Check it fails with the original program, check it passes with the corrected program and add it to your test set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An excerpt from &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0471469122" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Art of Software Testing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Glenford J. Myers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If an input condition specifies a range of values, write test cases for the ends of the range, and invalid-input test cases for situations just beyond the ends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If an input condition specifies a number of values, write test cases for the minimum and maximum number of values and one beneath and beyond these values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use guideline 1 for each output condition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use guideline 2 for each output condition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the input or output of a program is an ordered set focus attention on the first and last elements of the set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition, use your ingenuity to search for other boundary conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;I've only pasted the bare minimum for copyright reasons.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Points 3. and 4. above are very important. People tend to forget boundary conditions for the outputs. 5. is OK. 6. really doesn't help :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Short exam&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is more difficult than it looks. Myers offers this test:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The program reads three integer values from an input dialog. The three values represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The program displays a message that states whether the triangle is scalene, isosceles, or equilateral.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Remember that a scalene triangle is one where no two sides are equal, whereas an isosceles triangle has two equal sides, and an equilateral triangle has three sides of equal length. Moreover, the angles opposite the equal sides in an isosceles triangle also are equal (it also follows that the sides opposite equal angles in a triangle are equal), and all angles in an equilateral triangle are equal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write your test cases. How many do you have? Myers asks 14 questions about your test set and reports that highly qualified professional programmes average 7.8 out of a possible 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't highlight the whole text view at once - it's &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; slow. Also don't highlight the last edited text using -editedRange - it's very slow too if the user pastes a large body of text into the text view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead you need to highlight the visible text which is done like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;NSRect visibleRect = [[[textView enclosingScrollView] contentView] documentVisibleRect];
NSRange visibleRange = [[textView layoutManager] glyphRangeForBoundingRect:visibleRect inTextContainer:[textView textContainer]];
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you feed visibleRange to your highlighting code.&lt;/p&gt;

If you define the __autoload() function and use a class with some constants, you can call them where you need them. The only aggravating thing about this is that you have to type something a little longer, like &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;MyClass::MY_CONST

&lt;p&gt;The benefit is that if you ever decide to change the way that you handle new lines, you only have to change it in one place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, a possible negative is that you're calling including an extra function (__autoload()), running that function (when you reference the class), which then loads another file (your class file). That might be more overhead than it's worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I may offer a suggestion, it would be avoiding this sort of echoing that requires echoing tags (like &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;).

&lt;p&gt;This sounds like you're talking about log shipping instead of replication. For what you're planning on doing though I'd agree with &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1436/jeremy-mccollum" rel="nofollow" title="dp"&gt;Jeremy McCollum&lt;/a&gt; and say do transactional replication.

&lt;p&gt;Last year we went on a project where we used webservices, the fact is that we instantiated our webservices at the Sub New() procedure and it run it very well, however, sometimes some users claimed at us that they woke up from their chairs and when they returned and tried to continue on the application they received a timeout error message and they had to re-login again.&lt;/p&gt;

I think that's how I got hooked in the business... I could say that it was these first impressions based on such simplicity and coolness that made the goods that stick into my head for life. That's how basics in teaching programming should be taught... a simple process that yearns magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to my first CS 101, I started with notions of what an algorithm was by building a Tequila Sunrise (a step by step process that could be repeated at any time with the right ingredients, that will result in the same output), from there we move on to basic math functions using Scheme (like EHaskins was saying... start small and then build up), and from there to notions of loops, Boolean logic, structures and then building into concepts of objects and some simulation executions...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the good things about this approach is that language was not a goal but just a tool in the process of learning the concepts and basics of programming (just like operators, functions and else are in mathematics).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMHO learning the basics of programming and creating a foundation is probably the best thing you could teach  your brother, once the goal is covered then u can move on into a more general use language like python and teach them higher concepts like architecture and design patterns (make them natural in the process so he will get use to good practices from early stages and will see them as part of the process)... we are far from reinventing the warm water, but we always have to start by creating fire.&lt;/p&gt;

It has functions, which can provide scope for resolving names, and objects, which can contribute to the named data accessible in a given scope. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's your example, corrected:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var namespaces = { com: { example: { /* example.com's data */ } } }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a variable &lt;code&gt;namespaces&lt;/code&gt; being assigned an object literal. The object contains one property: &lt;code&gt;com&lt;/code&gt;, an object with one property: &lt;code&gt;example&lt;/code&gt;, an object which presumably would contain something interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you can type something like &lt;strong&gt;namespaces.com.example.&lt;em&gt;somePropertyOrFunctionOnExample&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and it'll all work. Of course, it's also ridiculous. You don't have a hierarchical namespace, you have an object containing an object containing an object with the stuff you actually care about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var com_example_data = { /* example.com's data */ };
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That works just as well, without the pointless hierarchy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now&lt;/strong&gt;, if you actually &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to build a hierarchy, you can try something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;com_example = com_example || {};
com_example.flags = com_example.flags || { active: false, restricted: true};

com_example.ops = com_example.ops || (function()

         destroyTheWorld: function() { /* ... */ }

First is, the thread might have transitioned from Running to StopRequested, which isn't fully stopped yet, so your logic doesn't create a new thread, and you're trying to start a thread which has just finished running or is about to finish running (neither of which is a valid state for restarting).&lt;/p&gt;

In essence, you're still running on the 2.0 CLR, but you're using the C# 3.0 compiler and linking against the 3.5 libraries.

&lt;p&gt;However, checking thread state is the wrong to do anything. I'm not entirely clear what you're trying to achieve but I will guess that you're waiting for a thread to terminate before restarting it. In that case you should do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mThread.Join();

&lt;p&gt;with the appropriate translations in N other languages (messages_fr.properties, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DRY violation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; - I have N references to my Struts action URLs instead of 1, which makes refactoring action URLs error-prone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mixed concerns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; - My application's markup is now in more than just my JSP files, making it difficult for a web specialist to tweak the markup (using CSS, etc).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-translation markup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; - Anytime I receive newly-translated text, I must decide what to surround with the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup. Easy for English but less so for unfamiliar languages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've considered adding placeholders in the messages file, like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;alert=Please update your {0} and {1}.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but then the words "address" and "contact information" would somehow need to be localized, wrapped with markup, and passed to my message tag - and I can't see an easy way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can I do to improve this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also should avoid extending System.Object as not all .NET languages will be able to call the extension method as an extension. (VB.NET for instance would need to call it as a regular static method on the static extension class.)&lt;/p&gt;

Considering you don't post the details behind the &lt;em&gt;check&lt;/em&gt; variable, it's impossible to know what might trigger this behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

We use CruiseControl.net (and are trying out TeamCity). The MSBuild task that we run for continuous integration automatically changes the build number for us, so the resulting build ZIP file contains a properly versioned set of DLLs and EXEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="http://www.codeplex.com/xunit/SourceControl/FileView.aspx?itemId=115610&amp;amp;changeSetId=20735"&gt;MSBuild file&lt;/a&gt; contains a UsingTask reference for a DLL which does regular expression replacements: (you're welcome to use this DLL, as it's covered by the MS-PL license as well)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
  &amp;lt;UsingTask
     AssemblyFile="3rdParty\CodePlex.MSBuildTasks.dll"
     TaskName="CodePlex.MSBuildTasks.RegexReplace"/&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we extract the build number, which is provided automatically by the CI system. You could also get your source control provider to provide the source revision number if you want, but we found the build # in the CI system was more useful, because not only can see the integration results by the CI build number, that also provides a link back to the changeset(s) which were included in the build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
 &amp;lt;!-- Cascading attempts to find a build number --&gt;

 &amp;lt;PropertyGroup Condition="'$(BuildNumber)' == ''"&gt;
   &amp;lt;BuildNumber&gt;$(BUILD_NUMBER)&amp;lt;/BuildNumber&gt;
 &amp;lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
 &amp;lt;PropertyGroup Condition="'$(BuildNumber)' == ''"&gt;
   &amp;lt;BuildNumber&gt;$(ccnetlabel)&amp;lt;/BuildNumber&gt;
 &amp;lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
 &amp;lt;PropertyGroup Condition="'$(BuildNumber)' == ''"&gt;
   &amp;lt;BuildNumber&gt;0&amp;lt;/BuildNumber&gt;
 &amp;lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(We try BUILD_NUMBER, which is from TeamCity, then ccnetlabel, which is from CC.net, and if neither is present, we default to 0, so that we can test the automated build script manually.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we have a task which sets the build number into a GlobalAssemblyInfo.cs file that we link into all of our projects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
 &amp;lt;Target Name="SetVersionNumber"&gt;
   &amp;lt;RegexReplace
       Pattern='AssemblyVersion\("(\d+\.\d+\.\d+)\.\d+"\)'
       Replacement='AssemblyVersion("$1.$(BuildNumber)")'
       Files='GlobalAssemblyInfo.cs'/&gt;
   &amp;lt;Exec Command="attrib -r xunit.installer\App.manifest"/&gt;
 &amp;lt;/Target&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This find the AssemblyVersion attribute, and replaces the a.b.c.d version number with a.b.c.BuildNumber. We will usually leave the source checked into the tree with the first three parts of the builder number fixed, and the fourth at zero (f.e., today it's 1.0.2.0).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your build process, make sure the SetVersionNumber task precedes your build task. At the end, we use our Zip task to zip up the build results so that we have a history of the binaries for every automated build.&lt;/p&gt;

Much like the Microsoft world (I'm guessing - we're a Java shop), if you get all your products from a single vendor you get the bonus of tight integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an example of how they've done interoperability, view their &lt;a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/features/interoperability.jsp" rel="nofollow" title="interoperability"&gt;interoperability page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough shilling. Generally speaking, I can summarize their general approach as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create issues in your bug tracker (ex: issue key of PROJ-123).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you commit code, add "PROJ-123" to your commit comment to indicate what bug this code change fixes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When your CI server checks out the code, scan the commit comments of the diffs. Record any strings matching the regex of your issue keys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the build completes, generate a report of what issue keys were found.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically to your second problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your CI doesn't doesn't have to put anything into your bug tracker. Bamboo doesn't put anything into JIRA. Instead, the Atlassian folks have provided a plugin to JIRA that will make a remote api call into Bamboo, asking the question "Bamboo, to what builds am I (a JIRA issue) related?". This is probably best explained with a &lt;a href="http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BAMBOO/Bamboo+2.1+Release+Notes#Bamboo2.1ReleaseNotes-LinkIssuesandBuilds" rel="nofollow" title="screenshot"&gt;screenshot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Structs are &lt;em&gt;value types&lt;/em&gt; and classes are &lt;em&gt;reference types&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general difference is that a &lt;em&gt;reference type&lt;/em&gt; lives on the heap, and a &lt;em&gt;value type&lt;/em&gt; lives inline, that is, wherever it is your variable or field is defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variable containing a &lt;em&gt;value type&lt;/em&gt; contains the entire &lt;em&gt;value type&lt;/em&gt; value. For a struct, that means that the variable contains the entire struct, with all its fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variable containing a &lt;em&gt;reference type&lt;/em&gt; contains a pointer, or a &lt;em&gt;reference&lt;/em&gt; to somewhere else in memory where the actual value resides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has one benefit, to begin with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;value types&lt;/em&gt; always contains a value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;reference types&lt;/em&gt; can contain a &lt;em&gt;null&lt;/em&gt;-reference, meaning that they don't refer to anything at all at the moment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internally, &lt;em&gt;reference type&lt;/em&gt;s are implemented as pointers, and knowing that, and knowing how variable assignment works, there are other behavioral patterns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;copying the contents of a &lt;em&gt;value type&lt;/em&gt; variable into another variable, copies the entire contents into the new variable, making the two distinct. In other words, after the copy, changes to one won't affect the other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;copying the contents of a &lt;em&gt;reference type&lt;/em&gt; variable into another variable, copies the reference, which means you now have two references to the same &lt;em&gt;somewhere else&lt;/em&gt; storage of the actual data. In other words, after the copy, changing the data in one reference will appear to affect the other as well, but only because you're really just looking at the same data both places&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you declare variables or fields, here's how the two types differ:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;variable: &lt;em&gt;value type&lt;/em&gt; lives on the stack, &lt;em&gt;reference type&lt;/em&gt; lives on the stack as a pointer to somewhere in heap memory where the actual memory lives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;class/struct-field: &lt;em&gt;value type&lt;/em&gt; lives inside the class, &lt;em&gt;reference type&lt;/em&gt; lives inside the class as a pointer to somewhere in heap memory where the actual memory lives.&lt;/li&gt;

During development we also had some European languages in mind like Dutch and German that tend to concatenate words into very long ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're currently investigating support for eastern languages: Chinese, Japanese, and so on. I understand that these use phonetic input converted to written characters. How does that work on the web? Do the same events fire while inputs and textareas are being edited (we're quite Ajax heavy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What conventions do users of these top-down languages expect online? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What effect does their dual-input (phonetic typing + conversion) have on web controls?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With RTL languages like Arabic do users expect the entire interface to be mirrored? For instance should things like OK/Cancel buttons be swapped and on the left? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key ideas for me is to have two source roots - one for production code and one for test code like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;MyProject/src/main/java/com/acme/Widget.java
MyProject/src/test/java/com/acme/WidgetTest.ava
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(here, both src/main/java and src/test/java are source roots).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your tests have package (or "default") level access to your classes under test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can easily package only your production sources into a JAR by dropping src/test/java as a source root.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One rule of thumb about class placement and packages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, well structured projects will be free of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_dependency"&gt;circular dependencies&lt;/a&gt;. Learn when they are bad (and when they are &lt;a href="http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000208.html"&gt;not&lt;/a&gt;), and consider a tool like &lt;a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=JDepend&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a"&gt;JDepend&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.hello2morrow.com/en/sonarj/sonarj.php"&gt;SonarJ&lt;/a&gt; that will help you eliminate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to install a Subversion server on your own, it looks like you have two options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subversions own protocol&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In either case, the problem isn't what the two do, but what the two &lt;em&gt;unintentionally do&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are bugs in Apache that allows an outside attacker to gain access to your data, then that is bad. If there are bugs in Subversions own server that allows the same, that is bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you need to do is consider &lt;em&gt;risk&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;consequences&lt;/em&gt; for the scenarios, and come up with a server setup that meets your requirements, if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cases you would at least have to consider would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bug in either system that allows an attacker to sink your server (example: something which makes your server use an inordinate amount of CPU time)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bug in either system that allows an attacker access to the data on that server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bug in either system that allows an attacker access to your domain (ie. all your servers and machines available from that public server)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current team I'm on does only does gross task estimation, so it's hard to track hours per days. I would say that, for my career, the time spent coding has been anywhere between 25% (mostly management) to 85%+ (working from home 4 days a week, get together for a meeting for half a day once a week). If I had to guess, though, the average is probably somewhere in the vicinity of 60%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest influence for me in time spent coding is the presence or absence of meetings. When I worked on agile projects with everybody in the same room, meetings tended to be ad-hoc and very short, so the time spent coding was very high. I also felt I spent less time -- sometimes a lot less time -- doing non-coding things when I was in a team room, because it's much easier to waste time, accidentally or otherwise, when nobody has a clear view of your monitor. :)&lt;/p&gt;

In listening to the Stack Overflow podcast, I heard Joel mention that FogBugz uses one database per client (so if there were 1000 clients, there would be 1000 databases).  What are the advantages of using this architecture?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that for some projects, clients need direct access to all of their data - in such an application, it's obvious that each client needs their own database.  However, for projects where a client does not need to access the database directly, are there any advantages to using one database per client?  It seems that in terms of flexibility, it's much simpler to use a single database with a single copy of the tables.  It's easier to add new features, it's easier to create reports, and it's just easier to manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pretty confident in the "one database for all clients" method until I heard Joel (an experienced developer) mention that his software uses a different approach -- and I'm a little confused with his decision...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've heard people cite that databases slow down with a large number of records, but any relational database with some merit isn't going to have that problem - especially if proper indexes and keys are used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any input is greatly appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

If you're not one of these people, well, then the benefit of a single database is obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this situation, benefits come from the encapsulation of each client. From the code perspective, each client exists in isolation - there is no possible situation in which a database update might overwrite, corrupt, retrieve or alter data belonging to another client. This also simplifies the model, as you don't need to ever consider the fact that records might belong to another client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also get benefits of separability - it's trivial to pull out the data associated with a given client ,and move them to a different server. Or restore a backup of that client when the call up to say "We've deleted some key data!", using the builtin database mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get easy and free server mobility - if you outscale one database server, you can just host new clients on another server. If they were all in one database, you'd need to either get beefier hardware, or run the database over multiple machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get easy versioning - if one client wants to stay on software version 1.0, and another wants 2.0, where 1.0 and 2.0 use different database schemas, there's no problem - you can migrate one without having to pull them out of one database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can think of a few dozen more, I guess. But all in all, the key concept is "simplicity". The product manages one client, and thus one database. There is never any complexity from the "But the database also contains other clients" issue. It fits the mental model of the user, where they exist alone. Advantages like being able to doing easy reporting on all clients at once, are minimal - how often do you want a report on the whole world, rather than just one client?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some of the features in this taglib
  are also available in the JavaServer
  Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL). The
  Struts team encourages the use of the
  standard tags over the Struts specific
  tags when possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could probably do this with the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; taglib.&lt;/p&gt;

    &amp;lt;/fmt:message&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/fmt:bundle&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside is that this isn't valid XML and yanking the values to variables involves more indirection, lookups and verbosity. This is not a good solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know Struts, but if it is anything like JavaServer Faces (same architect), then there is probably support for configuring a replacement control. I would either replace the existing control with a more flexible one or add a new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Anytime I receive newly-translated
  text, I must decide what to surround
  with the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no way you should be doing this and I see this as a fault in your translation process (I am an ex-localization engineer and ex-developer of localization tools). The &lt;code&gt;{0}&lt;/code&gt; characters should be included in the files that are sent to the translators. The localization guidelines should explain the string's context and the meaning of any variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can programmatically validate the property bundles on return. String-specific regex's might do the trick. It isn't outside the realms of possibility that "address" and "contact information" would swap order during translation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplest solution is to redesign the messages to render:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-html prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a href="/address.do"&amp;gt;Please update your address.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;a href="/contact.do"&amp;gt;Please update your contact information.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

I suppose I'm looking more at upgrade flexibility.  If you need to modify the schema to add a new feature (lets say for a web application) or to enhance existing features, it's simple to do in a single database.  If you had to replicate this change across 1000 separate databases, the chance of error increases.  What if an operation fails?  How long does it take to upgrade every client?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If proper backups are kept (or if your database was structured where data was never actually overwritten), restoring data for a particular client is trivial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplicity of the code, while important, doesn't really get extremely complicated.  Depending on the language used and the methodologies, it's simple to create objects that represent only that specific client (which store a particular Client ID) and the rest of the project only has to be coded for a single object (sort of like a single client).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scalability is something to consider - you're right that it's easy to take a single isolated database and move it to a different physical server; however, it's becoming increasingly easier to cluster servers together - and even without clustering, it seems like it'd be a small change to point each client at a database SERVER that hosts the universal database (so you could have two or three database servers hosting only a single database each, for instance).  This approach keeps the upgrade process limited to only three databases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;MyProject / src / main / resources / spring /&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;datasource.xml&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  -  My single data source bean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;persistence.xml&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  -  My DAOs/Repositories. Depends on &lt;code&gt;datasource.xml&lt;/code&gt; beans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;services.xml&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  -  Service layer implementations. These are usually the beans to which I apply transactionality using AOP. Depends on &lt;code&gt;persistence.xml&lt;/code&gt; beans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;controllers.xml&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  - My Spring MVC controllers. Depends on &lt;code&gt;services.xml&lt;/code&gt; beans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;views.xml&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; - My view implementations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list is neither perfect nor exhaustive, but I hope it illustrates the point. Choose whatever naming strategy and granularity works best for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my (limited) experience, I've seen this approach yeild the following benefits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clearer architecture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly named context files gives those unfamiliar with your project structure a reasonable 
place to start looking for bean definitions. Can make detecting circular/unwanted dependencies a little easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helps domain design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to add a bean definition, but it doesn't fit well in any of your context files, perhaps there's a new concept or concern emerging? Examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppose you want to make your Service layer transactional with AOP. Do you add those bean definitions to &lt;code&gt;services.xml&lt;/code&gt;, or put them in their own &lt;code&gt;transactionPolicy.xml&lt;/code&gt;? Talk it over with your team. Should your transaction policy be pluggable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add Acegi/Spring Security beans to your &lt;code&gt;controllers.xml&lt;/code&gt; file, or create a &lt;code&gt;security.xml&lt;/code&gt; context file? Do you have different security requirements for different deployments/environments?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can wire up a subset of your application for integration testing (ex: given the above files, to test the database you need to create only &lt;code&gt;datasource.xml&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;persistence.xml&lt;/code&gt; beans).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, you can annotate an integration test class as such:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;@ContextConfiguration(locations = { "/spring/datasource.xml" , "/spring/persistence.xml" })
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Works well with Spring IDE's Beans Graph&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having lots of focused and well-named context files makes it easy to create custom BeansConfigSets to visualize the layers of your app using Spring IDE's &lt;a href="http://springide.org/project/wiki/BeansGraph"&gt;Beans Graph&lt;/a&gt;. I've used this before to give new team members a high-level overview of our application's organization.&lt;/p&gt;

Because my company is not a software company it has little business reason to implement many of the measures software experts recommend companies engage for developer productivity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don't get private offices and dual 30 inch monitors. Our source control system is Microsoft Visual Source Safe. Enough said. On the other hand, I get to do a lot of things that fill out my day and add some variety to my job. I get involved in business analysis, project management, development, production support, international implementations, training support, team planning, and process improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd say I get 85% of my day to code, when I can focus and I have a major programming task. But more often I get about 50% of my day for coding. If production support (non coding-related) is heavy I may only get 15% of my day to code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the companies I've worked for were not actively engaged in evaluating agile processes or test-driven development, but they didn't do a good job of waterfall either; most of their developers worked like cut-and-paste cowboys with impugnity.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On occasion I do work from home and with kids, it's &lt;em&gt;horrible&lt;/em&gt;. I'm more productive at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My productivity is good, but could be better if the interruption factor and cost of mental context switching was removed. Production support and project management overhead both create those types of interruptions. But both are necessary parts of the job, so I don't think I can get rid of them. What I would like to consider is a restructuring of the team so that people on projects could focus on projects while the others could block the interruptions by being dedicated to support. And then swapping when the project is over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, no one wants to do support, so the other productivity improvement measure I'd wish for would be one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better testing tools/methodologies to speed up unit testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better business analysis tools/skills to improve the quality of new development and limit its contributions to the production support load &lt;/li&gt;

One is how do I create the solution to a programming problem and the other is how do I solve a problem that exists (ie debugging).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programming:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't think about implementation, yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you have all the information that you need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start breaking the problem down into pieces.  I use an outliner for this. Currently using &lt;a href="http://www.mylifeorganized.net/"&gt;My Life Organized&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't worry about solving the whole problem.  Start with what you know and keep it simple to begin with.  I use &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_Design_Language"&gt;PDL&lt;/a&gt; to describe the solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After you have completed a pass, keep going back to 2 and repeat. Using an outliner I can keep increasing the level of detail and easily move these details around as the solution becomes clearer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there are pieces of the puzzle that you don't have the answer for, add that to your outline and describe what the next step would be to solve that piece.  It may be more research, talking with someone, or getting more details from the users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go back to step 2 and repeat until you have your solution described.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement your solution in your language of choice.  You can probably use the outline as comments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debugging:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to do your best to understand what is really happening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compile a list of what you know to be true (facts).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do your best to make it repeatable as easily as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Come up with your best approach to attacking the problem (consult with others, google, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try your approach to fix the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it fixes it, then see if you can break it again, and then fix it for real.  Helps you prove you really understood and fixed the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it doesn't fix it, undo your changes, and go back to step 1 and repeat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few iterations you should completely understand the problem and know the best solution for your situation.  There are times when you just can't get it.  It's good to step away, sleep on it, and be prepared to attack it fresh.  Definitely talking it through and showing your issues to others can help you better understand the problem and get fresh ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If multiple windows can be open at one time, allow users to have them on separate screens. Seems obvious, but some very popular apps (e.g. Visual Studio) fail miserably at this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember the position of the last opened window, and open new windows on the same screen as before. However, sometimes users switch between multiple and single-display (e.g. docking a laptop with an external CRT), so watch cover this case as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider how your particular users work, and how having two maximized windows simultaneously might help. Often, there is a (fairly passive) window for reference (e.g. a web browser/help) and an active window for data entry (e.g. editor/database) that users switch between. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; put toolboxes/toolbars on a different window than objects they operate on (it's inconvenient to move the mouse so far).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I would disable the third textbox, as Rob Thomas said. If you're determined to do this, though, it wouldn't be difficult to set up a manual (read: hackish) solution. Once the tab key is pressed (if the focus is on the second textbox), set a variable inside your form. If the next object focused is then the third textbox, then you know exactly how it happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, it will lead to fewer problems. Sometimes you have to compromise your UI design to accommodate localization; sometimes you need to compromise your localization process to accommodate the UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any time a developer manually manipulates post-translation strings is a source of potentially expensive bugs. Cutting/pasting or string editing can result in character corruption, misplaced strings, etc. A translation defect needs the participation of outside parties to fix which involves cost and takes time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking on it, something like this might be less ugly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-html prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please update your address and contact information.

&amp;lt;a href="/address.do"&amp;gt;update address&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;a href="/contact.do"&amp;gt;update contact information&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...but I'm no UI designer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been toying with something for a while, I've consulted some books and &lt;a href="http://www.3dbuzz.com/xcart/product.php?productid=30&amp;amp;cat=12&amp;amp;page=1" rel="nofollow"&gt;VTMs&lt;/a&gt;, and so far this is a rough idea of a simple ui systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class uiElement()
{
    ...
    virtual void Update() = 0;
    virtual void Draw() = 0;
    ...
}

class uiButton() public : uiElement
{
    ...
    virtual void Update();
    virtual void Draw();
    ...
}

class uiTextbox() public : uiElement
{
    ...
    virtual void Update();
    virtual void Draw();
    ...
}

... // Other ui Elements

class uiWindow()
{
    ...
    void Update();
    void Draw();

    void AddElement(uiElement *Element);
    void RemoveElement(uiElement *Element);

    std::list &amp;lt;uiElement*&amp;gt; Elements;

    ...
}

void uiWindow::Update()
{
    ...
    for (list &amp;lt;uiElement*&amp;gt;::iterator it = Elements.begin(); it != Elements.end(); it++ )
        it-&amp;gt;Update();
    ...
}

void uiWindow::Draw()
{
    ...
    for (list &amp;lt;uiElement*&amp;gt;::iterator it = Elements.begin(); it != Elements.end(); it++ )
        it-&amp;gt;Draw();
    ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The princple is to create a window and attact ui Elements to it, and call the draw and update methods from the respective main functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't have anything working yet, as I have issues with drawing code. With different APIs on the PC and PSP, I'm looking at some wrapper code for OpenGL and psp gu. &lt;/p&gt;

You specify a folder using a connection string, then query a file using a SQL Select statement.  You can specify strong types using a schema.ini file.  I didn't do this at first, but then I was getting bad results where the type of the data wasn't immediately apparent, such as IP numbers or an entry like "XYQ 3.9 SP1".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One limitation I ran into is that it cannot handle column names above 64 characters; it truncates.  This shouldn't be a problem, except I was dealing with very poorly designed input data.  It returns an ADO.NET DataSet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the best solution I found.  I would be wary of rolling my own CSV parser, since I would probably miss some of the end cases, and I didn't find any other free CSV parsing packages for .NET out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT:  Also, there can only be one schema.ini file per directory, so I dynamically appended to it to strongly type the needed columns.  It will only strongly-type the columns specified, and infer for any unspecified field.  I really appreciated this, as I was dealing with importing a fluid 70+ column CSV and didn't want to specify each column, only the misbehaving ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each customer has a unique connection string stored in a master customer database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The database is designed so that everything is segmented by CustomerID, even if there is a single customer on a database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scripts are created to migrate all customer data to a new database if needed, and then only that customer's connection string needs to be updated to point to the new location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows for using a single database at first, and then easily segmenting later on once you've got a large number of clients, or more commonly when you have a couple of customers that overuse the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've found that restoring specific customer data is really tough when all the data is in the same database, but managing upgrades is much simpler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using a single database per customer, you run into a huge problem of keeping all customers running at the same schema version, and that doesn't even consider backup jobs on a whole bunch of customer-specific databases. Naturally restoring data is easier, but if you make sure not to permanently delete records (just mark with a deleted flag or move to an archive table), then you have less need for database restore in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it is time for managers to face the fact that most good developers are a bit lazy. If they weren't, we wouldn't have concepts like code reuse.&lt;br /&gt;
If this laziness can be focused into a creative force, and the developers can read up on technical issues and experiment with architecture and language features, I am certain that the end result will be better code and a more satisfied developer.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you are a manager: Let your developers slack of now and then. Encourage them to hold small seminars with the team to discuss new ways of doing stuff.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a developer: Read, learn and love your craft. You have one of the best jobs in the world, as long as you are willing to put some time into learning the best ways to do your job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simple answer to updating multiple databases when you upgrade is to do the upgrade as a transaction, and take a snapshot before upgrading if necessary. If you are running your operations well then you should be able to apply the upgrade to any number of databases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clustering is not really a solution to the problem of indices and full table scans. If you move to a cluster, very little changes. If you have have many smaller databases to distribute over multiple machines you can do this more cheaply without a cluster. Reliability and availability are considerations but can be dealt with in other ways (some people will still need a cluster but majority probably don't).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd be interested in hearing a little more context from you on this because clustering is not a simple topic and is expensive to implement in the RDBMS world. There is a lot of talk/bravado about clustering in the non-relational world Google Bigtable etc. but they are solving a different set of problems, and lose some of the useful features from an RDBMS.&lt;/p&gt;

It is definitely easier today than 2 years ago when I first tried. Make sure you have matching versions of the modules and spend some time playing with Apache locally before deploying to your server. There are versions of Apache with and without SSL. Check you have the one with OpenSSL included to protect credentials on the wire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install Apache so that it can be manually started eg. not as a service. You'll want to do this to avoid a collision with any IIS apps on your server. You can install Apache to run as a service later, once your config is right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally Apache will use Basic Authentication. You need to secure this using SSL, the credentials are not encrypted in transit. You put user details in a test file on disk. If you want to authenticate users against windows or active directory, you will have a larger task on your hands (perhaps see VisualSVN for this).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a quick look at VisuaSVN and it seems to be a good option. However a little Apache config experience can go a long way. Coming from an IIS background it wasn't too difficult, it just took some time to review all of the options/settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linq is not intended to modify existing collections or sequences. It creates new sequences based on existing ones. It is possible to achieve the above code using Linq, though it is slightly against its purposes:&lt;/p&gt;

var newArray2 = intArray.Select(i =&amp;gt; (i &amp;gt; 3) ? (i + 1) : (i));

&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; (or equivalent), as shown in some of the other answers, will exclude any values less than or equal to 3 from the resulting sequence.&lt;/p&gt;

Otherwise, you should do this through the standard Model-View-Controller architecture:  You should connect the enabled state of the controls you care about to some model-level predicate that supplies the right information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if I wanted to enable a Save button only when all required information was entered, I'd have a predicate method that tells when the model objects representing that form are in a state that can be saved.  Then in the context where I'm choosing whether to enable the button, I'd just use the result of that method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This results in a much cleaner separation of business logic from presentation logic, allowing both of them to evolve more independently  letting you create one front-end with multiple back-ends, or multiple front-ends with a single back-end with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also be much, much easier to write unit and acceptance tests for, because you can follow a "&lt;a href="http://chanson.livejournal.com/118380.html" rel="nofollow" title="Trust But Verify for UI testing"&gt;Trust But Verify&lt;/a&gt;" pattern in doing so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can write one set of tests that set up your model objects in various ways and check that the "is savable" predicate returns an appropriate result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can write a separate set of that check whether your Save button is connected in an appropriate fashion to the "is savable" predicate (whatever that is for your framework, in Cocoa on Mac OS X this would often be through a binding).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as both sets of tests are passing, you can be confident that your user interface will work the way you want it to.&lt;/p&gt;

Every time you check in, you're adding a point to which you can roll back. Even if you don't use branching/merging, this feature alone can be very valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, by having one 'authoritative' version of the source control, it becomes much easier to back up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Centralized vs. distributed... the difference is really that in distributed, there isn't necessarily one 'authoritative' version of the source control, although in practice people usually still do have the master tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big advantage to distributed source control is two-fold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you use distributed source control, you have the whole source tree on your local machine. You can commit, create branches, and work pretty much as though you were all alone, and then when you're ready to push up your changes, you can promote them from your machine to the master copy. If you're working "offline" a lot, this can be a huge benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don't have to ask anybody's permission to become a distributor of the source control. If person A is running the project, but person B and C want to make changes, and share those changes with each other, it becomes much easier with distributed source control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having some sort of revision control system in place is probably the most important tool a programmer has for reviewing code changes and understanding who did what to whom.

The trunk folder holds your current "main" line of development. For many shops and situations, this is all they ever use... just a single working repository of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tags folder takes it one step further and allows you to "checkpoint" your code at certain points in time. For example, when you release a new build or sometimes even when you simply &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; a new build, you "tag" a copy into this folder. This just allows you to know exactly what your code looked like at that point in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The branches folder holds different kinds of branches that you might need in special situations. Sometimes a branch is a place to work on experimental feature or features that might take a long time to get stable (therefore you don't want to introduce them into your main line just yet). Other times, a branch might represent the "production" copy of your code which can be edited and deployed independently from your main line of code which contains changes intended for a future release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is just one aspect of how to set up your system, but I think giving some thought to this structure is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on how large your list is, this may work. If your list is very long, you'll need to do some strange parallel array sorting, which doesn't look like much fun and is a quick way to introduce extra bugs in your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with @&lt;a href="#13475" rel="nofollow"&gt;Marius&lt;/a&gt;, even if his answer is a little terse and may come off as being flippant. Regular expressions are tough, if one's not used to using them, and the {1} in the question isn't quite error - in systems that support it, it does mean "exactly one match". In this sense, it doesn't really do anything.&lt;/p&gt;

So, the regexp given isn't really the best. I'm not a URL expert, but probably something limiting the appearance of ":"s and "//"s after the first one would be necessary (but hardly sufficient) to ensure good URLs.&lt;/p&gt;

First, there is a public website where external users can submit and update information for various purposes. This information is then saved to a local SQL Server at the colo facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second aspect is an internal application which employees use to manage those same records (conceptually) and provide status updates, approvals, etc. This application is hosted within the corporate firewall with its own local SQL Server database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two networks are connected by a hardware VPN solution, which is decent, but obviously not the speediest thing in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two databases are similar, and share many of the same tables, but they are not 100% the same. Many of the tables on both sides are very specific to either the internal or external application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the question is: when a user updates their information or submits a record on the public website, how do you transfer that data to the internal application's database so it can be managed by the internal staff? And vice versa... how do you push updates made by the staff back out to the website?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning that the more "real time" these updates occur, the better. Not that it has to be instant, just reasonably quick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I have thought about using the following types of approaches:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bi-directional replication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web service interfaces on both sides with code to sync the changes as they are made (in real time).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web service interfaces on both sides with code to asynchronously sync the changes (using a queueing mechanism).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be able to achieve near real time synchronization without the overhead or complexity of something like replication. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synchronous web services are not ideal because your code will have to be very sophisticated to handle failure scenarios. What happens when one system is restarted while the other continues to publish changes? Does the sending system get timeouts? What does it do with those? Unless you are prepared to lose data, you'll want some sort of transactional queue (like MSMQ) to receive the change notices and take care of making sure they get to the other system. If either system is down, the changes (passed as messages) will just accumulate and as soon as a connection can be established the re-starting server will process all the queued messages and catch up, making system integrity much, much easier to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some open source tools that can really make this easy for you if you are using .NET (especially if you want to use MSMQ).&lt;/p&gt;

Of course, WCF can do async messaging using MSMQ bindings, but a tool like nServiceBus or MassTransit will give you a very simple Send/Receive or Pub/Sub API that will make your requirement a very straightforward job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're using Java, there are any number of open source service bus implementations that will make this kind of bi-directional, asynchronous messaging a snap, like Mule or maybe just ActiveMQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have multiple devices that all sync with MS-Outlook.

I like to use the Outlook meeting notice or appointment reminders to remind me of an upcoming meeting or doctors appointment or whatever.  The problem lies in the fact that all the devices pop up the same reminder and I have to go to every single device individually in order to snooze or dismiss all of the identical the reminder popups.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is a sync'ing technology, why doesn't the fact that I snooze or dismiss on one device sync up the other devices automatically.  I've even tried to force a sync after dismissing a reminder and it still shows up on my other devices after a forced sync.  This is utterly annoying to me.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a setting that I'm overlooking or is there a 3rd party reminder utility that I should be using instead of the built-in stuff?&lt;/p&gt;

What do all of you think of Mozilla or someone making a server/client package that we, the users, could run on your 'main' machine? Now you just have to know your own IP or have some way to announce it to your client browsers at work or wherever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several problems I can think of with this: non static IPs, Opening up ports on your local comp etc. It just seems that Mozilla does not want to handle this traffic created by many people syncing their browsers. There is not a way for them to monetize this traffic since all the data uploaded must be encrypted.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The second pattern is aimed at the C compiler. The replacement code is a Stage I self-reproducing program that inserts both Trojan horses into the compiler. This requires a learning phase as in the Stage II example. First we compile the modified source with the normal C compiler to produce a bugged binary. We install this binary as the official C. We can now remove the bugs from the source of the compiler and the new binary will reinsert the bugs whenever it is compiled. Of course, the login command will remain bugged with no trace in source anywhere. &lt;/p&gt;

I felt that this tool didn't give me confidence and I thought that later in the project I could not manage it due to its forced established rules of development.

  &lt;p&gt;Is there a way to actually write a compiler in it's own language?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to have some existing language to write your new compiler in.  If you were writing a new, say, C++ compiler, you would just write it in C++ and compile it with an existing compiler first.  On the other hand, if you were creating a compiler for a new language, let's call it Yazzleof, you would need to write the new compiler in another language first.  Generally, this would be another programming language, but it doesn't have to be.  It can be assembly, or if necessary, machine code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; going to bootstrap a compiler for Yazzleof, you generally wouldn't write a compiler for the full language initially.  Instead you would write a compiler for Yazzle-lite, the smallest possible subset of the Yazzleof (well, a &lt;em&gt;pretty small&lt;/em&gt; subset at least).  Then in Yazzle-lite, you would write a compiler for the full language.  (Obviously this can occur iteratively instead of in one jump.)  Because Yazzle-lite is a proper subset of Yazzleof, you now have a compiler which can compile itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good writeup about bootstrapping a compiler from the lowest possible level (which on a modern machine is basically a hex editor), titled &lt;em&gt;Bootstrapping a simple compiler from nothing&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For every update in the case mentioned above we are removing one
  additional read from the table if we
  use the UPSERT instead of EXISTS.
  Unfortunately for an Insert, both the
  UPSERT and IF EXISTS methods use the
  same number of reads on the table.
  Therefore the check for existence
  should only be done when there is a
  very valid reason to justify the
  additional I/O. The optimized way to
  do things is to make sure that you
  have little reads as possible on the
  DB.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The best strategy is to attempt the
  update. If no rows are affected by the
  update then insert. In most
  circumstances, the row will already
  exist and only one I/O will be
  required.&lt;/p&gt;

Just pass the path in &lt;em&gt;filesystem representation&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;code&gt;fopen&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the path came from the stock Mac OS X frameworks (for example, an Open panel whether Carbon or Cocoa), you won't need to do any conversion on it and will be able to use it as-is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're generating part of the path yourself, you should create a CFStringRef from your path and then get that in filesystem representation to pass to POSIX APIs like &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;fopen&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, you won't have to do a lot of that for most applications.  For example, many applications may have auxiliary data files stored the user's Application Support directory, but as long as the names of those files are ASCII, and you use standard Mac OS X APIs to locate the user's Application Support directory, you don't need to do a bunch of paranoid conversion of a path constructed with those two components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edited to add:&lt;/em&gt;  I would strongly caution &lt;strong&gt;against&lt;/strong&gt; arbitrarily converting everything to UTF-8 using something like &lt;code&gt;wcstombs&lt;/code&gt; because filesystem encoding is not necessarily identical to the generated UTF-8.  Mac OS X and Windows both use specific (but different) canonical decomposition rules for the encoding used in filesystem paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, they need to decide whether "" will be stored as one or two code units (either &lt;code&gt;LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;LATIN SMALL LETTER E&lt;/code&gt; followed by &lt;code&gt;COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT&lt;/code&gt;).  These will result in two different  and different-length  byte sequences, and both Mac OS X and Windows work to avoid putting multiple files with the same name (as the user perceives them) in the same directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules for how to perform this canonical decomposition can get pretty hairy, so rather than try to implement it yourself it's best to leave it to the functions the system frameworks have provided for you to do the heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It way be better to look for a framework which has good caching support (which Code Igniter may have, I don't know), that will almost always save you more time than the few milliseconds you could shave off the request handling by using a slightly faster framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a look at the Zend Framework too, it has the benefit of being PHP 5, whereas Code Igniter is still PHP 4, as I understand it. That may be an issue when it comes to speed, but in favor of which framework I don't know. Zend has good caching support and a database profiler that can help you find where your bottlenecks are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At work we had a couple of projects written outside which we load-tested before putting them on our main boxes. We were quite surprised to find critical performance problems with both; one was written in CakePHP and the other was written using Drupal. I don't think this highlights a problem with any framework or CMS other than the need to do profiling and load-testing on any site which is going to get significant traffic. In both cases it was what the developer had done, rather than the characteristics of the software platform, that caused the problem. For example, there was a recursive function call the developer had created in the Cake project which instantiated the entire Cake object every recursion and this would have taken out the server had it gone live under load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion performance should not be a deciding factor in choosing a framework; the objective differences are likely to be marginal and the way you use it is likely to cause far more performance problems than the inherent performance of the framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that to scale any PHP application to run under load, you will need an opcode cache and you'll need to write in intelligent content caching using something like memcached or whatever built-in caching your framework supports. &lt;/p&gt;

For example, the first thing Python does when it sees source code is compile it into a bytecode representation, essentially the same as what Java does when compiling class files. This is what *.pyc files contain. Then, the python runtime executes the bytecode without referring to the original source. Traditionally, a purely interpreted language would refer to the source code continuously when executing the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When building a language, it is a good approach to build a solid foundation on which you can implement the higher level functions. If you've got a solid, fast string handling system, then the language designer can (and should) implement something like stripslashes() outside the base runtime. This is done for at least a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The language designer can show that the language is flexible enough to handle that kind of task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The language designer actually writes real code in the language, which has tests and therefore shows that the foundation is solid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other people can more easily read, borrow, and even change the higher level function without having to be able to build or even understand the language core.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because a language like Python compiles to bytecode and executes that doesn't mean it is slow. There's no reason why somebody couldn't write a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for Python, along the lines of what Java and .NET already do, to further increase the performance. In fact, IronPython compiles Python directly to .NET bytecode, which is then run using the .NET system including the JIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer your question directly, the only time a language designer would implement a function in the language behind the runtime (eg. C in the case of Python) would be to maximise the performance of that function. This is why modules such as the regular expression parser are written in C rather than native Python. On the other hand, a module like getopt.py is implemented in pure Python because it can all be done there and there's no benefit to using the corresponding C library.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I won't give away the answer, but a
  Standard Bad Solution involves the use
  of a switch or case statment (or just
  good old-fashioned cascaded-ifs). A
  Slightly Better Solution involves
  using a table of function pointers,
  and the Probably Best Solution
  involves using polymorphism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last twenty years of evolution in interpreters can be seen as going the other way - polymorphism (eg naive Smalltalk metacircular interpreters) to function pointers (naive lisp implementations, threaded code, C++) to switch (naive byte code interpreters), and then onwards to JITs and so on - which either require very big classes, or (in singly polymorphic languages) double-dispatch, which reduces the polymorphism to a type-case, and you're back at stage one. What definition of 'best' is in use here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For simple stuff a polymorphic solution is OK - &lt;a href="http://www.tincancamera.com/examples/java/expressions/ExpressionParser.java.txt" rel="nofollow"&gt;here's one I made earlier&lt;/a&gt;, but either stack and bytecode/switch or exploiting the runtime's compiler is usually better if you're, say, plotting a function with a few thousand data points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing the Dispose pattern, IDisposable, and/or a finalizer has absolutely nothing to do with when memory gets reclaimed; instead, it has everything to do with telling the GC &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to reclaim that memory. When you call Dispose() you are in no way interacting with the GC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GC will only run when it determines the need to (called memory pressure) and then (and only then) will it deallocate memory for unused objects and compact the memory space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; call GC.Collect() but you really shouldn't unless there is a &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; good reason to (which is almost always "Never"). When you force an out-of-band collection cycle like this you actually cause the GC to do more work and ultimately can end up hurting your applications performance. For the duration of the GC collection cycle your application is actually in a frozen state...the more GC cycles that run, the more time your application spends frozen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also some native Win32 API calls you can make to free your working set, but even those should be avoided unless there is a &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; good reason to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole premise behind a gargbage collected runtime is that you don't need to worry (as much) about when the runtime allocates/deallocates actual memory; you only need to worry about making sure the your object knows how to clean up after itself when asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exceptions should be used for communicating error conditions, but they shouldn't be used as control logic (especially when there are far simpler ways to determine a condition, such as Contains).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the issue is that exceptions, while not expensive to &lt;em&gt;throw&lt;/em&gt; are expensive to &lt;em&gt;catch&lt;/em&gt; and all exceptions are caught at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will need server-side script that will do it locally and output this list in your preferred format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the web-servers implement default file-browsing pages, so you could theoretically parse those but this solution will be very fragile and not very portable even between different versions of the same web-server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as expected, the interpolation are virtually identical (noise level differences, probably due to the extra characters the interpolation engine needs to handle). Straight up concatenation is about 66% of the speed, which is no great shock. The interpolation parser will look, find nothing to do, then finish with a simple internal string concat. Even if the concat were expensive, the interpolator will still have to do it, &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; all the work to parse out the variable and trim/copy up the original string.&lt;/p&gt;

Results were:

0.0014739
0.0015574
0.0011955
0.001169

&lt;p&gt;C(++):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Widely used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good preparation for the future (most programming positions require text-based programmers.)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easier to visualize program flow (blocks and wires, instead of lines of code)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easier to teach (Supposedly...)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Closer to the Robolab background that some new members may have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't need to intimately know what's going on.  Simply tell the module to find the red ball, don't need to know how.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very difficult decision for us, and we've been debating for a while.  Based on those pros for each language, and on the experience you've got, &lt;strong&gt;what do you think the better option is?&lt;/strong&gt; Keep in mind that we aren't necessarily going for pure efficiency.  We also hope to prepare our programmers for a future in programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is a graphical language easier to learn than a textual language?&lt;/strong&gt;  I think that they should be about equally challenging to learn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seeing as we are partailly rooted in helping people learn, &lt;strong&gt;how much should we rely on prewritten modules, and how much should we try to write on our own?&lt;/strong&gt;  ("Good programmers write good code, great programmers copy great code."  But isn't it worth being a good programmer, first?)&lt;/li&gt;

I'd like to emphasize this question more:
The team captain thinks that LabVIEW is better for its ease of learning and teaching.  &lt;strong&gt;Is that true?&lt;/strong&gt;  I think that C could be taught just as easily, and beginner-level tasks would still be around with C.  I'd really like to hear your opinions.  &lt;strong&gt;Is there any reason that typing while{} should be any more difficult than creating a "while box?"&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Isn't it just as intuitive that program flows line by line, only modified by ifs and loops, as it is intuitive that the program flows through the wire, only modified by ifs and loops!?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really, if you ask me, the only thing using cookie cutter things like LabVIEW to build this is going to prepare you for is to be some backyard robot builder and nothing more. If you want something that will give you something more like industry experience, build your own 'LabVIEW'-type system. Build your own find-the-ball module, or your own 'follow-the-line' module.

&lt;p&gt;As others have also said, MVC is a whole new way to build web apps - most of your presentation code won't carry across.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you are re-writing in MVC what you already have is a good prototype. Your problem is likely to be that it would be hard to do bit by bit - for instance MVC uses URL renaming out-of-the-box, making linking back and forth rather messy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another question would be why? Many of us have big sprawling legacy applications that we'd like to be in the latest technologies, but if your application is already working why switch? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I was looking at a new application right now MVC would be a very strong candidate, but there's no gain large enough to switching to it late in a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I think you're probably a little ways away from thinking about tricks &amp;amp; gotchas :) As I'm sure you're aware, ASP.NET MVC is not some new version of ASP.NET, but a totally different paradigm from ASP.NET, you won't be migrating, you'll be initiating a brand new development effort to replace an existing system. So maybe you can get a leg up on determining requirements for the app, but the rest will probably re-built from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the (very common) problems you described in your existing code base you should consider taking this opportunity to learn some of the current best practices in designing loosely coupled systems. This is easy to do because modern "best practices" are easy to understand and easy to practice, and there is enormous community support, and high quality, open source tooling to help in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are moving an ASP/ASP.NET application to ASP.NET MVC at this time as well, and this is the conclusion my preparatory research has led me to, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

The code was untidy, too complex (front and back-end) and most importantly, did not work. I am a keen programmer but had never used LabVIEW. With a little help from a LabVIEW guru who could help translate the textual progamming paradigms I knew into LabVIEW concepts it was possible to code the app in a week. The point here is that &lt;i&gt;the basic coding concepts still have to be learnt, the language, even one like LabVIEW, is just a different way of expressing them&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LabVIEW is great to use for what it was originally designed for. i.e. to take data from DAQ cards and display it on-screen perhaps with some minor manipulations in-between. However,  programming &lt;i&gt;algorithms&lt;/i&gt; is no easier and I would even suggest that it is more difficult. For example, in most procedural languages execution order is generally followed  line by line, using pseudo mathematical notation (i.e. &lt;code&gt;y = x*x + x + 1&lt;/code&gt;) whereas LabVIEW would implement this using a series of VI's which don't necessarily follow from each other (i.e. left-to-right) on the canvas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover programming as a career is more than knowing the technicalities of coding. Being able to effectively ask for help/search for answers, write readable code and work with legacy code are all key skills which are undeniably more difficult in a graphical language such as LabVIEW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe some aspects of graphical programming may become mainstream - the use of sub-VIs perfectly embodies the 'black-box' principal of programming and is also used in other language abstractions such as &lt;a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/"&gt;Yahoo Pipes&lt;/a&gt; and the Apple Automator - and perhaps some future graphical language will revolutionise the way we program but LabVIEW itself is not a massive paradigm shift in language design, we still have &lt;code&gt;while, for, if&lt;/code&gt; flow control, typecasting, event driven programming, even objects. If the future really will be written in LabVIEW, C++ programmer won't have much trouble crossing over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a postcript I'd say that C/C++ is more suited to robotics since the students will no doubt have to deal with embedded systems and FPGAs at some point. Low level programming knowledge (bits, registers etc.) would be invaluable for this kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;@mendicant&lt;/i&gt; Actually LabVIEW is used a lot in industry, especially for control systems. Granted NASA unlikely use it for on-board satellite systems but then software developement for space-systems is a &lt;a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/06/writestuff.html"&gt;whole different ball game&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Is it possible in .NET to list files on a remote location like an URL?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should specify which protocol we're talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For HTTP, lubos hasko provided the answer: no. HTTP has no concept of files; only of resources. If you have control over the web server, you can ask it to provide a directory listing, or, better yet, you can write code that lists the directory server-side for you. Without such control, you have to &lt;em&gt;rely&lt;/em&gt; on the server to provide a listing, which 1) may be disabled for security reasons, 2) is non-standardized in its format, 3) will be, like lubos said, fragile to parse (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping" rel="nofollow" title="InfoQ"&gt;"scrape"&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you mean / if the server provides a protocol intended for file transfer, such as FTP, SMB/CIFS, etc., it'll be a lot easier. For example, for FTP, you'll want to look into &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.webrequestmethods.ftp.listdirectorydetails.aspx" rel="nofollow" title="JavaLobby"&gt;WebRequestMethods.Ftp.ListDirectoryDetails&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to create a file without touching CreateFile API but can I ask &lt;strong&gt;what DLL injection method you're using&lt;/strong&gt;? If you're using something like Windows Hooks your DLL won't be installed until sometime after the target application initializes and you'll miss early calls to CreateFile. Whereas if you're using something like DetourCreateProcessWithDll your CreateFile hook can be installed prior to any of the application startup code running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience 99.9% of created/opened files result in a call to CreateFile, including files opened through C and C++ libs, third-party libs, etc. Maybe there are some undocumented DDK functions which don't route through CreateFile, but for a typical log file, I doubt it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local variables are different from struct members and arrays in the sense that you want them to fit in a register. On a 32b/64b target, a local &lt;code&gt;int16_t&lt;/code&gt; can make code slower compared to a local int since the compiler will have to add operations to /force/ overflow according to the semantics of &lt;code&gt;int16_t&lt;/code&gt;. While C99 defines an &lt;code&gt;intfast_t&lt;/code&gt; typedef, AFAIK a plain int will fit in a register just as well, and it sure is a shorter name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizations which like these typedefs almost invariably end up with several of them (&lt;code&gt;INT32, int32_t, INT32_T&lt;/code&gt;, ad infinitum). Organizations using built-in types are thus better off, in a way, having just one set of names. I wish people used the typedefs from stdint.h or windows.h or anything existing; and when a target doesn't have that .h file, how hard is it to add one?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The typedefs can theoretically aid portability, but I, for one, never gained a thing from them. Is there a useful system you can port from a 32b target to a 16b one? Is there a 16b system that isn't trivial to port to a 32b target? Moreover, if most vars are ints, you'll actually gain something from the 32 bits on the new target, but if they are &lt;code&gt;int16_t&lt;/code&gt;, you won't. And the places which are hard to port tend to require manual inspection anyway; before you try a port, you don't know where they are. Now, if someone thinks it's so easy to port things if you have typedefs all over the place - when time comes to port, which happens to few systems, write a script converting all names in the code base. This should work according to the "no manual inspection required" logic, and it postpones the effort to the point in time where it actually gives benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now if portability may be a theoretical benefit of the typedefs, &lt;i&gt;readability&lt;/i&gt; sure goes down the drain. Just look at stdint.h: &lt;code&gt;{int,uint}{max,fast,least}{8,16,32,64}_t&lt;/code&gt;. Lots of types. A program has lots of variables; is it really that easy to understand which need to be &lt;code&gt;int_fast16_t&lt;/code&gt; and which need to be &lt;code&gt;uint_least32_t&lt;/code&gt;? How many times are we silently converting between them, making them entirely pointless? (I particularly like BOOL/Bool/eBool/boolean/bool/int conversions. Every program written by an orderly organization mandating typedefs is littered with that).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course in C++ we could make the type system more strict, by wrapping numbers in template class instantiations with overloaded operators and stuff. This means that you'll now get error messages of the form "class Number&amp;lt;int,Least,32&amp;gt; has no operator+ overload for argument of type class Number&amp;lt;unsigned long long,Fast,64&amp;gt;, candidates are..." I don't call this "readability", either. Your chances of implementing these wrapper classes correctly are microscopic, and most of the time you'll wait for the innumerable template instantiations to compile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

It's a biophysics group, and we're using LabVIEW all over the place to control our instruments. That works absolutely great: it's easy to assemble a UI to control all aspects of your instruments, to view its status and to save your data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now I have to stop myself from writing a 5 page rant, because for me LabVIEW has been a nightmare. Let me instead try to summarize some pros and cons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt; I'm not a LabVIEW expert, I might say things that are biased, out-of-date or just plain wrong :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;LabVIEW pros&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, it's &lt;strong&gt;easy to learn&lt;/strong&gt;. Many PhD's in our group seem to have acquired enough skills to hack away within a few weeks, or even less.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Libraries&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a major point. You'd have to carefully investigate this for your own situation (I don't know what you need, if there are good LabVIEW libraries for it, or if there are alternatives in other languages). In my case, finding, e.g., a good, fast charting library in Python has been a major problem, that has prevented me from rewriting some of our programs in Python.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your school may already have it installed and running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;LabVIEW cons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's perhaps &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; easy to learn. In any case, it seems no one really bothers to learn best practices, so programs quickly become a complete, irreparable mess. Sure, that's also bound to happen with text-based languages if you're not careful, but IMO it's much more difficult to do things right in LabVIEW.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There tend to be &lt;strong&gt;major issues in LabVIEW with finding sub-VIs&lt;/strong&gt; (even up to version 8.2, I think). LabVIEW has its own way of knowing where to find libraries and sub-VIs, which makes it very easy to completely break your software. This makes large projects a pain if you don't have someone around who knows how to handle this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting LabVIEW to work with version control is a pain&lt;/strong&gt;. Sure, it can be done, but in any case I'd refrain from using the built-in VC. Check out &lt;a href="http://meta-diff.sourceforge.net/#lvdiff"&gt;LVDiff&lt;/a&gt; for a LabVIEW diff tool, but don't even think about merging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The last two points make working in a team on one project difficult. That's probably important in your case)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is personal, but I find that many algorithms just don't work when programmed visually. &lt;strong&gt;It's a mess&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One example is stuff that is strictly sequential; that gets cumbersome pretty quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's difficult to have an overview of the code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you use sub-VI's for small tasks (just like it's a good practice to make functions that perform a small task, and that fit on one screen), you can't just give them names, but you have to draw icons for each of them. That gets very annoying and cumbersome within only a few minutes, so you become very tempted &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to put stuff in a sub-VI. It's just too much of a hassle. Btw: making a really good icon can take a professional hours. Go try to make a unique, immediately understandable, recognizable icon for every sub-VI you write :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You'll have carpal tunnel within a week. Guaranteed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@Brendan: hear, hear!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Concluding remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for your "should I write my own modules" question: I'm not sure. Depends on your time constraints. Don't spend time on reinventing the wheel if you don't have to. It's too easy to spend days on writing low-level code and then realize you've run out of time. If that means you choose LabVIEW, go for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there'd be easy ways to combine LabVIEW and, e.g., C++, I'd love to hear about it: that may give you the best of both worlds, but I doubt there are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But make sure you and your team spend time on learning best practices. Looking at each other's code. Learning from each other. Writing usable, understandable code. And having fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And please forgive me for sounding edgy and perhaps somewhat pedantic. It's just that LabVIEW has been a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; nightmare for me :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That question couldn't be answered properly without knowing the rendering mode that the browser was in; you need to tell people what doctype you have if you have CSS rendering issues. The image behaviour you refer to is different in quirks mode as opposed to standards mode. A minimal test case must include a full HTML document and the CSS to reproduce the problem.

  &lt;p&gt;This is one of those questions where it may be good to consider what you're trying to achieve, and whether there's a better method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add some more context - 
Our company develops a C# client application, which allows users to load files and do stuff with them, kind of like how iTunes manages your MP3 files without showing you the actual file on disk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's useful to select a file in the application, and do a 'Show me this file in Windows Explorer` command - this is what I'm trying to achieve, and have done so for single files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a ListView which allows users to select multiple files within the application, and move/delete/etc them. It would be nice to have this 'show me this file in windows' command work for multiple selected files - at least if all the source files are in the same directory, but if it's not possible then it's not a major feature.&lt;/p&gt;

There are two key aspects: what browsers are your users using; and how important is it that they can access/interact with your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part is generally easily establish, &lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt; you have an existing version with stats (Google Analytics or similar is simple and great) or you have access to such data from a similar app / product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The later is a little harder to decide. If you're developing a publically availalbe, ad-sponsored site for exmple, it's just a numbers game - work out how much of your audience you lose and factor what that's worth against the additional development time. If, however you're doing something specifically at the request of a group of users - like an enterprise web app for example - you may be stuck with what those users are browsing with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience those two things can change significantly for different apps. We've got web apps still (stats from last week) with close to 70% IE6 usage (20% IE7, the rest split between IE5.5 and FF2) and others with close to 0% IE6. For relatively ovbivous reasons, the latter are the kind of apps where losing a few users isn't so important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said all that, we generally find it easy to support IE6 (and IE5.5 as others point out) simply because we've been doing so for a while. Yes, it's a pain and yes, it takes more time, but often not too much. There are very few situations where having to support IE6 drastically changes what kind development you do - it just means a little more work. The other nice benefit of supporting it (and testing for it) is that you generally end up doing better all-round browser and quirks testing as a result of the polarity of IE6's behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to decide whether or not you're supposed to find workarounds, based on the requirements of your app/product. That's it's IE6 isn't really that relevant - this kind of problem happens all the time in other situations, it just so happens that IE6 is a great example of the costs and implications of mixed standards, versioning and legacy support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When on their own, or assigning to a variable, &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; creates arrays, and &lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt; creates hashes. e.g.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a = [1,2,3] # an array
b = {1 =&amp;gt; 2} # a hash
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; can be overridden as a custom method, and is generally used to fetch things from hashes (the standard library sets up &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; as a method on hashes which is the same as &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt;) &lt;br&gt;
There is also a convention that it is used as a class method in the same way you might use a &lt;code&gt;static Create&lt;/code&gt; method in C# or Java. e.g.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a = {1 =&amp;gt; 2} # create a hash for example
puts a[1] # same as a.fetch(1), will print 2

Hash[1,2,3,4] # this is a custom class method which creates a new hash
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the Ruby &lt;a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Hash.html#method-c-5B-5D" rel="nofollow"&gt;Hash docs&lt;/a&gt; for that last example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is probably the most tricky one -
&lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt; is also syntax for blocks, but only when passed to a method OUTSIDE the arguments parens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you invoke methods without parens, Ruby looks at where you put the commas to figure out where the arguments end (where the parens would have been, had you typed them)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1.upto(2) { puts 'hello' } # it's a block
1.upto 2 { puts 'hello' } # syntax error, ruby can't figure out where the function args end
1.upto 2, { puts 'hello' } # the comma means "argument", so ruby sees it as a hash - this won't work because puts 'hello' isn't a valid hash
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

The unit tests is run very frequently while the integration tests naturally is run when the context is correctly aligned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal is to somehow be able configure which tests (or test folders) to run when I use a keyboard shortcut. The tests should preferably be run by a graphical test runner (ReSharpers). So for example&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alt+1 runs the tests in project BLL.Test, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alt+2 runs the tests in project DAL.Tests, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alt+3 runs them both (i.e. all the tests in the [Tests] folder, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alt+4 runs the tests in folder [Tests.Integration].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TestDriven.net have an option of running just the test in the selected folder or project by right-clicking it and select Run Test(s). Being able to do this, but via a keyboard command and with a graphical test runner would be awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

Declarative is usually better for anything where you really don't need the fine-grained control over how something is done.

&lt;p&gt;This wont really scale very well, and it's awkward to change - but it will give you keyboard shortcuts for running your tests. It does feel like there should be a much simpler way of doing this.&lt;/p&gt;

It will die on anything but the three characters provided (give \v a try), and enumerating every possible escape sequence every time you want to unescape a string (or keeping a global array) is a really bad solution. Analogous to PHP, that's using &lt;code&gt;preg_replace_callback()&lt;/code&gt; with a lambda instead of &lt;code&gt;preg_replace()&lt;/code&gt;, which is utterly unnecessary in this situation.&lt;/p&gt;

To me they always represented some "magic" that was going to happen on the database side, far far away from the control of my application code. I also wanted to limit the amount of work the DB had to do, as it's generally a shared resource and I always assumed triggers could get to be expensive in high load scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I have found a couple of instances where triggers have made sense to use (at least in my opinion they made sense). Recently though, I found myself in a situation where I sometimes might need to "bypass" the trigger. I felt really guilty about having to look for ways to do this, and I still think that a better database design would alleviate the need for this bypassing. Unfortunately this DB is used by mulitple applications, some of which are maintained by a very uncooperative development team who would scream about schema changes, so I was stuck.&lt;/p&gt;

A lot also depends on the complexity of the stored proc and what it does. It would be very hard to automate unit testing for a very complex procedure that modified many tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the other posters have noted some simple ways to automate manually testing them, and also some tools you can use with SQL Server. On the Oracle side, PL/SQL guru Steven Feuerstein worked on a free unit testing tool for PL/SQL stored procedures called utPLSQL. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, he dropped that effort and then went commercial with Quest's Code Tester for PL/SQL. Quest offers a free downloadable trial version. I'm on the verge of trying it out; my understanding is that it is good at taking care of the overhead in setting up a testing framework so that you can focus on just the tests themselves, and it keeps the tests so you can reuse them in regression testing, one of the great benefits of test-driven-development. In addition, it is supposed to be good at more than just checking an output variable and does have provision for validating data changes, but I still have to take a closer look myself. I thought this info might be of value for Oracle users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't do any DTS type work or anything like that, so there might be some use cases for using trigger there, but if anyone in any of my teams says that they might want to use a trigger they better have prepared their arguments well because I refuse to stand by and let triggers be added to any database I'm working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;They move logic into the database. Once you start doing that, you're asking for a world of pain because you lose your debugging, your compile time safety, your logic flow. It's all downhill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The logic they implement is not easily visible to anyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not all database engines support triggers so your solution creates dependencies on database engines&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developer modifies a shared library while working on a feature - dev has insight into possible side effects that QA / validation don't&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developer is unsure of performance of library call and writes a unit test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developer discovers path of use case not considered in spec that code must support, writes code, updates spec, writes test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's arguable how much test duty should be carried out by the dev in the third example, but I argue that it's most efficient for the dev because all of the related minutiae from many layers of documentation and code are already in her short-term memory. This perfect storm may not be attainable by a tester after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we talking about QA or validation? I think of QA along the lines of inspection checklists, code standards enforcement, UI guidelines, etc. If we're talking validation, it doesn't make sense for devs to spend a lot of time authoring and executing formal test cases, but devs must provide all of the rationale and design documentation needed to author good tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better than that though would be to have a deterministic point where whatever owns the object that's doing the observing could tell it it's done and will (eventually) be deallocated.  That way, you can stop observing immediately when the thing doing the observing is no longer needed, regardless of when it's actually deallocated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is important to keep in mind because the lifetime of objects in Cocoa isn't as deterministic as some people seem to think it is.  The various Mac OS X frameworks themselves &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; send your objects &lt;code&gt;-retain&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-autorelease&lt;/code&gt;, extending their lifetime beyond what you might otherwise think it would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, when you make the transition to Objective-C garbage collection, you'll find that &lt;code&gt;-finalize&lt;/code&gt; will run at very different times  and in very different contexts  than &lt;code&gt;-dealloc&lt;/code&gt; did.  For one thing, finalization takes place on a different thread, so you really &lt;strong&gt;can't&lt;/strong&gt; safely send &lt;code&gt;-removeObserver:forKeyPath:&lt;/code&gt; to another object in a &lt;code&gt;-finalize&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stick to memory (and other scarce resource) management in &lt;code&gt;-dealloc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-finalize&lt;/code&gt;, and use a separate &lt;code&gt;-invalidate&lt;/code&gt; method to have an owner tell an object you're done with it at a deterministic point; do things like removing KVO observations there.  The intent of your code will be clearer and you will have fewer subtle bugs to take care of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Databases expose themselves via tables, and keeping tables and rows consistent can be done with triggers.  Another way to keep them consistent is to disallow direct access to the tables, and only allowing it through stored procedures and views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside of triggers is that any action can invoke them; this is also a strength - no-one is going to screw up the integrity of the system through incompetence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a counterpoint, allowing access to a database only through stored procedures and views still allows the backdoor access of permissions.  Users with sufficient permissions are trusted not to break database integrity, all others use stored procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to reducing the amount of work: databases are stunningly efficient when they don't have to deal with the outside world; you'd be really surprised how much even process switching hurts performance.  That's another upside of stored procedures: rather than a dozen calls to the database (and all the associated round trips), there's one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Bunching stuff up in a single stored proc is fine, but what happens when something goes wrong? Say you have 5 steps and the first step fails, what happens to the other steps? You need to add a whole bunch of logic in there to cater for that situation. Once you start doing that you lose the benefits of the stored procedure in that scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business logic has to go somewhere, and there's a lot of implied domain rules embedded in the design of a database - relations, constraints and so on are an attempt to codify business rules by saying, for example, a user can only have one password.  Given you've started shoving business rules onto the database server by having these relations and so on, where do you draw the line?  When does the database give up responsibility for the integrity of the data, and start trusting the calling apps and database users to get it right?  Stored procedures with these rules embedded in them can push a lot of political power into the hands of the DBAs.  It comes down to how many tiers are going to exist in your n-tier architecture; if there's a presentation, business and data layer, where does the separation between business and data lie?  What value-add does the business layer add?  Will you run the business layer on the database server as stored procedures?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I think that having to bypass a trigger means that you're "doing it wrong"; in this case a trigger isn't for you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As to reducing the amount of work: databases are stunningly efficient when they don't have to deal with the outside world; you'd be really surprised how much even process switching hurts performance. That's another upside of stored procedures: rather than a dozen calls to the database (and all the associated round trips), there's one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this is a little off topic, but you should also be aware that you're only looking at this from one potential positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bunching stuff up in a single stored proc is fine, but what happens when something goes wrong? Say you have 5 steps and the first step fails, what happens to the other steps? You need to add a whole bunch of logic in there to cater for that situation. Once you start doing that you lose the benefits of the stored procedure in that scenario. &lt;/p&gt;

"Black box" testing is what most people think of when you mention Quality Assurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work for a company where the QA team are also software developers.  (That narrows the field &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; if you care to guess the company.)  I know Joel's opinion, and my experience leads me to partially disagree: for the same reason that a "white hat" hacker is more effective finding security holes, certain kinds of errors are more effectively found by white box testers who know how to write code (and therefore what the common mistakes are - for example, resource management issues like memory leaks).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, since QA-oriented developers are part of the process from the initial design phase, they can theoretically help to drive higher-quality code throughout the process.  Ideally, for each developer working on the project with a mental focus on functionality, you have an opposing developer with a mental focus on breaking the code (and thus making it better).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seen in that light, it's less a matter of using developers for testers than it is kind of disconnected pair-programming where one developer has an emphasis on controlling quality.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a lot of testing (such as basic UI functionality) frankly doesn't need that kind of skill.  That's where Joel has a point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many businesses, I could see a system where programming teams trade off code review and testing duties for each others' code.  Members of the Business Logic team, for example, could spend an occasional tour testing and reviewing code for the UI team, and vice-versa.  That way you're not "wasting" developer talent on full-time testing, but you are gaining the advantages of exposing the code to (hopefully) expert scrutiny and punishment.  Then, a more traditional QA team can take up the "black box" testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would you go adding automated testing to a game?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe you can unit test a lot of the game engine's functionality (networking, object creation, memory management, etc), but is it possible to automate test the actual game itself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not talking about gameplay elements (like Protoss would beat Zerg in map X), but I'm talking about the interaction between the game and the engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In game development, the engine is just a platform for the game. You could think of the game engine as an OS and the game as a software the OS would run. The game could be a collection of scripts or an actual subroutine inside the game engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Possible Answers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My idea is this: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would need an engine that is deterministic. This means that given one set of input, the output would be exactly the same. This would inlude the random generator being seeded with the same input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, create a bare-bone level which contains a couple of objects the avatar/user can interact with. Start small and then add objects into the level as more interactions are developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a script which follows a path (tests pathfinding) and interact with the different objects (store the result or expected behavior). This script would be your automated test. After a certain amount of time (say, one week), run the script along with your engine's unit tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally call this the Paranoid Programming but Wikipedia is never wrong (&lt;em&gt;sarcasm&lt;/em&gt;). Basically, you add tests to your functions that checks all the inputs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is the user's cookies valid?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is he still currently logged in?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are the function's parameters protected against SQL injection? (even though you know that the input are generated by your own functions, you will test anyway)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Log everything like crazy. Its easier to remove logs then to add them. A user have logged in? Log it. A user found a 404? Log it. The admin edited/deleted a post? Log it. Someone was able to access a restricted page? Log it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't be surprised if your log file reaches 15+ Mb during your development phase. During beta, you can decide which logs to remove. If you want, you can add a flag to decide when a certain event is logged.&lt;/p&gt;

After that you look at the quality that the developer generates.  Do they write unit tests and believe in testing and being responsible for the code they generate?  Do they take initiative to fix bugs without being assigned them?  Are they passionate about coding?  Are they always constantly learning, trying to find better ways to accomplish a task or make a process better?  These questions are pretty much how I judge developers directly under me.  If they are not directly under you and you are not a direct report for them, then you really shouldn't be evaluating them.  If you are assigned in evaluating those programmers that aren't under you, then you need to be proactive to answer the above questions about them, which can be hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can't remove the evaluation test.  I know it can become tedious sometimes, but I actually enjoy doing it and it's invaluable for the developer you are evaluating.  You need to be a manager that cares about how your developers do.  You are a direct reflection on them and as they are of you.  One question I always leave up to the developer is for them to evaluate me.  The evaluation needs to be a two lane road.&lt;/p&gt;

If there is an &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; memory &lt;em&gt;leak&lt;/em&gt; here, then that is a bug in the .NET Framework, and not something you can necessarily fix in your code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I think you (and the poster on your blog) are actually talking about here is not actually a leak, but rather an ongoing consumption of memory. That's not the same thing. To be clear, leaked memory is memory that is reserved by a program, then abandoned (ie, a pointer is left dangling), and which subsequently cannot be freed. Since memory is managed in .NET, this is theoretically impossible. It is possible, however, for a program to reserve an ever-increasing amount of memory without allowing references to it to go out of scope (and become eligible for garbage collection); however that memory is not leaked. The GC will return it to the system once your program exits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So. To answer your question, I don't think you actually have a problem here. You certainly don't have a memory leak, and from your code, I don't think you need to worry, as far as memory consumption goes either. As long as you make sure that you are not repeatedly assigning that event handler without ever de-assigning it (ie, that you either only ever set it once, or that you remove it exactly once for each time that you assign it), which you seem to be doing, your code should be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like that's the advice that the poster on your blog was trying to give you, but he used that alarming work "leak," which is a scary word, but which many programmers have forgotten the real meaning of in the managed world; it doesn't apply here.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Values are so random within the gameplay aspects of development that it would be a far fetched idea to test for absolute values&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we can test deterministic values. For example, a unit test might have Guybrush Threepwood move toward a door (pathfinding), open the door (use command), fail because he doesn't have a key in his inventory (feedback), pick the door key (pathfinding + inventory management) and then finally opening the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these paths are deterministic. With this unit test, I can refactor the memory manager and if it somehow broke the inventory management routine, the unit test would fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just one idea for unit testing in games. I would love to know other ideas, hence, the motivation for this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When serving as text/html, all you need a doctype for is to trigger standards mode. Beyond that, the doctype does nothing as far as browsers are concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When serving as text/html, whether you use XHTML markup or HTML markup, it's treated by browsers as HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, really it comes down to using the shortest doctype that triggers standards mode (&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;) and using HTML markup that produces the correct result in browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest is about conforming, validation and markup prerference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, using &amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt; now and trying to make your markup conform to HTML5 is not a bad idea as long as you stick to stable features that work in browsers now. You wouldn't use anything in HTML4 or XHTML 1.x that doesn't work in browsers, would you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, you use &amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt; with HTML4-like markup while honoring things that have been clarified in HTML5. HTML5 is about browser compatibility after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside to using HTML5 now is that the spec can change quite often. This makes it important for you to keep up with the spec as it actively changes. Also &lt;a href="http://validator.nu/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://validator.nu/&lt;/a&gt; might not always be up-to-date, but &lt;a href="http://validator.w3.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://validator.w3.org/&lt;/a&gt; isn't always up-to-date either, so don't let that stop you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you want to use XHTML 1.0 markup and conform to XHTML 1.0, then you shouldn't use &amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I always use &amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt; for HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;After you install ViM on Windows, if you right-click on any file in Explorer, you see the &lt;strong&gt;Edit with Vim&lt;/strong&gt; option in the right-click menu. This is very useful for peeking into and editing &lt;em&gt;every kind of text file&lt;/em&gt; without having to bother about specific editors. GViM can understand most formats and thus displays them with syntax coloring. Get used to doing this and soon GViM becomes your defacto generic text editor on Windows.

Use a multi-dimensional table. Each variable serves as an index to the table,
and the if statement turns into a table lookup. For example if (size == 3 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; weight &gt; 70)
translates into the table entry decision[size][weight_group]&lt;/p&gt;

I've gathered that you can't have it both ways -- that is to say, have the class functionality in a separate ActionScript class file but have the contained elements declared in mxml.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There doesn't seem to be much of a difference productivity-wise, but doing data binding programmatically seems somewhat less than trivial. I took a look at how the mxml compiler transforms the data binding expressions. The result is a bunch of generated callbacks and a lot more lines than in the mxml representation.

&lt;p&gt;'==================================================================&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acceptance / Customer tests&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;=&lt;/em&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Property testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine that to be a square with four quadrants. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The left half should be automated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developer tests verify that the code works as the coder wanted it to.
  Tools: NUnit / xUnit / whatever home-made tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer tests verify that the code works as the customer wanted it to.
The tests should be very easy to write, shouldn't require the customer to learn .NET/Java. Else the customer wont write those tests (although he may require some help of a developer). Fit for example uses HTML tables that can be written in Word.
Tools: FIT
Regression tools also lie here. Record-replay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right half better utilizes the time &amp;amp; effort of good testers. e.g. No automated test can tell you whether X dialog is usable. Humans are better at this than machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usability. Try to Break the System down,( catch unhandled failure scenarios, enter null values ). Basically catch things that the developer missed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Property testing again requires humans. Here you check customer mandated properties that are required by your system. e.g. Performance - does your search dialog meet the 2 sec response time ? Security- can someone hack into this System ? etc. Availability - is your system online 99.99% of the time ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testers shouldn't be spending time executing test-plans on the left half. That is the developers responsibility to ensure that the code works as the customer and the developer intended it to. The testers can infact help the customer formulate the acceptance tests..&lt;/p&gt;

If you write your own &lt;em&gt;reusable&lt;/em&gt; components then writing them in ActionScript may sometimes give you a little more control, but for non-reusable views MXML is much better. It's more terse, bindings are extemely easy to set up, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, bindings in pure ActionScript need not be that much of a pain. It will never be as simple as in MXML where a lot of things are done for you, but it can be done with not too much effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you have is &lt;code&gt;BindingUtils&lt;/code&gt; and it's methods &lt;code&gt;bindSetter&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;bindProperty&lt;/code&gt;. I almost always use the former, since I usually want to do some work, or call &lt;code&gt;invalidateProperties&lt;/code&gt; when values change, I almost never just want to set a property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you need to know is that these two return an object of the type &lt;code&gt;ChangeWatcher&lt;/code&gt;, if you want to remove the binding for some reason, you have to hold on to this object. This is what makes manual bindings in ActionScript a little less convenient than those in MXML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start with a simple example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;BindingUtils.bindSetter(nameChanged, selectedEmployee, "name");
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sets up a binding that will call the method &lt;code&gt;nameChanged&lt;/code&gt; when the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; property on the object in the variable &lt;code&gt;selectedEmployee&lt;/code&gt; changes. The &lt;code&gt;nameChanged&lt;/code&gt; method will recieve the new value of the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; property as an argument, so it should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;private function nameChanged( newName : String ) : void
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with this simple example is that once you have set up this binding it will fire each time the property of the specified object changes. The value of the variable &lt;code&gt;selectedEmployee&lt;/code&gt; may change, but the binding is still set up for the object that the variable pointed to before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to solve this: either to keep the &lt;code&gt;ChangeWatcher&lt;/code&gt; returned by &lt;code&gt;BindingUtils.bindSetter&lt;/code&gt; around and call &lt;code&gt;unwatch&lt;/code&gt; on it when you want to remove the binding (and then setting up a new binding instead), or bind to yourself. I'll show you the first option first, and then explain what I mean by binding to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;currentEmployee&lt;/code&gt; could be made into a getter/setter pair and implemented like this (only showing the setter):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public function set currentEmployee( employee : Employee ) : void {
    if ( _currentEmployee != employee ) {
        if ( _currentEmployee != null ) {
            currentEmployeeNameCW.unwatch();
        }

        _currentEmployee = employee;

        if ( _currentEmployee != null ) {
            currentEmployeeNameCW = BindingUtils.bindSetter(currentEmployeeNameChanged, _currentEmployee, "name");
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens is that when the &lt;code&gt;currentEmployee&lt;/code&gt; property is set it looks to see if there was a previous value, and if so removes the binding for that object (&lt;code&gt;currentEmployeeNameCW.unwatch()&lt;/code&gt;), then it sets the private variable, and unless the new value was &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; sets up a new binding for the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; property. Most importantly it saves the &lt;code&gt;ChangeWatcher&lt;/code&gt; returned by the binding call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a basic binding pattern and I think it works fine. There is, however, a trick that can be used to make it a bit simpler. You can bind to yourself instead. Instead of setting up and removing bindings each time the &lt;code&gt;currentEmployee&lt;/code&gt; property changes you can have the binding system do it for you. In your &lt;code&gt;creationComplete&lt;/code&gt; handler (or constructor or at least some time early) you can set up a binding like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;BindingUtils.bindSetter(currentEmployeeNameChanged, this, ["currentEmployee", "name"]);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sets up a binding not only to the &lt;code&gt;currentEmployee&lt;/code&gt; property on &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt;, but also to the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; property on this object. So anytime either changes the method &lt;code&gt;currentEmployeeNameChanged&lt;/code&gt; will be called. There's no need to save the &lt;code&gt;ChangeWatcher&lt;/code&gt; because the binding will never have to be removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second solution works in many cases, but I've found that the first one is sometimes necessary, especially when working with bindings in non-view classes (since &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; has to be an event dispatcher and the &lt;code&gt;currentEmployee&lt;/code&gt; has to be bindable for it to work).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If you don't have Visual C++ Express Edition (VCEE), download and install &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/default.aspx" rel="nofollow" title="Dylan: A Dynamic Object-Oriented Language"&gt;VCEE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The default install of Visual C++ Express Edition builds for the .Net platform. We'll need to build for the Windows platform since OpenGL and GLUT are not yet fully supported under .Net. For this we need the Microsoft Platform SDK. (If you're using an older version of VCEE, download and install the &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=A55B6B43-E24F-4EA3-A93E-40C0EC4F68E5" rel="nofollow"&gt;Microsoft Platform SDK&lt;/a&gt;. Visual C++ Express Edition will need to be configured to build for Windows platform. All these instructions are available &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235626(VS.80).aspx" rel="nofollow" title="Dylan Reference Manual"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don't have GLUT, download and unzip Nate Robin's &lt;a href="http://www.xmission.com/~nate/glut.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Windows port of GLUT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;strong&gt;glut.h&lt;/strong&gt; to your &lt;em&gt;Platform SDK/include/GL/&lt;/em&gt; directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Link the project with &lt;strong&gt;glut.lib&lt;/strong&gt;. (Go to VCEE &lt;em&gt;Project Properties -&gt; Additional Linker Directories&lt;/em&gt; and add the directory which has &lt;strong&gt;glut.lib&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;strong&gt;glut.dll&lt;/strong&gt; to the &lt;em&gt;Windows/System32&lt;/em&gt; directory, so that all programs using GLUT
can find it at runtime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your program which uses GLUT or OpenGL should compile under Visual C++ Express Edition now.&lt;/p&gt;

As you suggest your random number generator must be seeded with the same value, and must produce an identical sequence each time.
The game ran on 50hz cycles, so timing was not an issue. I had a system that would record mouse clicks and locations, and used this to manually generate a 'script' which could be replayed to produce the same results. By removing the timing delays and turning off the graphic generation an hour of gameplay could be replicated in a few seconds.
The biggest problem was that changes to the game design would invalidate the script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your barebones room contained logic that was independent of the general game play then it could work very well. The engine could start up without any ui and start the script as soon as initialisation is complete. Testing for crashing along the way would be simple, but more complex tests such as leaving the characters in the correct positions would be more complex. If the recording of the scripts are simple enough, which they were in my system, then they can be updated very easily, and special scripts to test specialised behavior can be set up very quickly. My system had the added advantage that it could be used during game testing, and the exact sequence of events recorded to make bug fixing easier.&lt;/p&gt;

Be careful with this - you should favor composition over inheritance. Inheritance should only be used for polymorphism, when it makes sense from a modelling point of view. It is not a good tool for code reuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the question: Be ware of the limitations when doing this - for example in the code shown, using an extension method to implement GetChildren effectively 'seals' this implementation and doesn't allow any IHaveChildren impl to provide its own if needed. If this is OK, then I dont mind the extension method approach that much. It is not set in stone, and can usually be easily refactored when more flexibility is needed later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For greater flexibility, using the strategy pattern may be preferable. Something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public interface IHaveChildren 
{
    string ParentType { get; }
    int ParentId { get; }
}

public interface IChildIterator
{
    IEnumerable&amp;lt;IChild&amp;gt; GetChildren();
}

public void DefaultChildIterator : IChildIterator

    public DefaultChildIterator(IHaveChildren parent)

&lt;p&gt;Actually once I'd accommodated for escaped characters my regex ran slightly slower than my hand written top down recursive parser and that's without the nesting (linking sub-items to their parents) and error reporting the hand written parser had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regex was a slightly faster to write (though I do have a bit of experience with hand parsers) but that's without good error reporting. Once you add that it becomes slightly harder and longer to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also find the hand written parser easier to understand the intention of. For instance, here is the a snippet of the code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;private static Node ParseNode(TextReader reader)
{
    Node node = new Node();
    int indentation = ParseWhitespace(reader);
    Expect(reader, '[');
    node.Key = ParseTerminatedString(reader, ':');
    node.Value = ParseTerminatedString(reader, ']');
}

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;GL_FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_DUPLICATE_ATTACHMENT_EXT&lt;/strong&gt; definition for FBO used to be present in the specification (and hence in header files). But, it was later removed.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(87) What happens if a single image is attached more than once to a
     framebuffer object?

     RESOLVED: The value written to the pixel is undefined.

     There used to be a rule in section 4.4.4.2 that resulted in
     FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_DUPLICATE_ATTACHMENT_EXT if a single
     image was attached more than once to a framebuffer object.

         FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_DUPLICATE_ATTACHMENT_EXT   0x8CD8

         * A single image is not attached more than once to the
           framebuffer object.

           { FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_DUPLICATE_ATTACHMENT_EXT }

     This rule was removed in version #117 of the
     EXT_framebuffer_object specification after discussion at the
     September 2005 ARB meeting.  The rule essentially required an
     O(n*lg(n)) search.  Some implementations would not need to do that
     search if the completeness rules did not require it.  Instead,
     language was added to section 4.10 which says the values
     written to the framebuffer are undefined when this rule is
     violated.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix this error, remove all usage of &lt;strong&gt;GL_FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_DUPLICATE_ATTACHMENT_EXT&lt;/strong&gt; from your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this isn't possible in your setup, then add a dummy definition to your &lt;strong&gt;glext.h&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;glew.h&lt;/strong&gt; file like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#define GL_FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_DUPLICATE_ATTACHMENT_EXT 0x8CD8

Some of the things described there are specific to Subversion, but many of the concepts are "universal" for version control systems and how to work with them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it's very important that people make an effort in trying to understand the main concepts and rationales behind version control systems before starting to use them. All too often I see developers only using a small subset of their system's features because they don't understand the underlying concepts and therefore either don't see the point in using what they consider "advanced" or "unnecessary" features, or they are simply afraid to do so in fear of breaking something or causing problems for the project.&lt;/p&gt;

It doesn't necessarily need all the bells and whistles of a full version control system, but something that that removes the need for incremental naming (Notes_1.23.doc) and lessens the chance of overwriting something by mistake. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also needs to be multiplatform, handle large files (100 mb+) and be usable by somewhat non technical people. &lt;/p&gt;

However, they're perfect for text that needs to be overlayed on the display window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the sample steps to display Eric Cartman's favorite quote colored in green on a GLUT window:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);
glPushMatrix();
glLoadIdentity();
gluOrtho2D(0.0, WIN_WIDTH, 0.0, WIN_HEIGHT);

glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
glPushMatrix();
glLoadIdentity();

&lt;p&gt;Set the font color. (Set this now, not later.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;glColor3f(0.0, 1.0, 0.0); // Green
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set the window location where the text should be displayed. This is done by setting the raster position in screen coordinates. Lower left corner of the window is (0, 0).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;glRasterPos2i(10, 10);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set the font and display the string characters using &lt;strong&gt;glutBitmapCharacter&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;string s = "Respect mah authoritah!";
void * font = GLUT_BITMAP_9_BY_15;
for (string::iterator i = s.begin(); i != s.end(); ++i)
{
    char c = *i;
    glutBitmapCharacter(font, c);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restore back the matrices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
glPopMatrix();

glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);
glPopMatrix();

&lt;p&gt;Some WPF layout objects can clog up your memory and make your application really slow when they are not garbadge collected. So I find the choice of words to be correct, you are leaking memory to objects you no longer use. You expect the items to be garbadge collected, but they aren't, because there is a reference somewhere (in this case in the from an event handler).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for a real answer :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I advise you to read this &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb613565.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;WPF Performance article on MSDN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Not Removing Event Handlers on Objects
  may Keep Objects Alive&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The delegate that an object passes to
  its event is effectively a reference
  to that object. Therefore, event
  handlers can keep objects alive longer
  than expected. When performing clean
  up of an object that has registered to
  listen to an object's event, it is
  essential to remove that delegate
  before releasing the object. Keeping
  unneeded objects alive increases the
  application's memory usage. This is
  especially true when the object is the
  root of a logical tree or a visual
  tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They advise you to look into the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa970850.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;Weak Event pattern&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another solution would be to remove the event handlers when you are done with an object. But I know that with Attached Properties that point might not always be clear..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I think it's better to join in an established project than to start your own. Your contributions will be used by more people, and from the point of view of an employer I'd much rather hear that you contributed to a project I might have heard of instead of "I started yet another .NET weblog project".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the surface you might think so, but the fact is, open-source projects are far more common than independent pet projects, and the other fact is, open-source projects are missing two key ingredient employers want to see: &lt;strong&gt;experience developing software for a paying customer base&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;experience with the full software development life cycle&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, in many jobs, too much of an "open-source" emphasis can hurt you, rather than help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-source is still associated, in many manager's minds, with academia and the academic (rather than the commercial) view on programming. Fairly or unfairly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it's definitely, always and forever, a good idea to get involved with open-source, for learning, for community, and for a dozen other reasons. But if you're specifically trying to bridge the gap from being a "hobbyist" programmer to a "professional" one, I think the easiest way, the way that gives you the most "bang" for your programming "buck", is to build and promote something from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That demonstrates full software life cycle development, and it demonstrates initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it's likely you'll learn far more about actually programming doing things in this way, rather than developing a left-handed spin widget UI component for the latest hip open-source project ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;$ gcc ogl.c -lglut32 -lglu32 -lopengl32&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;How much do you stand to lose if the end user loads an unauthorised plugin?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly this won't happen often, but when/if it does happen we lose a lot and I although I understand we will produce nothing 100% secure, I want to make it enough of a hindrance to put people off doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The annoying thing about going with a simple dynamic loading with full strong name, is that all it takes is a simple string literal change within the loader app to load any other assembly even though the plugins are signed. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In this version, the .NET runtime
  added support for what we call the
  DataDirectory macro. This allows
  Visual Studio to put a special
  variable in the connection string that
  will be expanded at run-time...&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;By default, the |DataDirectory|
  variable will be expanded as follow:&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For applications placed in a
  directory on the user machine, this
  will be the app's (.exe) folder.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For apps running under ClickOnce, this will be a special data folder
  created by ClickOnce&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For Web apps, this will be the App_Data folder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Under the hood, the value for
  |DataDirectory| simply comes from a
  property on the app domain. It is
  possible to change that value and
  override the default behavior by doing
  this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;AppDomain.CurrentDomain.SetData("DataDirectory", newpath)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the scroll wheel in FreeGLUT is dead simple. Here is how:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Declare a callback function that shall be called whenever the scroll wheel is scrolled. This is the prototype:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void mouseWheel(int, int, int, int);

&lt;p&gt;Register the callback with the (Free)GLUT function &lt;strong&gt;glutMouseWheelFunc()&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;glutMouseWheelFunc(mouseWheel);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Define the callback function. The second parameter gives the direction of the scroll. Values of +1 is forward, -1 is backward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void mouseWheel(int button, int dir, int x, int y)
{
    if (dir &amp;gt; 0)

&lt;p&gt;However, as we're moving down the road of OSGi and a modular project, we've ended up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;./trunk/bundle/main&lt;br /&gt;
./trunk/bundle/modulea&lt;br /&gt;
./trunk/bundle/moduleb
./tags/bundle/main-1.0.0&lt;br /&gt;
./tags/bundle/main-1.0.1&lt;br /&gt;
./tags/bundle/modulea-1.0.0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 'build' is still quite monolithic in that it builds all modules in sequence, though I'm starting to wonder if we should refactor the build/repository to something more like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;./bundle/main/trunk&lt;br /&gt;
./bundle/main/tags/main-1.0.0&lt;br /&gt;
./bundle/main/tags/main-1.0.1&lt;br /&gt;
./bundle/modulea/trunk&lt;br /&gt;
./bundle/modulea/tags/modulea-1.0.0  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this pattern I would imagine each module building itself, and storing its binary in a repository (maven, ivy, or another path of the subversion repository itself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there guidelines or 'best-practices' over project layouts once one goes modular?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;stdlib.h&lt;/strong&gt; which ships with the recent versions of Visual Studio has a different (and conflicting) definition of the &lt;strong&gt;exit()&lt;/strong&gt; function. It clashes with the definition in &lt;strong&gt;glut.h&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Override the definition in glut.h with that in stdlib.h. Place the stdlib.h line above the glut.h line in your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt;

A SWF file gives permission to SWF files from other domains by calling Security.allowDomain(). By calling Security.allowDomain("siteA.com"), swfB.swf gives SWF files from siteA.com permission to script it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. Subversion also keeps track of changes to the directory structure, and all version history is preserved even if a file is moved in the tree. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend converting the repository with &lt;a href="http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;cvs2svn&lt;/a&gt;, including branches and tags. Once the repository is in Subversion you can move the branches and tags around as you wish. This also keeps the history of the actual tags and branches being renamed, which may be interesting in a historical context later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hard solution&lt;/strong&gt;:
If you have a &lt;strong&gt;really strong reason&lt;/strong&gt; not to use GLEW, here's how to achieve the same without it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identify the OpenGL extension and the extension APIs you wish to use. OpenGL extensions are listed in the &lt;a href="http://www.opengl.org/registry/" rel="nofollow"&gt;OpenGL Extension Registry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Example: I wish to use the capabilities of the &lt;a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/EXT/framebuffer_object.txt" rel="nofollow"&gt;EXT_framebuffer_object&lt;/a&gt; extension. The APIs I wish to use from this extension are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;glGenFramebuffersEXT()
glBindFramebufferEXT()
glFramebufferTexture2DEXT()
glCheckFramebufferStatusEXT()
glDeleteFramebuffersEXT()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check if your graphic card supports the extension you wish to use. If it does, then your work is almost done! Download and install the latest drivers and SDKs for your graphics card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Example: The graphics card in my PC is a &lt;strong&gt;NVIDIA 6600 GT&lt;/strong&gt;. So, I visit the &lt;a href="http://developer.nvidia.com/object/nvidia_opengl_specs.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;NVIDIA OpenGL Extension Specifications&lt;/a&gt; webpage and find that the &lt;a href="http://www.nvidia.com/dev_content/nvopenglspecs/GL_EXT_framebuffer_object.txt" rel="nofollow"&gt;EXT_framebuffer_object&lt;/a&gt; extension is supported. I then download the latest &lt;a href="http://developer.nvidia.com/object/sdk_home.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;NVIDIA OpenGL SDK&lt;/a&gt; and install it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your graphic card manufacturer provides a &lt;strong&gt;glext.h&lt;/strong&gt; header file (or a similarly named header file) with all the declarations needed to use the supported OpenGL extensions. (Note that not all extensions might be supported.) Either place this header file somewhere your compiler can pick it up or include its directory in your compiler's include directories list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add a &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;glext.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; line in your code to include the header file into your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/ABI/glext.h" rel="nofollow"&gt;glext.h&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, find the API you wish to use and grab its corresponding &lt;em&gt;ugly-looking&lt;/em&gt; declaration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Example: I search for the above framebuffer APIs and find their corresponding ugly-looking declarations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;typedef void (APIENTRYP PFNGLGENFRAMEBUFFERSEXTPROC) (GLsizei n, GLuint *framebuffers); for GLAPI void APIENTRY glGenFramebuffersEXT (GLsizei, GLuint *);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this means is that your header file has the API declaration in 2 forms. One is a wgl-like ugly function pointer declaration. The other is a sane looking function declaration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each extension API you wish to use, add in your code declarations of the function name as a type of the ugly-looking string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;PFNGLGENFRAMEBUFFERSEXTPROC glGenFramebuffersEXT;
PFNGLBINDFRAMEBUFFEREXTPROC glBindFramebufferEXT;
PFNGLFRAMEBUFFERTEXTURE2DEXTPROC glFramebufferTexture2DEXT;
PFNGLCHECKFRAMEBUFFERSTATUSEXTPROC glCheckFramebufferStatusEXT;
PFNGLDELETEFRAMEBUFFERSEXTPROC glDeleteFramebuffersEXT;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it looks ugly, all we're doing is to declare function pointers of the type corresponding to the extension API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initialize these function pointers with their rightful functions. These functions are exposed by the library or driver. We need to use &lt;strong&gt;wglGetProcAddress()&lt;/strong&gt; function to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;glGenFramebuffersEXT = (PFNGLGENFRAMEBUFFERSEXTPROC) wglGetProcAddress("glGenFramebuffersEXT");
glBindFramebufferEXT = (PFNGLBINDFRAMEBUFFEREXTPROC) wglGetProcAddress("glBindFramebufferEXT");
glFramebufferTexture2DEXT = (PFNGLFRAMEBUFFERTEXTURE2DEXTPROC) wglGetProcAddress("glFramebufferTexture2DEXT");
glCheckFramebufferStatusEXT = (PFNGLCHECKFRAMEBUFFERSTATUSEXTPROC) wglGetProcAddress("glCheckFramebufferStatusEXT");
glDeleteFramebuffersEXT = (PFNGLDELETEFRAMEBUFFERSEXTPROC) wglGetProcAddress("glDeleteFramebuffersEXT");
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't forget to check the function pointers for &lt;em&gt;NULL&lt;/em&gt;. If by chance &lt;strong&gt;wglGetProcAddress()&lt;/strong&gt; couldn't find the extension function, it would've initialized the pointer with NULL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (NULL == glGenFramebuffersEXT || NULL == glBindFramebufferEXT || NULL == glFramebufferTexture2DEXT
    || NULL == glCheckFramebufferStatusEXT || NULL == glDeleteFramebuffersEXT)
{
    // Extension functions not loaded!
    exit(1);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it, we're done! You can now use these function pointers just as if the function calls existed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

trunk

&lt;p&gt;I have also often used the structure in large repositories containing many projects, because keeping all projects in the same repository makes cross-referencing projects and sharing code between them&amp;mdash;with history&amp;mdash;easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to use the structure with root trunk, tags and branches folders from the start because in my experience (with large repositories containing many projects), many sub-projects and modules will never have separate tags or branches, so there is no need to create the folder structure for them. It also makes it easier for the developers to check out the entire trunk of the repository and not get all the tags and branches (which they don't need most of the time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess this is a matter of project or company policy though. If you have one repository for each project or a given developer is only likely to work on a single project in the repository at a time the rooted trunk may not make as much sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VCS don't really handle images and such very well - would it be possible to have the code in a VCS (SVN/Git/Mercurial etc), along-side a sensible folder structure for the binary-assets (source photos, Photoshop PSD files, Illustrator files and so on)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wouldn't handle syncing, but a central file-server would achieve the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would require some enforcing and kitten-herding to get people to name things properly, but I think having a version folder for each asset (like someproject/asset/header&lt;em&gt;logo/v01/header&lt;/em&gt;logo_v01.psd) will basically be like a VCS, but easier to move between different revisions (no &lt;code&gt;vcs checkout blah -r 234&lt;/code&gt; when a client decides they prefered v02 more than v03)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will notice a big performance improvement if your app uses a lot of memory and the PC has enough RAM to keep up with it. I've found that 32bit .NET apps tend to start throwing out of memory exceptions when you get to around 1.6gb in use, but they start to thrash the disk due to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paging" rel="nofollow"&gt;paging&lt;/a&gt; long before that - so you end being I/O bound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, if you're bottleneck is CPU then 64bit is unlikely to help. If your bottleneck is is memory then you should see a big improvement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Will using Int64 improve performance and will the JIT compiler automatically make Int64 work on 32bit systems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Int64 already works on both 32bit and 64bit systems, but it'll be faster running on 64bit. So if you're mostly number crunching with Int64, running on a 64bit system should help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const byte _original_or_copy = 1;

//bool ooo = foo.original_or_copy();

Explaining selectors is also likely outside the scope of PyObjC, as those, too, are a feature of Objective-C, not PyObjC specifically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, this situation it's only good idea, if commit to VSS are few over month, because working with other SCM (than VSS) give you more flexiblity, but commint to VSS from SVN is expensive in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My solution was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VSS -&gt; SVN: I have linux script (or ant script, or XXX script) that copy from currrent update directory work of VSS to current SVN, then refresh SVN client and update/merge/commit to SVN. With this, you are update from changes of the rest of company that use VSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SVN -&gt; VSS: In this way, you need a checkout of all your modify files to VSS, then you can simply use the reverse script to copy from current update SVN directory (ignore .svn directories) and copy to current update VSS directory, update and commit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But remember, in a few case does worth your time to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, you will benefit the most if you realistically see those bridges as useful where scripting languages truly shine, rather than trying to build a whole application with them. While this &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; been done (with LimeChat, I'm using a RubyCocoa-written app right now), it is rare and likely will be for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

In the case of Linq, it is true that there will be no performance difference with simple CRUD queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But keep a few things in mind when making this decision: using any ORM couples you tightly to your data model.  A DBA has no freedom to make changes to the data model without forcing you to change your compiled code.  With stored procedures, you can hide these sorts of changes to an extent, since the parameter list and results set(s) returned from a procedure represent its contract, and the innards can be changed around, just so long as that contract is still met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And also, if Linq is used for more complex queries, tuning the database becomes a much more difficult task.  When a stored procedure is running slow, the DBA can totally focus on the code in isolation, and has lots of options, just so that contract is still satisfied when he/she is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen many, many cases where serious problems in an application were addressed by changes to the schema and code in stored procedures without any change to deployed, compiled code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would recommend that you only retrieve the data when you are going to use it. If you are not going to need it, there is no reason to waste resources by retrieving it in Page_Load. If you are going to need it multiple times throughout the page load, consider saving the query results to a private variable or collection so that the same data can be reused multiple times throughout the page load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd like to improve my understanding of MVC design pattern, as I'll be probably using it in the future (my job is mainly focused in developing .NET web applications). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can I ask to this community to help me find a starting direction on this subject? Articles, white papers, code samples, theory... anything you found helpful!&lt;/p&gt;

My question is then more focused on the best design solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I want is a set of "helper" classes that all have their own static methods such that if I get objects A, B, and C from a third party vendor, I can have helper classes with methods such as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
AHelper.RetrieveByID(string id);
AHelper.RetrieveByName(string name);
AHelper.DumpToDatabase();
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my AHelper, BHelper, and CHelper classes will all basically have the same methods, it seems to makes sense to move these methods to an interface that these classes then derive from.  However, wanting these methods to be static precludes me from having a generic interface or abstract class for all of them to derive from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could always make these methods non-static and then instantiate the objects first such as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
AHelper a = new AHelper();
a.DumpToDatabase();
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this code doesn't seem as intuitive to me.  What are your suggestions?  Should I abandon using an interface or abstract class altogether (the situation I'm in now) or can this possibly be refactored to accomplish the design I'm looking for?&lt;/p&gt;

Edit my original post or post an "answer"?  Anyway, I thought it might help to give an example of what is going on in AHelper.RetrieveByID() and BHelper.RetreiveByID()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, both of these methods are going up against a third party webservice that returns various a generic (castable) object using a Query method that takes in a pseudo-SQL string as its only parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, AHelper.RetrieveByID(string ID) might look like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
public static AObject RetrieveByID(string ID)
{
  QueryResult qr = webservice.query("SELECT Id,Name FROM AObject WHERE Id = '" + ID + "'");

  return (AObject)qr.records[0];
}

public static BObject RetrieveByID(string ID)
{
  QueryResult qr = webservice.query("SELECT Id,Name,Company FROM BObject WHERE Id = '" + ID + "'");

  return (BObject)qr.records[0];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully that helps.  As you can see, the two methods are similar, but the query can be quite a bit different based on the different object type being returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and Rob, I completely agree -- this is more than likely a limitation of my design and not the language. :)&lt;/p&gt;

It strikes me that you're storing two different things in the same table and that you might be better off creating 2 separate tables one for user templates and one for system templates.

&lt;p&gt;The reason this has come about is because of reference problems we experienced in our previous project.  On a frequent basis people would mistakenly add a reference to an assembly in the wrong location, which would mean it would work okay on their local environment, but might break on someone else's or on the build machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the reference paths are in the csproj.user files which means these must be committed to source control, so everyone has to share these same settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are thinking about having separate projects and solutions on our CI server, so that when we do a build it uses these projects rather than local development ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has obvious drawbacks such as an overhead to maintaining these separate files and the associated process that would need to be defined and followed, but it has benefits in that we would be in more control over &lt;em&gt;EXACTLY&lt;/em&gt; what happens in the production environment.  &lt;/p&gt;

For Mercurial, you specify which branch you want it to update from (let's say default) and then whenever you merge a branch into default, you can just have the server run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;hg update
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which updates your repository to the latest version of the branch you set it to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SVN is the same concept, you only check out which branch you want initially&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;svn co &amp;lt;http://host/repository/branchname/&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then you have your server update that with a cron job, ala&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;svn up
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory though, any VCS that supports branching (all the good ones do : git, mercurial, SVN, etc...), should be able to do something similar to this.&lt;/p&gt;

The whole communication between the client and the server is encrypted. A proxy sits between the server and the client, in order to cache it, you need to be able to read it, ie decrypt the encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do something to cache it. You basically do the SSL on your proxy, intercepting the SSL sent to the client. Basically the data is encrypted between the client and your proxy, it's decrypted, read and cached, and the data is encrypted and sent on the server. The reply from the server is likewise descrypted, read and encrypted. I'm not sure how you do this on major proxy software (like squid), but it is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only problem with this approach is that the proxy will have to use a self signed cert to encrypt it to the client. The client will be able to tell that a proxy in the middle has read the data, since the certificate will not be from the original site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You could just have a static method that takes a type parameter and performs the expected logic based on the type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You could create a virtual method in your abstract base, where you specify the SQL in the concrete class. So that contains all the common code that is required by both (e.g. exectuting the command and returning the object) while encapsulating the "specialist" bits (e.g. the SQL) in the sub classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prefer the second option, although its of course down to you. If you need me to go into further detail, please let me know and I will be happy to edit/update :)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;... clog up your memory and make your
  application really slow when they are
  not garbage collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's blindingly obvious, and I don't disagree. However:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;...you  are leaking memory to object
  that you no longer use... because
  there is a reference to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"memory is allocated to a program, and that program subsequently loses the ability to access it due to program logic flaws" (Wikipedia, "Memory leak")&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is an active reference to an object, which your program can access, then &lt;em&gt;by definition&lt;/em&gt; it is not leaking memory. A leak means that the object is no longer accessible (to you or to the OS/Framework), and will not be freed &lt;em&gt;for the lifetime of the operating system's current session&lt;/em&gt;. This is not the case here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Sorry to be a semantic Nazi... maybe I'm a bit old school, but leak has a very specific meaning. People tend to use "memory leak" these days to mean anything that consumes 2KB of memory more than they want...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, if you do not release an event handler, the object it's attached to will not be freed until your process' memory is reclaimed by the garbage collector at shutdown. But this behaviour is entirely expected, contrary to what you seem to imply. If you expect an object to be reclaimed, then you need to remove anything that may keep the reference alive, including event handlers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've also found that RCS is great in any situation where you need to sync files - I'm using that now instead of rsync for all of my syncing needs.  It's also easier to make backups - cloning a repository to another location/machine/disk means I can just push the changes to that location, which is even easier with a default push repository.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft even acknowledges it to be a memory leak:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Why Implement the WeakEvent Pattern?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Listening for events can lead to
  memory leaks. The typical technique
  for listening to an event is to use
  the language-specific syntax that
  attaches a handler to an event on a
  source. For instance, in C#, that
  syntax is: source.SomeEvent += new
  SomeEventHandler(MyEventHandler).&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;This technique creates a strong
  reference from the event source to the
  event listener. Ordinarily, attaching
  an event handler for a listener causes
  the listener to have an object
  lifetime that influenced by the object
  lifetime for the source (unless the
  event handler is explicitly removed).
  But in certain circumstances you might
  want the object lifetime of the
  listener to be controlled only by
  other factors, such as whether it
  currently belongs to the visual tree
  of the application, and not by the
  lifetime of the source. Whenever the
  source object lifetime extends beyond
  the object lifetime of the listener,
  the normal event pattern leads to a
  memory leak: the listener is kept
  alive longer than intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use WPF for a client app with large ToolWindows that can be dragged dropped, all the nifty stuff, and all compatible with in a XBAP.. But we had the same problem with some ToolWindows that weren't garbadge collected.. This was due to the fact that it was still dependent on event listeners.. Now this might not be a problem when you close your window and shut down your app. But if you are creating very large ToolWindows with a lot of commands, and all these commands gets re-evaluated over and over again, and people must use your application all day long.. I can tell you.. it really clogs up your memory and response time of your app..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I find it much easier to explain to my manager that we have a memory leak, than explaining to him that some objects are not garbadge collected due to some events that needs cleaning ;)&lt;/p&gt;

The problem with that is that it adds complexity when deploying the application. Such a proxy cache will have to be installed on a customers premises. For enterprise customers, it will also have to be made fault-tolerant and reliable. So that would probably mean some sort of failover or load balanced. And maybe even a shared distributed cache (memcached)...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such deployments will also incur additional support, development and testing costs. &lt;/p&gt;
