  &lt;p&gt;I don't find code formatted like that easier to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's fine, it is just a personal preference and we can disagree.  Format it the way you think is best and I'll respect it.  I frequently ask myself 'how should I format this or that thing?'  My answer is always to format it to improve readability, which I admit can be subjective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding your sample, I just like having that nicely aligned column on the right hand side, its sort of a quick "index" into the code on the left.  Having said that, I would probably avoid commenting every line like that anyway because the code itself shouldn't need that much explanation.  And if it does I tend to write a paragraph above the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But consider this example from the original poster.  Its easier to spot the comments in the second one in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (size-type i = 0; i&amp;lt;v.size(); i++) { // rehash:
    size-type ii = has(v[i].key)%b.size9); // hash
    v[i].next = b[ii]; // link
    b[ii] = &amp;amp;v[i];
}

for (size-type i = 0; i&amp;lt;v.size(); i++) {     // rehash:
    size-type ii = has(v[i].key)%b.size9);   // hash
    v[i].next = b[ii];                       // link
    b[ii] = &amp;amp;v[i];

&lt;p&gt;But whatever Microsoft calls it, I don't think a "new" definition is appropriate. It's complicated, because we don't live in a 100% managed world (even though Microsoft likes to pretend that we do, Microsoft itself does not live in such a world). When you say memory leak, you could mean that a program is consuming too much memory (that's a user's definition), or that a managed reference will not be freed until exit (as here), or that an unmanaged reference is not being properly cleaned up (that would be a real memory leak), or that unmanaged code called from managed code is leaking memory (another real leak).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, it's obvious what "memory leak" means, even though we're being imprecise. But it gets awfully tedious talking to some people, who call every over-consumption, or failure-to-collect a memory leak; and it's frustrating when these people are programmers, who supposedly know better. It's kind of important for technical terms to have unambiguous meanings, I think. Debugging is so much easier when they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway. Don't mean to turn this into an airy-fairy discussion about language. Just saying...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;matlab -wait -nosplash -nodesktop -r waitHello
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Matlab 7.1 (the version I have) there is an undocumented command line option -wait in matlab.bat. If it doesn't work for your version, you could probably add it in. Here's what I found. The command at the bottom that finally launches matlab is (line 153):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;start "MATLAB" %START_WAIT% "%MATLAB_BIN_DIR%\%MATLAB_ARCH%\matlab" %MATLAB_ARGS%
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relevant syntax of the start command (see "help start" in cmd.exe) in this case is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;start ["window title"] [/wait] myprogram.exe args ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit higher, among all of the documented command line options, I found (line 60):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;) else if (%opt%) == (-wait) (
  set START_WAIT=/wait
) else (
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So specifying -wait should do what you want, as long as you're also exiting matlab from your script (otherwise it will wait for you to terminate it interactively).&lt;/p&gt;

Of course, lots of enterprises are using it for internal apps. As far as scaling goes, liberal caching is the secret no matter what your language/framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at sites like twitter, sure they had issues. But they already admitted it was cause things were not scaled properly. Since they have implemented the changes they did things have been cruising along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing stopping us here where I work is no one knows ruby and doesn't really have much time to learn. &lt;/p&gt;

I've got no experience in the field, so I can't make a recommendation.  If you are still in college (or still have close ties), you should find out if any of your professors can make a recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey you linked is probably an excellent resource, too.  I'm sure there have been advancements since 1996, but the basics are unlikely to have fundamentally changed.  If the survey is well-written, then it would be well worth your time to read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you are clear that you have been working VB.Net.  This seems obvious but is something that apparently isn't (in my experience).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to give a code sample, if possible.  I've seen some horrible VB.Net (and C#) written by VB programmers who didn't seem to learn much in the transition to .Net.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be able to write in C# during the interview, if asked.  I know there aren't many real differences between the two, but I don't want to pay you to learn the new syntax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your specific question: I've asked that type of question before and what I wanted to hear about was how the underlying system and framework were the same.  If possible, talk about garbage collection, IDisposable, finalizers, the dangers of unsafe code blocks, stack vs heap, etc.  All the kind of stuff to show that you really understand the intricacies of the .Net framework.  Right or wrong, the heritage of VB brings with it an expectation of a lack of understand of lower level programming and windows in general (which, ironically enough, a c++ developer would have of a c# developer... and so on).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, how you frame your experience can make a world of difference.  If you position yourself as a .Net developer, rather than VB.Net or C#, the stupid, pseudo-religious, banter may not enter the conversation.  This of course requires that you actually know both VB.Net and C# at the time of the interview, but that's a good policy regardless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth of the matter is that if you find that the person interviewing you writes you off simply because you've previously been developing in VB.Net, it's likely not going to be a place you want to work at anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what VS setting I've changed or if it's a web.config setting or what, but I keep getting this error in the error list and yet all solutions build fine. Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Error   5   'CompilerGlobalScopeAttribute' is ambiguous in the namespace 'System.Runtime.CompilerServices'. C:\projects\MyProject\Web\Controls\EmailStory.ascx  609 184 C:\...\Web\
Error   6   'ArrayList' is ambiguous in the namespace 'System.Collections'. C:\projects\MyProject\Web\Controls\EmailStory.ascx.vb   13  28  C:\...\Web\
Error   7   'Exception' is ambiguous in the namespace 'System'. C:\projects\MyProject\Web\Controls\EmailStory.ascx.vb   37  21  C:\...\Web\

    [...etc...]

Error   90  'DateTime' is ambiguous in the namespace 'System'.  C:\projects\MyProject\Web\App_Code\XsltHelperFunctions.vb   13  8   C:\...\Web\
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, it's really annoying since there are blue squiggly underlines everywhere in the code, and filtering out relevant errors in the Error List pane is near impossible. I've checked the default ASP.Net web.config and machine.config but nothing seemed to stand out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit:&lt;/em&gt; Here's some of the source where the errors are occurring:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;'Error #5: whole line is blue underlined'
&amp;lt;%= addEmailToList.ToolTip %&amp;gt;

'Error #6: ArrayList is blue underlined'
Private _emails As New ArrayList()

'Error #7: Exception is blue underlined'
Catch ex As Exception

'Error #8: System.EventArgs is blue underlined'
Protected Sub Page_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Load

'Error #9: System.EventArgs is blue underlined'
Protected Sub sendMessage_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles sendMessage.Click

'Error #10: Array is blue underlined'
Me.emailSentTo.Text = Array.Join(";", mailToAddresses)

'Error #90: DateTime is blue underlined'
If DateTime.TryParse(data, dateValue) Then
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit&lt;/em&gt;: GacUtil results&lt;/p&gt;

But it let all our users get a whole ton of information that was mostly edited by two or three people pretty easily.  And with simple instructions on how to update before you do any editing (locking if necessary), and then dealing with conflicts (check what you updated and then delete your copy and perform an update) they were able to handle the repository thing pretty well, though I'm not sure they ever actually grew to like it.  :)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Good suggestion, but unfortunately they just return various shades of grey, when currently I'm running my application with the style CMFCVisualManagerOffice2007::Office2007_LunaBlue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CMFCVisualManagerOffice2007::GetTabFrameColors - the clrFace output param is grey?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps they're all masks on top of a single base hue for each theme?  Assuming you can determine which color scheme is in effect with CMFCVisualManagerOffice2007::GetStyle(), perhaps you can figure out what that hue is and then do some masking with the GetxxxColor() methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would you go about finding the best combination programmatically?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My best attempt so far (third or fourth algorithm) is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the longest shipper for each leg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliminate the most "expensive" one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the cheapest shipper for each leg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate the total cost &amp;amp; days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If days are acceptable, finish, else, goto 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quickly mocked-up in PHP (note that the test array below works swimmingly, but if you try it with the test array from above, it does not find the correct combination):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$shippers["leg1"] = array(
    "UPS"    =&amp;gt; array("days" =&amp;gt; 1, "cost" =&amp;gt; 4000),

    "FedEx"  =&amp;gt; array("days" =&amp;gt; 8, "cost" =&amp;gt; 1000)
);

$shippers["leg2"] = array(
    "UPS"    =&amp;gt; array("days" =&amp;gt; 1, "cost" =&amp;gt; 3500),
    "Conway" =&amp;gt; array("days" =&amp;gt; 2, "cost" =&amp;gt; 2800),
    "FedEx"  =&amp;gt; array("days" =&amp;gt; 4, "cost" =&amp;gt; 900)
);

$shippers["leg3"] = array(
    "UPS"    =&amp;gt; array("days" =&amp;gt; 1, "cost" =&amp;gt; 3500),
    "Conway" =&amp;gt; array("days" =&amp;gt; 2, "cost" =&amp;gt; 2800),

            $lowestCost = $shipper["cost"];
           }
          }

             //recalculate days and see if we are under max days...
          $totalDays += $cheapestShippers[$legName]['days']; 
         }
         //print "&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;totalDays: $totalDays&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;";
        }

        print "&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Chosen Shippers:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;";
        print_r($cheapestShippers);
        print "&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;";
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I may have to actually do some sort of thing where I literally make each combination one by one (with a series of loops) and add up the total "score" of each, and find the best one....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT:
To clarify, this isn't a "homework" assignment (I'm not in school). It is part of my current project at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The requirements (as always) have been constantly changing. If I were given the current constraints at the time I began working on this problem, I would be using some variant of the A* algorithm (or Dijkstra's or shortest path or simplex or something). But everything has been morphing and changing, and that brings me to where I'm at right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I guess that means I need to forget about all the crap I've done to this point and just go with what I know I should go with, which is a path finding algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, to use that method, you must have the problem correctly formulated to describe your requirements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, it may be possible to enumerate all possible paths, since you have such a small set. Such a thing won't scale, though. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, that's pretty much the situation my group faces.  We do web-app development primarily (but no desktop development at this time).  Software deployments are ugly and unwieldy even with our modest apps, and we've had far too many issues crop up in the two years I have been a part of this team (and company).  It's past time to do something about that, and the upshot is that we'll be able to kill two Joel Test birds with one stone (daily builds and one-step builds, neither of which exists in any form whatsoever).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I'm after here is some general insight on the kinds of things I need to be doing or thinking about, from people who have been in software development for longer than I have and also have bigger brains.  I'm confident that will be most of the people currently posting in the beta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relevant Tools:
Visual Build
Source Safe 6.0 (I know, but I can't do anything about whether or not we use Source Safe at this time.  That might be the next battle I fight.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tentatively, I've got a Visual Build project that does this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get source and place in local directory, including necessary DLLs needed for project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get config files and rename as needed (we're storing them in a special sub directory that isn't part of the actual application, and they are named according to use).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build using Visual Studio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Precompile using command line, copying into what will be a "build" directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy to destination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get any necessary additional resources - mostly things like documents, images, and reports that are associated with the project (and put into directory from step 5).  There's a lot of this stuff, and I didn't want to include it previously.  However, I'm going to only copy changed items, so maybe it's irrelevant.  I wasn't sure whether I really wanted to include this stuff in earlier steps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still need to coax some logging out of Visual Build for all of this, but I'm not at a point where I need to do that yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any advice or suggestions to make?  We're not currently using a Deployment Project, I'll note.  It would remove some of the steps necessary in this build I presume (like web.config swapping).&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a big fan of Ruby and  Rails and agree with everything that has been said, but I get the sense that there is a general assumption in the community that "Rails just isn't ready for prime-time yet."  (granted that community is generally less informed than I imagine the users of this site are)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think from a technical perspective the examples others have brought up show that you can in fact get the uptime and performance out of Rails that you expect from a Java or .Net stack.  The problem is, you can't build those kinds of highly performant, reliable applications in Rails with 30$/hr programmers.  Ruby and other dynamic languages seem to enable great programmers to become amazingly efficient and productive, but at the same time they just cripple the so-so programmers.  And considering that the vast majority of large IT shops have opted to higher the cheapest code monkeys they can find I think it would be a very painful transition for them to try to introduce Rails as a replacement for Java or .Net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, understand that Speech Recognition is a diverse and complicated subject, and it has many different applications. People tend to map this domain to the first thing that comes to their head (usually, that would be computers understanding what you are saying like in IVR systems). So first lets distinguise the concept into the main categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human-to-Machine:&lt;/strong&gt; Applications that deal with understanding what a human is saying, but the human knows he is talking to a machine and the &lt;em&gt;grammar&lt;/em&gt; is very limited. Examples are &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer automation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specialized: Pilots automating some controls for example (noise a huge problem) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IVR (Interactive Voice Response) systems like Google-411 or when you call the bank and the computer on the other side says "say 'service' to get customer service"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;human-to-human&lt;/strong&gt; (Spontaneous speech): This is a bigger, more complex problem. Here we can also break it down into different applciations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call Center: conversation between Agent-Customer, phone quality, compressed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intelligence: radio/phone/live conversations between 2 or more individuals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Speech-To-Text is not what you should be saying that you care about. What you care about is solving a problem. Different technologies are used to solve different problems. See an overview &lt;a href="http://knol.google.com/k/csmba/speech-analytics/2p76v0g9rhval/3#" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; of some of them. to summarize, other approaches are Phonetic transcription, LVCSR and direct based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, are you interested in being the PHd behind the technology? you would need a Masters equivalent involving &lt;em&gt;Signal processing&lt;/em&gt; and probably a PHd to be cutting edge. In which case, you will work for a company that develops the actual &lt;strong&gt;speech engine&lt;/strong&gt;. Companies like Nuance and IBM are the big ones, but also Phillips and other startups exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you want to be the one implementing applications, you will not be working on the engine, but working on building application that USE the engine. A good analogy I think is form the gaming industry:
Are you developing the graphic engine (like the Cry engine), or working on one of several hundred games, all use the same graphic engine?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong, there is plenty to work on the quality of the search also outside the IBM/Nuance of the world. The engine is usually very open, and there are a lot of algorithmic tweaking to be done that can dramatically affect performance. Each business application has different constraints and cost/benefit function, so you can make experiments for many years building  better voice recognition based applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;one more thing: in general, you would also want to have good statistics background the lower in the stack you want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At this point in time, I'm mainly interested in being able to create applications that allow automation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good, we are converging here... Then you have no interest in "Speech-to-Text". That buzzwords takes you to the world of full transcription, a place you do not need to go to. You should be focusing on some of the more Human-to-Machine technologies like Voice XML and the ones used in IVR systems (Nuance is the biggest player there)&lt;/p&gt;

JavaScript can add, remove and modify nodes on the DOM tree to make changes to the page. I find it very nice to work with (browser bugs aside), and very different from the way my server-side code has to generate the page in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is: what server-side frameworks/languages build a page by treating it as a DOM tree from the beginning - inserting nodes instead of echoing strings? I think it would be very helpful if the client-side and server-side code both saw the page the same way. You could certainly hack something like this together in any web server language, but a framework dedicated to creating a page this way could make some very nice optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;

To be specific, here are some issues we had: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Client side scripting caused issues since even simple grids are not rendered as html tables but rather javascript arrays of arrays. While they do offer a bloated client scripting library, it was sparsely documented and overkill most of the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infragistics releases a new version of its product 3 times a year. In a development cycle that means you have to "update" in a pattern that is out of whack with your actual release cycle. In our case we worked on the project for much longer than 4 months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infragistics client libraries were thrown off by MasterPages. This &lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt; be fixed but I'm sure any time there's a new MS technology e.g. UpdatePanels/MVC, you have some additional complexity getting it to work with Infragistics (I assume most 3rd party libraries too)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overkill. 3rd party tools are nice but often they are "one size fits all" which means if you've got a simple task (in our case it was a grid that users needed to "re-order") and you use one of these libraries, you're getting a rocket launcher where a simple rifle will do. All the unnecessary features just add complexity and pain - especially later on when you start having to do unanticipated things with the project.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first suggestion would be to elicit suggestions from the other engineers about what they feel should be covered, and what guidelines they feel are important. Enforcing any kind of guidelines requires a degree of buy-in from people. If you suddenly drop a document on them that specifies how to write code you'll encounter resistance, whether you're the most junior or senior guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you have a set of proposals then send them out to the team for feedback and review. Again, get people to all buy into them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may already be informal coding practices that are adopted (e.g prefixing member variables, camelcase function names). If this exists, and most code conforms to it, then it will pay to formalize its use. Adopting a contrary standard is going to cause more grief than it's worth, even if it's something generally recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's also worth considering refactoring existing code to meet the new coding-standards. This can seem like a waste of time, but having code that does not meet the standards can be counter-productive as you will have a mish-mash of different styles. It also leaves people in a dilemma whether code in a certain module should conform to the new standard or follow the existing code style. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Figure out how you want your automated build to be triggered.  Whether it is hooking it up to CruiseControl or running a nightly build task using Scheduled Tasks.  CruiseControl or TeamCity is probably the best choice for this, because they include a lot of tools you can use to make this step easier.  CruiseControl is free and TeamCity is free to a point, where you might have to pay for it depending on how big the project is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ok, by this point you will be pretty comfortable with the tools.  Now you are ready to add more tasks based on what you want to do for testing, deployment, and etc...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Do you use source control? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you make a build in one step? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you make daily builds? &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm just curious what free/cheap (but good) tools exist for the small development shops that don't have large bank accounts to use to achieve a positive answer on these questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For source control I know Subversion is a great solution, and if you are a one man shop you could even use SourceGear's &lt;a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/index.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Vault&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use NAnt for my larger projects, but have yet to set up a script to build my installers as well as running the obfusication tools all as a single step.  Any other suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can answer yes to the building in a single step, I think creating daily builds would be easy, but what tools would you recommend for automating those daily builds?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a one or two man team, it's already been discussed on SO that you can use FogBugz On Demand, but what other bug tracking solutions exist for small teams?&lt;/p&gt;

The clue is in the word standard, the world would be a much easier place to code in if each organization hadn't decided to write their own. Who really thinks learning a new set of 'standards' each time you change teams/projects/roles is a good use of anyone's time.
The most you should ever do is summarize the critical points but I'd advise against doing even that because what is critical varies from person to person.
Two other points I'd like to make on coding standards&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Close is good enough - Changing code to follow coding standards to the letter is a waste of time as long as the code is close enough.&lt;/li&gt;

Easy explanation: He said the update works on one machine, but not on the other. I had similar problems in the past and re-installing helped to solve some of them. And it is trivial to do.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use it so the classes can have a list of their available objects without the class instance, for example, we have a method that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class function AvailableObjects: string; override;
begin
  Result := 'Object1, Object2';
end;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's ugly but necessary, this way we can instantiate just what is needed, instead of having all the classes instantianted just to search for the available objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a simple example, but the application itself is a client-server application which has all the classes available in just one server, and multiple different clients which might not need everything the server has and will never need an object instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is much easier to maintain than having one different server application for each client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope the example was clear.&lt;/p&gt;

In my experience, enterprise means "safe". Companies that are looking for an enterprise solution typically choose a technology stack that's supported by large vendors. This way they know that they can get support and probably consultancy in exchange for spending large amounts of money. It's the whole "nobody ever got fired for buying IBM" approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another factor to consider is ubiquity. There's no doubt that right now Ruby is still seen as a somewhat exotic language and the availability of skilled Ruby programmers reflects this. Technically, Ruby &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; more sophisticated than Java or C#, being closer to Smalltalk in terms of OO purity and closer to LISP in terms of meta-programming facilities. Suffice to say, companies are going to find it easier to get Java or .NET programmers for a low rate from body shops, than they are Ruby programmers. That's not to insult Java or .NET programmers, rather it's a reflection of the fact that there are many employers who still regard software development as something to be done by the cheapest bidder, rather than something that should be done right. Java and .NET programmers are pretty much a commodity now, so can be offered for less cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically, Ruby on Rails can scale just as well as Java, .NET or PHP etc. The same basic principles apply of measuring where the bottlenecks are, tuning your SQL queries, minimizing I/O, possibly denormalizing the database schema if appropriate and making judicious use of caching etc. If you do need to build the next eBay or Amazon then you should hand-roll and hand tune your own solution, just as eBay and Amazon have done. J2EE has the edge on legacy integration, but that's not the use-case that Rails is optimized for anyway&amp;mdash;Rails is all about building new CRUD apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's no doubt that as it currently stands Ruby is one of the slower performing languages; a lot of investment is being made in this area, so expect the situation to improve over the next few years just as it has done for Java since it first came out. There are lots of interesting developments taking place in the field of Ruby VMs and alternatives to the MRI (Matz Ruby Interpreter). Personally I think that JRuby is one to keep an eye on. It's backed by Sun (go figure) and because it's a Java implementation of Ruby, it's a neat Trojan horse you can use to get Ruby into your enterprise, via its existing JVM infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think Rails is quite there for the enterprise yet and in many ways I hope it never is. I don't particularly want to see my favourite framework get bogged down by some of the mediocrity or confusion of multi-vendor choice that has been evident to me in the J2EE world. Happily DHH seems determined that Rails should continue to be opinionated software for scratching his own itch, rather than trying to be all things to all companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, in MS SQL Server, triggers are fired once per sql command, and not per row.  For example, the following sql statement will execute the trigger only once.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;UPDATE tblUsers
SET Age = 11
WHERE State = 'NY'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people, including myself, were under the impression that the triggers are fired on every row, but this isn't the case.  If you have a sql statement like the one above that may change data in more than one row, you might want to include a cursor to update all records affected by the trigger.  You can see how this can get convoluted very quickly.  &lt;/p&gt;

  exactly being requested?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure ASP.NET is enabled in the IIS Administration Console under "Web
  Service Extensions."  &lt;a href="http://www.dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/photos/davetrux/images/295487/original.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;Make sure everything is set to allowed for your different versions of the framework.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to use a generic apps account but that login "could not find" any of the stored procedures even though they existed and the login has explicit permissions to run them (and was also tested successfully, as that user, in SQL Management Studio).  It wasn't until we granted that login "sa" privileges that we could actually access the database at all through the application. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first came out of uni, I found that it had severly un equipped me to deal with the real world. Yes I knew some JAVA basics and some philosophy (don't ask) but that was about it. When I first got my job it was a little daunting to say the least. Let me tell you I was probably one of the biggest cowboys around, I would hack together a little bug fix / algorithm with no comments / testing / documentation and ship it out the door. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to be under the supervision of a kind and &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; patient senior programmer. Luckily for me, he decided to sit down with me and spend 1-2 weeks  going through my very hacked togethor code. He would explain where I'd gone wrong, the finer points of c and pointers (boy did that confuse me!). We managed to write a pretty decent class/module in about a week. All I can say is that if the senior dev hadn't invested the time to help me along the right path, I probably wouldn't have lasted very long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happily, 2 years down the line, I would hope that some of my collegues might even consider me an average programmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take home points&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

But the CLR that .NET 3.5 runs on &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa663314.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;is still CLR 2.0.&lt;/a&gt;  (the link is to the same explanation re: .NET 3.0; I couldn't immediately find this info on 3.5.

All you have to do is have the free 3.5 framework on your server.

&lt;p&gt;Embedding queries in your code couples you tightly to your data model.  Stored procedures are a good form of contractual programming, meaning that a DBA has the freedom to alter the data model and the code in the procedure, so long as the contract represented by the stored procedure's inputs and outputs is maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuning production databases can be extremely difficult when the queries are buried in the code and not in one central, easy to manage location.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Easier to maintain - don't need to run a SQL script to update queries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Easier to port to another DB - no procs to port&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, I think you have that backwards. IMHO, SQL in code is pain to maintain because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you end up repeating yourself in related code blocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQL isn't supported as a language in many IDE's so you have just a series of un-error checked strings performing tasks for you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;changes in a data type, table name or constraint are far more prevalent than swapping out an entire databases for a new one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your level of difficulty increases as your query grows in complexity &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and testing an inline query requires building the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of Stored Procs as methods you call from the database object - they are much easier to reuse, there is only one place to edit and in the event that you do change DB providers, the changes happen in your Stored Procs and not in your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the performance gains of stored procs is minimal as Stu said before me and you can't put a break point in a stored procedure (yet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that would be helpful is unit tests.  The more of your codebase you have covered the more confident you can be that changes in one area didn't inadvertently affected another area.  I've found this quite useful, as sometimes I'll change something and forget that it would affect another part of the app, and the unit tests showed the problem right away.  Passed unit tests won't guarantee that you haven't broken anything, but they can help increase confidence that changes you make are working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Command pattern encapsulates a request
  as an object and gives it a known
  public interface. Command Pattern
  ensures that every object receives its
  own commands and provides a decoupling
  between sender and receiver. A sender
  is an object that invokes an
  operation, and a receiver is an object
  that receives the request and acts on
  it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's an example for you.  There are many ways you can do this, but I am going to take an interface base approach to make the code more testable for you.  I am not sure what language you prefer, but I am writing this in C#.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, create an interface that describes a Command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public interface ICommand
{
    void Execute();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, create command objects that will implement the command interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class CutCommand : ICommand
{
    public void Execute()
    {
        // Put code you like to execute when the CutCommand.Execute method is called.
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, we need to setup our invoker or sender object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class TextOperations
{
    public void Invoke(ICommand command)
    {
        command.Execute();
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, create the client object that will use the invoker/sender object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class Client
{
    static void Main()
    {
        TextOperations textOperations = new TextOperations();
        textOperation.Invoke(new CutCommand());
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you can take this example and put it into use for the application you are working on.  If you would like more clarification, just let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

None of these boxes are especially critical and they're all using RAID.  To date, I've therefore been doing backups of the boxes by having a cron job upload tarballs containing the contents of /etc, MySQL dumps and other such changing, non-packaged data to a box at our geographically separate hosting centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've realised, however that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the tarballs are sufficient to rebuild from, but it's certainly not a painless process to do so (I recently tried this out as part of a hardware upgrade of one of the boxes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long-term, the process isn't sustainable.  Each of the boxes is currently producing a tarball of a couple of hundred MB each day, 99% of which is the same as the previous day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;partly due to the size issue, the backup process requires more manual intervention than I want (to find whatever 5GB file is inflating the size of the tarball and kill it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;again due to the size issue, I'm leaving stuff out which it would be nice to include - the contents of users' home directories, for example.  There's almost nothing of value there that isn't in source control (and these aren't our main dev boxes), but it would be nice to keep them anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there must be a better way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my question is, how should I be doing this properly?  The requirements are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;needs to be an offsite backup (one of the main things I'm doing here is protecting against fire/whatever)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;should require as little manual intervention as possible (I'm lazy, and box-herding isn't my main job)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;should continue to scale with a couple more boxes, slightly more data, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;preferably free/open source (cost isn't the issue, but especially for backups, openness seems like a good thing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an option to produce some kind of DVD/Blu-Ray/whatever backup from time to time wouldn't be bad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first thought was that this kind of incremental backup was what tar was created for - create a tar file once each month, add incrementally to it.  rsync results to remote box.  But others probably have better suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

I think that is, in part, an answer to the question. Getting it "right" is hard enough, competing agains the likes of VI/VIM/Emacs would be extremely tough -- most people who use these editors are "die hard" fans, and you'd have to give them a compelling reason to move to another editor.

&lt;p&gt;In your case I'd just use rsync to mirror all important directories onto a remote server. Something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;rsync -av --delete src-dir remote-user@remote-host:dest-dir
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is incremental and takes less time and network bandwidth. Also, by using --delete you can  remove big redundant files at any time and save space on the backup volume automatically. Of course, you wont be able to go back in time to deleted files once the backup has been updated (presumably once a day).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rsync can be set up to use ssh so that your files' contents are transferred securely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might also consider sharing the user home directories from a central server through NFS or SMB. This will save some space and will allow users to switch machines or simply ssh around easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As suggested by Komradekatz, you can disallow access to tables (for the username/password combo that connects to the DB) and allow SP access only. That way if someone gets the username and password to your database they can execute SP's but can't access the tables or any other part of the DB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Of course executing sprocs may give them all the data they need but that would depend on the sprocs that were available. Giving them access to the tables gives them access to everything.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an important exception however. IEnumerable involves an overhead of Current() and MoveNext() that is what the foreach loop is actually compiled into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have a simple array of structs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;//C#
int[] valueTypeArray;
for(int i=0; i &amp;lt; valueTypeArray.Length; ++i) {
     int item = valueTypeArray[i];
     //do stuff
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is quicker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a discussion with @Steven Sudit (see comments) I think my original advice may be out of date or mistaken, so I ran some tests:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// create a list to test with
var theList = Enumerable.Range(0, 100000000).ToList();

// time foreach
var sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();
foreach (var item in theList)
{
    int inLoop = item;
}
Console.WriteLine("list  foreach: " + sw.Elapsed.ToString());

sw.Reset();
sw.Start();

// time for
int cnt = theList.Count;
for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; cnt; i++)
{
    int inLoop = theList[i];
}
Console.WriteLine("list  for    : " + sw.Elapsed.ToString());

// now run the same tests, but with an array
var theArray = theList.ToArray();

sw.Reset();
sw.Start();

foreach (var item in theArray)
{
    int inLoop = item;
}
Console.WriteLine("array foreach: " + sw.Elapsed.ToString());

sw.Reset();
sw.Start();

// time for
cnt = theArray.Length;
for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; cnt; i++)
{
    int inLoop = theArray[i];
}
Console.WriteLine("array for    : " + sw.Elapsed.ToString());

Console.ReadKey();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I ran this in release with all optimisations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;list  foreach: 00:00:00.5137506
list  for    : 00:00:00.2417709
array foreach: 00:00:00.1085653
array for    : 00:00:00.0954890
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then debug without optimisations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;list  foreach: 00:00:01.1289015
list  for    : 00:00:00.9945345
array foreach: 00:00:00.6405422
array for    : 00:00:00.4913245
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it appears fairly consistent, &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; is quicker than &lt;code&gt;foreach&lt;/code&gt; and arrays are quicker than generic lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this is across 100,000,000 iterations and the difference is about .4 of a second between the fastest and slowest methods. Unless you're doing massive performance critical loops it just isn't worth worrying about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anonymous delegates are not currently implemented in VB.Net, but both C# and VB.Net should be able to do lambdas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C#&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;myList&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;().ForEach(name =&amp;gt; Console.WriteLine(name));

&lt;p&gt;VB.Net&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;myList(Of String)().ForEach(Function(name) Console.WriteLine(name))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Grauenwolf pointed out the above VB won't compile since the lambda doesn't return a value. A normal ForEach loop as others have suggested is probably the easiest for now, but as usual it takes a block of code to do what C# can do in one line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a trite example of why this might be useful: this gives you the ability to pass in the loop logic from another scope than where the IEnumerable exists, so you don't even have to expose it if you don't want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you have a list of relative url paths that you want to make absolute:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public IEnumerable&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; Paths(Func&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; formatter) {
    List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; paths = new List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;()
    {
        "/about", "/contact", "/services"
    };

    return paths.ForEach(formatter);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then you could call the function this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var hostname = "myhost.com";
var formatter = f =&amp;gt; String.Format("http://{0}{1}", hostname, f);
IEnumerable&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; absolutePaths = Paths(formatter);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the user is determined to close your app (and knowledgeable) enough to press alt+f4, they'll most likely also be knowledgeable enough to run task manager and kill your application instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least with alt+f4 your app can do a graceful shutdown, rather than just making people kill it. From experience, people killing your app means corrupt config files, broken databases, half-finished tasks that you can't resume, and many other painful things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My opinion is very much the latter. If they've compromised your application to the point where they can re-write it they have plenty of other attacks they can use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sql injections can still be performed against those sprocs if they dynamically inline code, so the golden rule still applies, all user input must always be parametrised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that the pointer you get back from new[] is not always the same as the address you pass in (5.3.4, note 12 in the standard seems to confirm that this is correct), but I don't see how you can allocate a buffer for the array to go in if this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following example shows the problem. Compiled with Visual Studio, this example results in memory corruption:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;new&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;

class A
{
    public:

    A() : data(0) {}
    virtual ~A() {}
    int data;
};

int main()
{
    const int NUMELEMENTS=20;

    char *pBuffer = new char[NUMELEMENTS*sizeof(A)];
    A *pA = new(pBuffer) A[NUMELEMENTS];

    // With VC++, pA will be four bytes higher than pBuffer
    printf("Buffer address: %x, Array address: %x\n", pBuffer, pA);

    // Debug runtime will assert here due to heap corruption
    delete[] pBuffer;

    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the memory, the compiler seems to be using the first four bytes of the buffer to store a count of the number of items in it. This means that because the buffer is only &lt;code&gt;sizeof(A)*NUMELEMENTS&lt;/code&gt; big, the last element in the array is written into unallocated heap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the question is can you find out how much additional overhead your implementation wants in order to use placement new[] safely? Ideally, I need a technique that's portable between different compilers. Note that, at least in VC's case, the overhead seems to differ for different classes. For instance, if I remove the virtual destructor in the example, the address returned from new[] is the same as the address I pass in.&lt;/p&gt;

This "program" is a script that leverages the strengths of Rsync and the linux file system.  Using hardlinked files, each backup snapshot contains your entire data set but only requires additional space for the changed files.  Combining that with Rsync's ability to only send changed files and delete removed files, you get a backup system that has very low overhead for daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly backups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system can even be very versatile as I have used this system to backup both windows and linux boxes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some negatives to this system: no inherent encryption, no compression of data on the "storage" side, etc, but most of the can be resolved with outside tools.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I heard about VisualSVN and
  integration with visual studio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Point to note, VisualSVN (the one that integrates with VStudio) is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a server technology at all, it is simply a integrated GUI front end to SVN, and in fact works &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; TortoiseSVN (which is &lt;strong&gt;required&lt;/strong&gt; to be installed).  However, VisualSVN is GREAT and defnitely worth the $50 per developer to use it.  I used it daily and it saves me SO much time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also VisualSVN Server, which will take care of the server side of things and the setup is absolutely dead simple.  As long as you have an internet facing server and copious amounts of bandwidth (though SVN is not much of a bandwidth hog) you should be fine to host it yourself.  Oh yeah, and VisualSVN &lt;em&gt;Server&lt;/em&gt; is completely FREE!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, having your repository hosted off-site is definitely always an option.
I use dreamhost for this now and couldn't be happier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So really you could save yourself some money by running your own subversion server and you'll never have to worry about what happens to your code if your hosting company goes belly up.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would start with tortoise because it is free and is really easy to use.  If you find you really need integration with VS then by all means try out visual svn.  In my experience source control &amp;lt;-&gt; editor integration is most useful for automatically opening files when you edit them.  Subversion doesn't require you to open files so that big advantage is gone.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code behind is supported in Master Pages, so you could put some logic in your one Master Page to decide what should be displayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've seen several sites set cookies based on user clicks (to change font size, or page width), and then have different CSS files applied based on the value of those cookies.  If no cookie is present, display a default look and feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thought here, if you are simply trying to switch out CSS is to set your style tag to run at the server, and assign properties to it at run-time.  Once again this would require the use of a single master page, and putting code the code-behind of the master page, probably in the PreInit event handler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I've never implemented this solution I'm not sure if the whole &amp;lt;HEAD&amp;gt; tag has to run at the server or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Stored Procedures are MORE maintainable because:
     * You don't have to recompile your C# app whenever you want to change some SQL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll end up recompiling it anyway when datatypes change, or you want to return an extra column, or whatever. The number of times you can 'transparently' change the SQL out from underneath your app is pretty small on the whole&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You end up reusing SQL code.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programming languages, C# included, have this amazing thing, called a function. It means you can invoke the same block of code from multiple places! Amazing! You can then put the re-usable SQL code inside one of these, or if you want to get really high tech, you can use a library which does it for you. I believe they're called Object Relational Mappers, and are pretty common these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Code repetition is the worst thing you can do when you're trying to build a maintainable application!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agreed, which is why storedprocs are a bad thing. It's much easier to refactor and decompose (break into smaller parts) code into functions than SQL into... blocks of SQL?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You have 4 webservers and a bunch of windows apps which use the same SQL code Now you realized there is a small problem with the SQl code so do you rather...... change the proc in 1 place or push the code to all the webservers, reinstall all the desktop apps(clickonce might help) on all the windows boxes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are your windows apps connecting directly to a central database? That seems like a HUGE security hole right there, and bottleneck as it rules out server-side caching. Shouldn't they be connecting via a web service or similar to your web servers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, push 1 new sproc, or 4 new webservers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; easier to push one new sproc, but in my experience, 95% of 'pushed changes' affect the code and not the database. If you're pushing 20 things to the webservers that month, and 1 to the database, you hardly lose much if you instead push 21 things to the webservers, and zero to the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;More easily code reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you explain how? I don't get this. Particularly seeing as the sprocs probably aren't in source control, and therefore can't be accessed via web-based SCM browsers and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;More cons:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storedprocs live in the database, which appears to the outside world as a black box. Simple things like wanting to put them in source control becomes a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's also the issue of sheer effort. It might make sense to break everything down into a &lt;a href="http://ptrthomas.wordpress.com/2006/06/06/java-call-stack-from-http-upto-jdbc-as-a-picture/"&gt;million tiers&lt;/a&gt; if you're trying to justify to your CEO why it just cost them 7 million dollars to build some forums, but otherwise creating a storedproc for every little thing is just extra donkeywork for no benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

I am aware that Microsoft has a rule of thumb stating that a SSRS report should take no longer than 30 seconds to execute.  However sometimes gargantuan reports are a preferred evil due to external forces such complying with state laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At my place of employment, we have an asp.net (2.0) app that we have migrated from Crystal Reports to SSRS. Due to the large user base and complex reporting UI requirements we have a set of screens that accepts user inputted parameters and creates schedules to be run over night. Since the application supports multiple reporting frameworks we do not use the scheduling/snapshot facilities of SSRS. All of the reports in the system are generated by a scheduled console app which takes user entered parameters and generates the reports with the corresponding reporting solutions the reports were created with. In the case of SSRS reports, the console app generates the SSRS reports and exports them as PDFs via the SSRS web service API. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far SSRS has been much easier to deal with than Crystal with the exception of a certain 25,000 page report that we have recently converted from crystal reports to SSRS. The SSRS server is a 64bit 2003 server with 32 gigs of ram running SSRS 2005. All of our smaller reports work fantastically, but we are having trouble with our larger reports such as this one.  Unfortunately, we can't seem to generate the aforemention report through the web service API. The following error occurs roughly 30-35 minutes into the generation/export:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exception Message: The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a receive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web service call is something I'm sure you all have seen before:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;data = rs.Render(this.ReportPath, this.ExportFormat, null, deviceInfo,
   selectedParameters, null, null, out encoding, out mimeType, out usedParameters, 
   out warnings, out streamIds);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The odd thing is that this report will run/render/export if the report is run directly on the reporting server using the report manager. The proc that produces the data for the report runs for about 5 minutes. The report renders in SSRS native format in the browser/viewer after about 12 minutes. Exporting to pdf through the browser/viewer in the report manager takes an additional 55 minutes. This works reliably and it produces a whopping 1.03gb pdf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the more obvious things I've tried to get the report working via the web service API:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set the HttpRuntime ExecutionTimeout
value to 3 hours on the report
server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;disabled http keep alives on the report server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increased the script timeout on the report server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set the report to never time out on the server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set the report timeout to several hours on the client call  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the tweaks I have tried, I am fairly comfortable saying that any timeout issues have been eliminated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based off of my research of the error message, I believe that the web service API does not send chunked responses by default. This means that it tries to send all 1.3gb over the wire in one response. At a certain point, IIS throws in the towel. Unfortunately the API abstracts away web service configuration so I can't seem to find a way to enable response chunking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does anyone know of anyway to reduce/optimize the PDF export phase and or the size of the PDF without lowering the total page count?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a way to turn on response chunking for SSRS?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does anyone else have any other theories as to why this runs on the server but not through the API?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: After reading kcrumley's post I began to take a look at the average page size by taking file size / page count. Interestingly enough on smaller reports the math works out so that each page is roughly 5K. Interestingly, when the report gets larger this "average" increases. An 8000 page report for example is averaging over 40K/page. Very odd. I will also add that the number of records per page is set except for the last page in each grouping, so it's not a case where some pages have more records than another. &lt;/p&gt;

Is CSLA right for your project? It depends. I would personally consider CSLA for desktop based applications that does not value unit testing as a high priority. CSLA is great if you want to easily scale to an n-tier application. CSLA tends to get some flack because it does not allow pure unit testing. This is true, however like anything in technology, I believe that there is &lt;em&gt;No One True Way&lt;/em&gt;. Unit testing may not be something you are undertaking for a specific project. What works for one team and one project may not work for another team or other project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also many misconceptions in regards to CSLA. It is not an ORM. it is not a competitor to NHibernate (in fact using CLSA Business Objects &amp;amp; NHibernate as data access fit really well together). It formalises the concept of a &lt;em&gt;Mobile Object&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. How many people are using CSLA?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Based on the &lt;a href="http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/default.aspx"&gt;CSLA Forums&lt;/a&gt;, I would say there are quite a number of CSLA based projects out there. Honestly though, I have no idea how many people are actually using it. I have used it in the past on two projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. What are the pros and cons?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While it is difficult to summarise in a short list, here is some of the pro/con's that come to mind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Pros:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's easy to get new developers up
to speed. The CSLA book and sample
app are great resources to get up to speed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Validation framework is truly world class - and has been "borrowed" for many many other non-CSLA projects and technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;n-Level Undo within your business objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Config line change for n-Tier scalability (Note: not even a
recompile is necessary)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key technologies are abstracted from the "real" code. When WCF was
introduced, it had minimal impact on
CSLA code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is possible to share your business objects between windows and web projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSLA promotes the normalization of &lt;em&gt;behaviour&lt;/em&gt; rather than the normalization of &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; (leaving the database for data normalization).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cons:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difficulty in unit testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of Separation of Concern (generally your business objects have data access code inside them).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As CSLA promotes the normalization of &lt;em&gt;behavior&lt;/em&gt;, rather than the normalization of &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt;, and this can result in business objects that are named similarly, but have different purposes. This can cause some confusion and a feeling like you are not reusing objects appropriately. That said, once the physiological leap is taken, it more than makes sense - it seems inappropriate to structure objects the "old" way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's not "in fashion" to build applications this way. You may struggle to get developers who are passionate about the technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. After reading this does CSLA really not fit in with TDD?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I haven't found an effective way to do TDD with CSLA. That said, I am sure there are many smarter people out there than me that may have tried this with greater success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. What are my alternatives?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Domain-Driven-Design is getting big push at the moment (and rightfully so - it's fantastic for some applications). There are also a number of interesting patterns developing from the introduction of LINQ (and LINQ to SQL, Entity Framework, etc). Fowlers book &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0321127420"&gt;PoEAA&lt;/a&gt;, details many patterns that may be suitable for your application. Note that some patterns are competing (i.e. Active Record and Repository), and thus are meant to be used for specific scenarios. While CSLA doesn't exactly match any of the patterns described in that book, it most closely resembles Active Record (although I feel it is short-sighted to claim an exact match for this pattern).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. If you have stopped using it or decided against why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I didn't fully recommend CSLA for my last project, because I believe the scope of the application is too large for the benefits CSLA provides. &lt;br /&gt;
I would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; use CSLA on a web project. I feel there are other technologies better suited to building applications in that environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, while CSLA is anything but a &lt;em&gt;silver bullet&lt;/em&gt;, it is appropriate for some scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;

This point in time will be called differently in different places.  As I write this, it's 00:27 on Tuesday in Germany, 23:27 on Monday in the UK and 18:27 on Monday in New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To take an example method: getDay returns the day of the week in the local timezone.  Right now, for a user in Germany, it would return 2.  For a user in the UK or US, it would return 1.  In an hour's time, it will return 2 for the user in the UK (because it will then be 00:27 on Tuesday there).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ..UTC.. methods deal with the representation of the time in UTC (also known as GMT).  In winter, this is the same timezone as the UK, in summer it's an hour behind the time in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's summer as I write this.  getUTCDay will return 1 (Monday), getUTCHours will return 22, getUTCMinutes will return 27.  So it's 22:27 on Monday in the UTC timezone.  Whereas the plain get... functions will return different values depending on where the user is, the getUTC.. functions will return those same values no matter where the user is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a table with a margin-bottom of 19px. Below that I have a form that contains some fieldsets. One of them is floated right. The problem is that the margin-bottom is not getting the full 19px in IE7. I've gone through all of the IE7 css/margin/float bugs that I can think of and have tried remedies but have been unsuccessful. I have been googling for a while now and cannot find anything that is helping out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrapping the form or fieldset in an unstyled div. No apparent change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nixing the margin-bottom on the table and instead wrapping that with a div and giving it a padding-bottom of 19px. No apparent change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nixing the margin-bottom on the table and adding a div with a fixed height of 19px. No apparent change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Putting a clear between the table and the fieldset.&lt;/li&gt;

The application was a trading system. CSLA is designed to be at that layer just below the UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think about your standard complex line-of-business application you may have a form with many fields, many rules for those fields (including cross-field validation rules), you may invoke a modal dialog to edit some child object, you may want to be able to be able to cancel such dialogs and revert back to a previous state. CSLA supports this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's cons are that it has a bit of a learning curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key thing to remember is to use CSLA to model how a &lt;strong&gt;user&lt;/strong&gt; interacts with forms on some application. The most efficient way for me was to design the UI and understand it's flows, behaviour and validation rules before building the CSLA objects. Don't have your CSLA objects drive UI design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also found it very useful to be able to use CSLA business objects server side to validate objects sent from clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also had built in mechanisms to perform validation asynchronously against web service (i.e. checking the credit limit range of a counterparty against a master).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSLA enforces a strong seperation between your UI, BusinessLogic and Persistance and we wrote a load of unit tests against them. It may not be strictly TDD because you are driving it from UI design, that doesn't mean it isn't testable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only real alternative is creating your own model \ business objects, but pretty soon you end up implementing features that CSLA offers out of the box (INotifyPropertyChanged, IDataErrorInfo, PushState, PopState etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

  for(int i = 0; i &amp;lt; NUMELEMENTS; ++i)
  {
    pA[i].~A();
  }    

  delete[] pBuffer;

  return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the method you use, make sure you manually destroy each of those items in the array before you delete pBuffer, as you could end up with leaks ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt;: I haven't compiled this, but I think it should work (I'm on a machine that doesn't have a C++ compiler installed). It still indicates the point :) Hope it helps in some way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason it needs to keep track of the number of elements is so that it can iterate through them when you call delete on the array and make sure the destructors are called on each of the objects. If it doesn't know how many there are it wouldn't be able to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So are you going to accept an answer?? ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scripts will be triggered upon certain events and may stay resident for a period of time. For example upon startup a script may define several options which the program presents to the user as a number of buttons. Upon selecting one of these buttons the program will notify the script where further events may occur.&lt;/p&gt;

Let's also say that there is a page called &lt;strong&gt;delete.php&lt;/strong&gt; which looks for the parameter &lt;strong&gt;post_id&lt;/strong&gt; and then deletes some entry from a database.&lt;/p&gt;

But hopefully this is one of the many cases where advances in the technology have rendered obsolete the way we're used to doing things.  Like "how do I wind my digital watch?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my understanding, the reason why ImageCodecInfo.GetImageDecoders() is necessary in System.Drawing has to do with the kludgy nature of System.Drawing itself: System.Drawing is a managed wrapper around GDI+, which is an unmanaged wrapper around a portion of the Win32 API.  So there might be a reason why a new codec would be installed in Windows without .NET inherently knowing about it.  And what's returned from GetImageDecoders() is just a bunch of strings that are typically passed back into System.Drawing/GDI+, and used to find and configure the appropriate DLL for reading/saving your image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, in WPF, the standard encoders and decoders are built into the framework, and, if I'm not mistaken, don't depend on anything that that isn't guaranteed to be installed as part of the framework.  The following classes inherit from BitmapEncoder and are available out-of-the-box with WPF: BmpBitmapEncoder, GifBitmapEncoder, JpegBitmapEncoder, PngBitmapEncoder, TiffBitmapEncoder, WmpBitmapEncoder.  There are BitmapDecoders for all the same formats, plus IconBitmapDecoder and LateBoundBitmapDecoder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be dealing with a case I'm not imagining, but it seems to me that if you're having to use a class that inherits from BitmapEncoder but wasn't included with WPF, it's probably your own custom class that you would install with your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps.  If I'm missing a necessary part of the picture, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

I'd like to give them a SQL-execution tool that helps them avoid common, easily-detected SQL mistakes that are easy to make when they are in a hurry. Can anyone suggest such a tool? Details follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the operations team remit is writing very complex ad-hoc SQL queries. Not surprisingly, operators sometimes make mistakes in the queries they write because they are so busy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, their queries are all SELECTs not data-changing SQL, and they are running on a copy of the database anyway. Still, we'd like to prevent errors in the SQL they run. For instance, sometimes the mistakes lead to long-running queries that slow down the duplicate system they're using and inconvenience others until we find the culprit query and kill it. Worse, occasionally the mistakes lead to apparently-correct answers that we don't catch until much later, with consequent embarrassment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our developers also make mistakes in complex code that they write, but they have Eclipse and various plugins (such as &lt;a href="http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow" title="FindBugs"&gt;FindBugs&lt;/a&gt;) that catch errors as they type. I'd like to give operators something similar - ideally it would see&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT U.NAME, C.NAME FROM USER U, COMPANY C WHERE U.NAME = 'ibell';
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and before you executed, it would say "Hey, did you realise that's a Cartesian product? Are you sure you want to do that?" It doesn't have to be very smart - finding obviously missing join conditions and similar evident errors would be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you put all your JS files into one directory, you can have your server-side environment (PHP for instance) loop through each file in that directory and output a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script src='/path/to/js/$file.js' type='text/javascript'&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in some header file that is included by all your UI pages. You'll find this auto-loading especially handy if you're regularly creating and removing JS files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your OS you may have more luck going straight to the hardware through normal channels as opposed to through openCV. If you are using Linux, video4linux or video4linux2 should give you relatively trivial access to USB webcams and you can use libavc1394 for firewire.

&lt;p&gt;As far as OOP goes, there isn't a single definition of object-orientedness so depending on who you ask you'll get a different set of hard and soft principles, patterns, and practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classic idea of OOP is that messages are sent to otherwise opaque objects and the objects interpret the message with knowledge of their own innards and then perform a function of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SRP is a software engineering principle that can apply to the role of a class, or a function, or a module. It contributes to the cohesion of something so that it behaves well put together without unrelated bits hanging off of it or having multiple roles that intertwine and complicate things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with just one responsibilty, that can still range from a single function to a group of loosely related functions that are part of a common theme. As long as you're avoiding jury-rigging an element to take the responsibilty of something it wasn't primarily designed for or doing some other ad-hoc thing that dilute the simplicity of an object, then violate whatever principle you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I find that it's easier to get SRP correct then to do something more elaborate that is just as robust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are very, very few valid reasons to use a label for breaking out of a loop. Breaking out is ok, but you can remove the need to break at all by modifying your design a little. In the example you have given, you would extract the 'Lots of code' sections and put them in individual methods with meaningful names. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for ( ;/*stuff*/; ) 
{
    lotsOfCode();

    if ( !isEnough() )

  &lt;p&gt;As others have said, it is possible.
  However, if both the service and
  client use an object that has the
  exact same domain behavior on both
  sides, you probably didn't need a
  service in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to disagree with this as it's a somewhat narrow comment. Using a webservice that can serialize domain objects to XML means that it makes it easy for clients that work with the same domain objects, but it also means that those clients are restricted to using that particular web service you've exposed and it also works in reverse by allowing other clients to have no knowledge of your domain objects but still interact with your service via XML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with most rules and laws, there are underlying motives by which these rules are relevant -- if the underlying motive is not present or applicable to your case, then you are free to bend/break the rules according to your own needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, SRP is not a rule of OOP per se, but are considered best practices to create OOP applications that are both easily extensible and unit-testable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Java is mainstream, and &lt;a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001002.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;many Java programmers&lt;/a&gt; have a bad reputation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Java lacks &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_programming" rel="nofollow"&gt;reflection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Java API is huge.  It's a case of design patterns gone wild, and that philosophy has seeped its way into most of the Java frameworks out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Java is fairly verbose
-- You need the class namespace for everything - you have to use static variables/methods instead of global variables/functions.
-- Things like ArrayLists/vectors are in the library but not baked into the language.
-- Encapsulation is taken to an extreme.  Using a private foo + getFoo() + setFoo(bar) is the same thing as using a public foo, right?  If you don't want somebody to setFoo, then it makes sense, but otherwise, no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Java isn't changing very quickly, even compared to C# (which now has type inference and closures)
-- Autoboxing/autounboxing came in very late.
-- The foreach loop came in very late.
-- Still no tuples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are invalid criticisms, like ones about speed and claims that all Java programmers are incompetent.  Criticism of static typing depends on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href="http://www.ohloh.net/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ohloh&lt;/a&gt;, Compare the number of lines of code for most Java projects and comparable projects written in higher level languages.  The use of interfaces and static typing over latent/dynamic typing and the general attitude that more code is good (or so it seems) can be quite frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java is getting old and it's much lower level than newer languages - which is usually bad.  Use it if you need speed or really well-tested, enterprise-quality frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is probably a soft-pitch question, but what is the proper method for documenting object relationships in Visio?  Is there a better template to use?  What stencil collection is the proper stencil in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my probably naive view I imagine an object being a large box with a single "reception" connector and containing multiple smaller boxes, each of which represents an object member and having its own connector.  So, each object member field would connect out to the "reception" connector on the object of the member's type.  In and of itself those objects are fairly easy to build.  The problem I ran into is that the connector lines didn't respect the objects and ran over the top of them, making an awful, unusable mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should translate your requirements into a Product Backlog. This backlog is what you use to decide what Sprint Backlog items are chosen for each Sprint iteration.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your Product Owner (usually a product manager) drives the creation of the stories. The Stories are simple (as a system admin, I need to be able to add a user). If your product management does not understand your product, you are in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agile is about designing as required. The design is never in the story. The spec can be per story, or per feature. You could design all your CRUD inside of one spec, which covers multiple stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Product Owner gets a product demo at the end of every Sprint. So value is demonstrated at every cycle. So your VP would get reports on a monthly basis (ususally 3 weeks of dev + 1 week to prepare for the Sprint demo).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Java is mainstream&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a valid criticism.  Things don't become bad just because they become mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Java lacks reflection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not true.  Java was the first mainstream language to have real reflection capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Java is getting old and it's much lower level than newer languages - which is usually bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java isn't low-level.  It's statically typed.  The two are not the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think most of the flak Java gets is because it's popular.  It certainly has problems, and there are certainly better languages, but Java gets way too much heat for its problems in comparison to the praise it gets for bringing object-oriented programming and garbage collection to the masses.&lt;/p&gt;

There, WeakReferences are used as a kind of light cache: it will keep your objects in memory only as long as your application does, allowing you to put a real cache on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another use would be in the implementation of weak event handlers. Currently, one big source of memory leaks in .NET applications is forgetting to remove event handlers. E.g.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public MyForm()
{
    MyApplication.Foo += someHandler;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the problem? In the above snippet, MyForm will be kept alive in memory forever as long as MyApplication is alive in memory. Create 10 MyForms, close them all, your 10 MyForms will still be in memory, kept alive by the event handler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter WeakReference. You can build a weak event handler using WeakReferences so that someHandler is a weak event handler to MyApplication.Foo, thus fixing your memory leaks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn't just theory. Dustin Campbell from the DidItWith.NET blog posted &lt;a href="http://diditwith.net/PermaLink,guid,aacdb8ae-7baa-4423-a953-c18c1c7940ab.aspx"&gt;an implementation of weak event handlers&lt;/a&gt; using System.WeakReference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would either place all of your DLL and application projects into the &lt;strong&gt;trunk&lt;/strong&gt; and then use &lt;strong&gt;branch&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;tags&lt;/strong&gt; for all of them as necessary too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;project1/
    branch/
    tags/
    trunk/

project2/
    branch/

&lt;p&gt;Note that this practice is simply convention and nothing in SVN requires (or really promotes) doing it exactly this way. However, everyone is used to it. So, you would be doing people a favor to go along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To elaborate further, the &lt;strong&gt;trunk&lt;/strong&gt; is where your main development will take place. When you want to mark a particular revision (e.g. a release version), then simply &lt;strong&gt;svn&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;copy&lt;/strong&gt; the project into the tags directory. Also, just copy code into the &lt;strong&gt;branch&lt;/strong&gt; directory when you want to do something dramatic or prolonged and don't want to hinder progress in the &lt;strong&gt;trunk&lt;/strong&gt;. Later you can &lt;strong&gt;svn&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;merge&lt;/strong&gt; your &lt;strong&gt;branch&lt;/strong&gt; back into the &lt;strong&gt;trunk&lt;/strong&gt; when it is ready for action!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to correct mishaps in your current Subverion repository, then just use &lt;strong&gt;svn&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;move&lt;/strong&gt; to relocate them. Unlike the delete and add process of &lt;a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/"&gt;CVS&lt;/a&gt;, move will retain version history for the new location.&lt;/p&gt;

And I'm not talking using .NET with a Mono or Wine virtual platform running beneath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our company has about 20 developers all running Windows XP/Vista and developing primarily for Linux &amp;amp; Solaris.  Until recently we all logged into a main Linux server and modified/built code the good old fashioned way: Emacs, Vi, dtpad - take your pick.  Then someone said, "hey - we're living in the Dark Ages, we should be using an IDE".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we tried out a few and decided that Visual Studio was the only one that would meet our performance needs (yes, I'm sure that IDE X is a very nice IDE, but we chose VS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is, how do you setup your environment to have the files available locally to VS, but also available to a build server?  We settled with writing a Visual Studio plugin - it writes our files locally and to the build server whenever we hit "Save" and we have a bit fat "sync" button that we can push when our files change on the server side (for when we update to the latest files from our source control server).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plugin also uses Visual Studio's external build system feature that ultimately just ssh's into the build server and calls our local "make" utility (which is Boost Build v2 - has great dependency checking, but is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; slow to start as a result i.e. 30-60 seconds to begin).  The results are piped back into Visual Studio so the developer can click on the error and be taken to the appropriate line of code (quite slick actually).  The build server uses GCC and cross-compiles all of our Solaris builds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even after we've done all this, I can't help but sigh whenever I start to write code in Visual Studio.  I click a file, start typing, and VS chugs to catch up with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only used C++ and Java as examples. The question has more to do with the overhead of having a lot of in-memory objects like you would in an application such as a word processor or even a game. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design patterns promote abstraction at the expense of parsimony even though they usually point out when you might take some kind of performance hit. Word processors and especially games get the most benefit from being as close to the metal as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the typical scenario here is that you have some class library called Common.Helpers that has code that is common to all your applications.&lt;/p&gt;

Even though they are signed they have plenty of spare bits (32 total) to treat as an unsigned byte. Also, all of the mathematical operators will convert smaller fixed precision numbers to &lt;strong&gt;int&lt;/strong&gt;. Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;short a = 1s;
short b = 2s;
int c = a + b; // the result is up-converted
short small = (short)c; // must cast to get it back to short
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this it is best to just stick with integer and mask it to get the bits that you are interested in. Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int a = 32;
int b = 128;
int foo = (a + b) | 255;

I'm not terribly concerned with Objective C syntax/constructs/bheaviors at this point, but more curious as to an efficient setup on in terms of an editor and/or IDE that will get me going quickly.  Is there any IDE even remotely similar to Visual Studio (since that's where I've spent most of my time over the last 7 years) in terms of it's solution/project concept?  Any other tools, tips, suggestions and/or resources to get up and experimenting quickly?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd like to avoid a lot of the intro stuff and get into things like "If you want to create an Mac desktop application, you can use &lt;i&gt;Acme IDE&lt;/i&gt; and set up your project like this." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was afraid Xcode was going to be the answer! :P  I tried playing around with that -- literally just getting it off the DVD and just diving in with no idea what to expect (before I even knew that you used Objective C as the language).  I figured, the wise guy that I am, that I could just sort of fumble around and get a simple app working ... wrong.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Andrew - Thanks for the insight on those config settings.  Based on my Xcode first impression, I think those may help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With version control, especially Subversion, you can easily check out pieces of a repository into another working copy and then commit them back to their respective repositories.  That allows you to keep them clearly separate and distinct while giving you a great deal of flexibility. Once you get into SVN a little more (I'm assuming you are new.) you can start using hooks and I might see where that could get difficult with you setup.  If permission are important to you, a single repository might prove more difficult than necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you are concerned that it will take a lot of time to setup each repository look into the SVNParentPath variable for the Apache configuration file. (Again, I'm assuming you are using Apache.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Windows XP SP2+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Windows Server 2003&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://blogs.windowsclient.net/trickster92/archive/2008/05/21/introducing-the-net-framework-client-profile.aspx"&gt;Appears&lt;/a&gt; the Client Profile will not install on Windows Server 2003.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the client profile is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; valid for x64 or ia64 editions; and will also not install if &lt;em&gt;any previous version of the .NET Framework has been installed&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering if the effort in adding the extra OS configurations to the testing matrix is worth the effort. Is there any metrics available that state the percentage of users that could possibly benefit from the client profile? I believe that once the .NET Framework has been installed, extra information is passed to a web server as part of a web request signifying that the framework is available. Granted, I would imagine that Windows XP SP2 users without the .NET Framework installed would be a large amount of people. It would then be a question of whether my application targeted those individuals specifically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else determined if it is worth the extra effort to target these specific users?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit: It seems that it is possible to get a compiler warning if you use features not included in the Client Profile. As I usually run with warnings as errors, this will hopefully be enough to minimise testing in this configuration.&lt;/strong&gt; Of course, this configuration will still need to be tested, but it should be as simple as testing if the install/initial run works on XP with SP2+.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find the debugger has some annoying issues such as breakpoints not correctly mapping to lines and exceptions aren't immediately trapped by the debugger. Nothing deal-breaking but a bit cumbersome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would recommend that you make use of the new property syntax that was introduced for Objective-C 2.0. They make for a heck of a lot less typing in many many places. They're limited to OSX 10.5 only though (yeah, language features are tied to OS versions which is a bit odd). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also don't be fooled into downplaying the differences between C/C++ and Objective-C. They're very much related but ARE different languages. Try and start Objective-C without thinking about how you'd do X,Y,Z in C/C++. It'll make it a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;

Looking at the first slew of answers, I couldn't disagree more.

Database design is typically the first step for Microsoft folks (which I do daily, but am in a recovery program, er, Alt.Net).

  &lt;p&gt;lets you call standard C functions and C++ methods with no need for proxy functions. The application simply registers the functions, objects, and methods that the scripts should be able to work with and nothing more has to be done with your code. The same functions used by the application internally can also be used by the scripting engine, which eliminates the need to duplicate functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;For the script writer the scripting language follows the widely known syntax of C/C++ (with minor changes), but without the need to worry about pointers and memory leaks. &lt;/p&gt;

If you have the budget, the Mac Pro with Bootcamp(or a vm if you are so inclinded) might be a consideration.  You won't want to upgrade your HDD or memory from Apple, but, the parts are easy enough to find at Newegg.

If this is what you are trying to do here, then yes, it is correct - you have two documents (or document fragments). To make it more explicit, you should separate them with three dashes, like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;---
heading:
 name: A name
 taco: Yes
 age: 32
---
heading:
 name: Another name
 taco: No
 age: 27
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand if you wish to make them part of the same document (so that deserializing them would result in a list with two elements), you should write it like the following. Take extra care with the indentation level:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- heading:
  name: A name
  taco: Yes
  age: 32
- heading:
  name: Another name
  taco: No
  age: 27

&lt;p&gt;In general YAML is concise and human readable / editable, but not really human writable, so you should always use libraries to generate it. Also, take care that there exists some breaking changes between different versions of YAML, which can bite you if you are using libraries in different languages which conform to different versions of the standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In regards to Xcode vs Visual Studio - they are different. I wouldn't say one is better than the other - Windows developers come over from VS and expect it to be the same. This is just an arrogant attitude and please don't fall into this crowd. Having used VS since the AppStudio days and Xcode for a year or so now, both have strengths and weaknesses. Xcode is something that out of the box (and especially when coming from VS) doesn't seem that good, but once you start using and understanding it - it becomes very powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, there are a lot more tools included with Xcode et al, such as Instruments and Shark that you simply can't get with VS, unless you open your wallet, and even then IMHO aren't as good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, good luck. I still enjoy C#, but Objective-C/Cocoa somehow makes programming fun again once you get into it...&lt;/p&gt;

This is because the client profile is a subset of the .net framework v3.5 sp1, and if v3.5 sp1 is already installed you don't need to install anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assemblies in the client profile are the same binaries as the full framework, so unless you're loading assemblies dynamically, then you shouldn't need to do any additional testing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thinking is that unless you must use assemblies which are NOT in the client profile, then you should target it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the OS requirements, WPF won't run on pre-XP sp2, so if you need to run on other OSes, then you'll have to use WinForms anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;On IE, yes. It sends the .NET Framework version as part of the UA string, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First read the spec like a story (skimming through it). Don't stop at every requirement to analyze it right there and then. This will allow you to get an overall picture of the system without too many details. At this point you would start identifying the major functional components of the system. Start putting these down (use a mindmap tool if you like).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then take each component and start exploding it (and tying each detail with requirements in the spec document). Do this for all components, till you have covered all requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, you should start looking at relationships between the components, and whether there are repetitions of features or functions across the various components (which you can then pull out to create utility components, or such). Around now, you would have a good detailed map of your requirements in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOW, you should think of designing the database, ER diagrams, Class Design, DFDs, deployment, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with doing the last step first is that you can get bogged down in the complexity of your system without really gaining an overall understanding in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

If your "plugin" projects are assemblies (and not just project-references from the main project), then you do not need to rebuild the main project each time a plugin is rebuilt.  The new assembly will get selected into the process / debugger w/o the main project needing a rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;

Specifically, our product makes use of another product (lets call it X) that it launches whenever it needs its services. The actual problem is that whenever X is launched immediately after log-on, it crashes or reports critical errors related to disk access (this happens even when X is launched directly - not through our product).&lt;/p&gt;

When we changed the delay to 70 seconds, all is well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tried to reproduce the problem by launching our product manually immediately after logon (by double-clicking on a shortcut placed on the desktop) but to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;

Windows has several mechanisms that allow the user/admin to set up applications to automatically run when windows starts. This feature is mostly used for one of these purposes:
1. Programs that are part of the basic work environment of the user, such that the first action the user would usually take when starting the computer is to start them.
2. All sorts of background "agents" - skype, messenger, winamp etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When too many (or too heavy) programs are registered to run on startup the end result is that the user can't actually do anything for the first few seconds/minutes after login, which can be really annoying. In comes Vista's "Boxing" feature:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Briefly, Vista forces all programs invoked through the Run key to operate at low priority for the first 60 seconds after login. This affects both &lt;strong&gt;I/O priority (which is set to Very Low) and CPU priority&lt;/strong&gt;. Very Low priority I/O requests do not pass through the file cache, but go directly to disk. Thus, they are much slower than regular I/O. 
The length of the boxing period is set by the registry value: 
"HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced\DelayedApps\Delay_Sec". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you perform a translation, reset the clip so at this point I assume the clientRectangle is being used as the appropriate clip region and then attempt to redarw the translated spike. Where's the bug?!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, the control will simply revert to its default state each and every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always keep in the back of your mind that the Page (and its contents) and the code are completely seperate in ASP.NET, they are hooked up at run time.

&lt;li&gt;It seems that checking rows at anotherConditionAtVector is redundant since whatever the value of idx is, anotherConditionAtVector only depends on the row index (assuming anotherConditionAtVector has no side effects). &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Get the valid positions first using conditionAtVectorPosition (these are the valid columns).&lt;/li&gt;

The most likely people to do this are the ones doing the worst jobs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's reams of info out in the internet on this subject, but the first step is to ask yourself why you need this information. Is it to give you an idea of project end dates or is it to rate or rank developers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the latter - Good luck with that - Any metric you create will be too simple &amp;amp; too esasily gamed. These metrics will also fail to measure how good a job a developer is doing. That'll foster bad feeling amongst developers and it'll be counterproductive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're trying to get an idea of how long a job is going to take... Here's what I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Split a job into manageable tasks. Each task should take no longer than three hours. Each task should be defined in terms of the number of minutes it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; take to complete. If a task takes more than three hours, you need to split it into subtasks. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Round all minutes up to the nearest 15 minute increment. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add all the minutes from everyone together. (This step is important)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divide by 60 to give a total number of hours. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Double it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I give myself 5 working hours in a day - doesn't sound like a lot, but you'll be amazed at how many interruptions there are in a normal day. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, this usually works out about right. Once you've got the value above, you can multiply it by a factor calculated from the last three projects to allow for team bias (too optimistic / too pessimistic). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On developer performance. I don't really understand why you're concerned about developer performance. There's no need for you to be trying to highlight bad developers using the power of math. If you think someone is swinging the lead, bring it up with your manager and leave it at that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the management does nothing about it and it's harming your health / job / career, then it's time for you to move on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There should be a designated user representative. Or more than one, if domain knowledge can't be concentrated in one individual. But someone from the business domain should be in charge overall of deciding what goes into a sprint, subject to the effort available, of course. There can be a place for a Business Analyst type, but they need to be domain experts. If your user(s) can't write stories, even with your help (it's a co-operative thing, or should be) then you all need help. Consider getting a coach involved for a sprint or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You won't be writing functional specs in an Agile environment. You'll be writing code. Your user will be on hand at all times (or you're already exposed to significant risk) and they're your spec. The story tells you "what", and is going to be a small enough unit of work that you should be able to decide on "how" fairly quickly. And refactor. Always refactor. It's not an overhead, it's part of the process and your design won't evolve satisfactorily without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have VPs (hey, I'm a VP, we're not all bad!) who ask that sort of question, then parts of your company are not getting it yet. Choose someone (the person best able to deal with non-techies, perhaps, or maybe the person least able, since they clearly need the practice) to explain it to them. If what's built is important to them, perhaps their questions are an indication that someone's not as involved as they should be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One problem with database triggers is that it leaves you no choice but to use Integrated Security coupled with ActiveDirectory as access to your SQL Server. The reason for that is that your connection should inherit the identity of the user who triggered the connection; if your application uses a named "sa" account or other user accounts, the "user" field will only reflect "sa".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be overriden by creating a named SQL Server account for each and every user of the application, but this will be impractical for non-intranet, public facing web applications, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They all look less readable than the original, in that they involve spending more code on the mechanism of the code rather than on the algorithm itself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of them are broken, or were before they were edited. Most damning is the fact that people are having to think quite hard about how to write the code without labels and not break anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some come with a performance penalty of running the same test twice, which may not always be trivial. The alternative to that is storing and passing round booleans, which gets ugly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refactoring the relevant part of the code into a method is effectively a no-op: it rearranges how the code is laid out in the file, but has no effect on how it's executed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of which makes me believe that, at least in the case of this question as phrased, the label is the correct solution and doesn't need to be refactored away. Certainly there are cases where labels are used incorrectly and should be refactored away. I just don't think it should be treated as some unbreakable rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ATM I have no experience of Rails, but it might be a pretty good place to start as it includes a lot of stuff that you'd have to figure out early on otherwise (integration with a Scriptaculous, a JS framework) - you can always learn what going on under the hood at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.NET is always an option, and if you're comfortable with Visual Studio it may be the way to go, but it's not the easiest thing to pick up otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know a bit of HTML but are basically new to server-side programming you might look at ColdFusion. It's actually extremely powerful and like Rails includes lots of "out of the box" benefits. There's a Swiss company called &lt;a href="http://www.railo.ch" rel="nofollow"&gt;Railo&lt;/a&gt; who are currently in the process of releasing an Open Source ColdFusion engine that is affiliated with JBoss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.3.4, section 12 talks about the array allocation overhead and, unless I'm misreading it, it seems to suggest to me that it is valid for the compiler to add it on placement new as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This overhead may be applied in all array new-expressions, including those referencing the library function operator new[](std::size_t, void*) and other placement allocation functions. The amount of overhead may vary from one invocation of new to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More Visual Studio tips and tricks than you can shake a stick at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some others:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Visual Studio 2005 and 2008 3-month trial editions are fully-functional, and can be &lt;a href="http://www.codingthewheel.com/archives/microsoft-vs-the-system-clock" rel="nofollow"&gt;used indefinitely&lt;/a&gt; (forever) by setting the system clock back prior to opening VS. Then, when VS is opened, set the system clock forward again so your datetimes aren't screwed up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But that's really piracy and I can't recommend it, especially when anybody with a .edu address can get a fully-functional Pro version of VS2008 through &lt;a href="https://downloads.channel8.msdn.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Microsoft Dreamspark&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can use Visual Studio to open 3rd-party executables, and browse embedded resources (dialogs, string tables, images, etc) stored within.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debugging visualizers are not exactly a "hidden" feature but they are somewhat neglected, and super-useful, since in addition to using the provided visualizers you can &lt;a href="http://nayyeri.net/blog/how-to-write-a-visual-studio-visualizer/" rel="nofollow"&gt;roll your own&lt;/a&gt; for specific data sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debugger's "Set Instruction Pointer" or "Set Next Statement" command.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conditional breakpoints (as KiwiBastard noted).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can use Quickwatch etc. to evaluate not only the value of a variable, but runtime expressions around that variable.&lt;/li&gt;

Three years later, developers were fleeing the company and we were still X months away from actually selling anything.&lt;/p&gt;

If people need to be added to the project, then it should be done near the start rather than after stuff starts going wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think very carefully about what the product is for, and to boil it down to the &lt;strong&gt;simplest&lt;/strong&gt; set of requirements you can think of. If the people giving you the spec aren't technical, try to see past what they've written to what will actually work and make money. Talk to customers and salespeople, and understand the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no shame in admitting you're wrong. If it turns out that the entire system needs to be rewritten, because you made some mistake in your first version, then it's better to admit this as soon as possible so you can get to it. Correspondingly, don't try to make an architecture that can anticipate every possible contingency in your first version, because you don't know what every contingency is and will just get it wrong. Write once with an eye to throwing away and starting again - you may not have to, the first version may be fine, but admit it if you do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many of those people actually use Java on a regular basis and know the language well enough to make justified criticism of it? Since you are saying they never mention any specific disadvantages, but simply have a "Java is bad" attitude, I suspect these people are not the right crowd to listen to when it comes to the quality of Java as a programming language and development tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to find out what is wrong with Java is to learn it and use it yourself. Only then can you make up your own opinion. Java, as every other programming language ever invented, has its advantages and disadvantages. Which of those matter to you is highly dependent on what you intend to use the language for. It's all about choosing the right tool for the right job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to be a programmer, learn Java, but also learn C# and Ruby, Python, PHP or Perl. The more languages you know, the better equipped you will be to use the best language for a given task.&lt;/p&gt;

We were then able to return the appropriate types back to the client applications without a significant amount of re-factoring work.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://xstream.codehaus.org/tutorial.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;XStream&lt;/a&gt; makes this really easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you would define the main object, which in your case is CustomData (I'm using public fields to keep the example simple):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class CustomData {
  public String tag1;
  public String tag2;
  public String location;
  public String tag3;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you initialize XStream:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;XStream xstream = new XStream();
// if you need to output the main tag in lowercase, use the following line
xstream.alias("customdata", CustomData.class);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can construct an object from XML, set the location field on the object and regenerate the XML:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CustomData d = (CustomData)xstream.fromXML(xml);
d.location = "http://stackoverflow.com";
xml = xstream.toXML(d);

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They all look less readable than the original, in that they involve spending more code on the mechanism of the code rather than on the algorithm itself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Externalizing the second loop outside the algorithm is not necessarily less readable. If the method name is well chosen, it can improve readability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some of them are broken, or were before they were edited. Most damning is the fact that people are having to think quite hard about how to write the code without labels and not break anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a different point of view: some of them are broken because it is hard to figure out the behavior of the original algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some come with a performance penalty of running the same test twice, which may not always be trivial. The alternative to that is storing and passing round booleans, which gets ugly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performance penalty is minor. However I agree that running a test twice is not a nice solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Refactoring the relevant part of the code into a method is effectively a no-op: it rearranges how the code is laid out in the file, but has no effect on how it's executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't see the point. Yep, it doesn't change the behavior, like... refactoring?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Certainly there are cases where labels are used incorrectly and should be refactored away. I just don't think it should be treated as some unbreakable rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I totally agree. But as you have pointed out, some of us have difficulties while refactoring this example. Even if the initial example is readable, it is hard to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Some of them are broken, or were before they were edited. Most damning is the fact that 
    people are having to think quite hard about how to write the code without labels and not 
    break anything.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I have a different point of view: some of them are broken because it is hard to figure out 
  the behavior of the original algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realise that it's subjective, but I don't have any trouble reading the original algorithm. It's shorter and clearer than the proposed replacements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What all the refactorings in this thread do is emulate the behaviour of a label using other language features - as if you were porting the code to a language that didn't have labels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your xml document is available to you as an org.w3c.dom.Document object (as most parsers return), then you could do something like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// get the list of customdata nodes
NodeList customDataNodeSet = findNodes(document, "//customdata" );

for (int i=0 ; i &amp;lt; customDataNodeSet.getLength() ; i++) {
  Node customDataNode = customDataNodeSet.item( i );

  // get the location nodes (if any) within this one customdata node
  NodeList locationNodeSet = findNodes(customDataNode, "location" );

  if (locationNodeSet.getLength() &amp;gt; 0) {
    // replace
    locationNodeSet.item( 0 ).setTextContent( "http://stackoverflow.com/" );
  }
  else {
    // insert
    Element newLocationNode = document.createElement( "location" );
    newLocationNode.setTextContent("http://stackoverflow.com/" );
    customDataNode.appendChild( newLocationNode );

Some explanation: take the physical path of the current page, split it into two parts: server and directory (like c:\inetpub\whatever.com\whatever) and page name (like /Whatever.aspx). The image's physical path should contain the server's path, so "substract" them, leaving only the image's path relative to the server's (like: \design\picture.jpg). Replace the backslashes with slashes and append it to the server's url.&lt;/p&gt;

The alternative to that is storing and passing round booleans, which gets ugly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performance penalty is minor. However I agree that running a test twice is not a nice solution.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the question was how to remove the labels, not how to optimize the algorithm. It appeared to me that the original poster was unaware of how to use 'continue' and 'break' keywords without labels, but of course, my assumptions may be wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to performance, the post does not give any information about the implementation of the other functions, so for all I know they might as well be downloading the results via FTP as consisting of simple calculations inlined by the compiler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, doing the same test twice is not optimal&amp;mdash;in theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: On a second thought, the example is actually not a horrible use of labels. I agree that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto#Criticism_of_goto_usage" rel="nofollow"&gt;"goto is a no-no"&lt;/a&gt;, but not because of code like this. The use of labels here does not actually affect the readability of the code in a significant way. Of course, they are not required and can easily be omitted, but not using them simply because "using labels is bad" is not a good argument in this case. After all, removing the labels does not make the code much easier to read, as others have already commented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IInterceptor is the recommended way to modify any data in nhibernate in a non-invasive fashion.  It's also useful for decryption / encryption of data without your application code needing to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Triggers on the database are moving the responsibility of logging (an application concern) in to the DBMS layer which effectively ties your logging solution to your database platform.  By encapsulating the auditing mechanics in the persistance layer you retain platform independance and code transportability.&lt;/p&gt;

I know Python fairly well and plan on implementing everything in Python to begin with but envisage that I may have to re-implement some core routines in a compiled language eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IIRC, one of Python's original remits was as a prototyping language, however Python is pretty liberal in allowing functions, functors, objects to be passed to functions and methods, whereas I suspect the same is not true of say C or Fortran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should I know about designing functions/classes which I envisage will have to interface into the compiled language? And how much of these potential problems are dealt with by libraries such as cTypes, bgen, &lt;a href="http://www.swig.org/"&gt;SWIG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_35_0/libs/python/doc/index.html"&gt;Boost.Python&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://cython.org/"&gt;Cython&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/sip/intro"&gt;Python SIP&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this particular use case, (a fitting library) I imagine allowing users to define mathematical functions (Guassian, Lorentzian etc.) as Python functions which can then to be passed an interpreted by the compiled code fitting library. Passing and returning arrays is also essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been using Eclipse/Aptana/RadRails and unlike Gaius have been pretty happy with it.
I recommend the Eclipse IDE for Java Developers from Eclipse Downloads: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then grab Aptana Studio, following these &lt;a href="http://www.aptana.com/docs/index.php/Plugging_Aptana_into_an_existing_Eclipse_configuration#Eclipse_3.4_Instructions" rel="nofollow"&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if you wants to define another style just give it another name like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Style x:Key=buttonStyleBlue&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;Setter Property=Button.FontSize Value=22/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;Setter Property=Button.Background Value=Blue/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;Setter Property=Button.Width Value=50/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;Setter Property=Button.RenderTransformOrigin Value=.5,.5/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;Setter Property=Button.RenderTransform&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;Setter.Value&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;RotateTransform Angle=10/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/Setter.Value&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/Setter&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then apply it with the x:Key you defined it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To extend on Greg's answer...
Just to clarify, you cannot add a user control to the tool box if the code for it is in the same project that you want to use it in.  For some reason MS has never added this ability, which would make sense since we don't want to always have to create a User Control Library DLL everytime we want to use a user control.  So, to get it in your tool box, you have to first create a separate "User Control Library" project (which &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be in the same solution!) and then do what Greg said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm probably doing something wrong, but here is what I have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;interface iVendor{
    public function __construct($vendors_no = null);
    public function getName();
    public function getVendors_no();
    public function getZip();
    public function getCountryCode();
    public function setName($name);
    public function setVendors_no($vendors_no);
    public function setZip($zip);
    public function setCountryCode($countryCode);
}

interface iShipper extends iVendor{
    public function __construct($vendors_no = null, $shipment = null);
    public function getTransitTime($shipment = null);
    public function getTransitCost($shipment = null);
    public function getCurrentShipment();
    public function setCurrentShipment($shipment);
    public function getStatus($shipment = null);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally in PHP, when you extend something, you can overwrite any method contained therein (right?). However, when one interface extends another, it won't let you. Unless I'm thinking about this wrong... When I implement the iShipper interface, I don't have to make the Shipper object extend the Vendor object (that implements the iVendor interface). I just say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class FedEx implements iShipper{}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and make FedEx implement all of the methods from iVendor and iShipper. However, I need the __construct functions in iVendor and iShipper to be unique. I know I could take out the $shipment = null, but then it wouldn't be as convenient to create Shippers (by just passing in the vendors_no and the shipment while instantiating).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone know how to make this work? My fallback is to have to set the shipment by calling $shipper-&gt;setShipment($shipment); on the Shipper after I instantiate it, but I'm hoping for a way to get around having to do that...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A little more explanation for the curious:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The FedEx Object has methods that go to the FedEx site (using cURL) and gets an estimate for the Shipment in question. I have a UPS Object, a BAXGlobal Object, a Conway Object, etc. Each one has COMPLETELY different methods for actually getting the shipping estimate, but all the system needs to know is that they are a "shipper" and that the methods listed in the interface are callable on them (so it can treat them all exactly the same, and loop through them in a "shippers" array calling getTransitX() to find the best shipper for a shipment).&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each "Shipper" is also a "Vendor" though, and is treated as such in other parts of the system (getting and putting in the DB, etc. Our data design is a pile of crap, so FedEx is stored right alongside companies like Dunder Mifflin in the "Vendors" table, which means it gets to have all the properties of every other Vendor, but needs the extra properties and methods supplied by iShipper).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, a branch is a way to work on changes to the code without affecting trunk.  Say you want to add a new feature that's fairly complicated.  You want to be able to check in changes as you make them, but don't want it to affect trunk until you're done with the feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First you'd create a branch.  This is basically a copy of trunk as-of the time you made the branch.  You'd then do all your work in the branch.  Any changes made in the branch don't affect trunk, so trunk is still usable, allowing others to continue working there (like doing bugfixes or small enhancements).  Once your feature is done you'd integrate the branch back into trunk.  This would move all your changes from the branch to trunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of patterns people use for branches.  If you have a product with multiple major versions being supported at once, usually each version would be a branch.  Where I work we have a QA branch and a Production branch.  Before releasing our code to QA we integrate changes to the QA branch, then deploy from there.  When releasing to production we integrate from the QA branch to the Production branch, so we know the code running in production is identical to what QA tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branching_%28software%29" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wikipedia entry on branches&lt;/a&gt;, since they probably explain things better than I can. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;branches&lt;/strong&gt; are usually used to do something away from the trunk (or other development line) that would otherwise &lt;em&gt;break&lt;/em&gt; the build. New features are often built in a branch and then merged back into the trunk. Branches often contain code that are not necessarily approved for the development line it branched from. For example, a programmer could try an optimization on something in a branch and only merge back in the development line once the optimization is satisfactory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second easiest way is to write a Python module in C and then call functions in that module.  You can pass anything you want to these C functions without having to jump through any hoops.  And it's easy to call Python functions or methods from these C functions, as described here: &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/extending/extending.html#calling-python-functions-from-c" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://docs.python.org/extending/extending.html#calling-python-functions-from-c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't have enough experience with SWIG to offer intelligent commentary.  And while it is possible to do things like pass custom Python objects to C functions through ctypes, or to define new Python classes in C, these things are annoying and verbose and I recommend taking one of the two approaches described above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to answer the original question, I personally try to avoid using reduce because it's never really necessary and I find it to be less clear than other approaches.  However, some people get used to reduce and come to prefer it to list comprehensions (especially Haskell programmers).  But if you're not already thinking about a problem in terms of reduce, you probably don't need to worry about using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IDE-in-a-browser (which is itself build with GI) actually works surprisingly well, though there are some features you normally expect from an editor that it lacks, most notably (and irritatingly) an Undo command. It's also impossible to do things like subdocument includes (practically a necessity for team development) from the IDE, though you can do them manually in the underlying XML and the IDE will respect them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end the main reason we didn't go with it was that it was difficult to make the resulting web application look as good as the designers really wanted. It was relatively easy to build functionality, but the components were very restrictive in look and feel. The way GI renders its own document model to HTML involves a lot of &lt;code&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; attributes which makes skinning in CSS all but impossible. It seems to prefer making web applications that look like applications, instead of web applications that look like websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it would probably be great for building intranet type applications where look and feel isn't a huge issue, but I probably wouldn't use it to make a public facing site.&lt;/p&gt;

This allows you to both extend interfaces and also have a class that implements multiple interfaces (both allowed, and very useful in many cases) without worrying about having to satisfy a particular constructor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EDIT:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here's my new model:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A. Each interface no longer has a constructor method.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;B. All Shippers (UPS, FedEx, etc) now implement iShipper (which extends iVendor) and extend the abstract class Shipper (which has all common non-abstract methods for shippers defined in it, getName(), getZip() etc).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;C. Each Shipper has it's own unique _construct method which overwrites the abstract __construct($vendors_no = null, $shipment = null) method contained in Shipper (I don't remember why I'm allowing those to be optional now though. I'd have to go back through my documentation...).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;interface iVendor{
    public function getName();
    public function getVendors_no();
    public function getZip();
    public function getCountryCode();
    public function setName($name);
    public function setVendors_no($vendors_no);
    public function setZip($zip);
    public function setCountryCode($countryCode);
}

interface iShipper extends iVendor{
    public function getTransitTime($shipment = null);
    public function getTransitCost($shipment = null);
    public function getCurrentShipment();
    public function setCurrentShipment($shipment);
    public function getStatus($shipment = null);
}

abstract class Shipper implements iShipper{  
    abstract public function __construct($vendors_no = null, $shipment = null);  
    //a bunch of non-abstract common methods...  
}

class FedEx extends Shipper implements iShipper{  
    public function __construct($vendors_no = null, $shipment = null){
        //a bunch of setup code...
    }
    //all my FedEx specific methods...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks for the help!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A DBA has no freedom to make changes
  to the data model without forcing you
  to change your compiled code. With
  stored procedures, you can hide these
  sorts of changes to an extent, since
  the parameter list and results set(s)
  returned from a procedure represent
  its contract, and the innards can be
  changed around, just so long as that
  contract is still met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really don't see this as being a benefit. Being able to change something in isolation might sound good in theory, but just because the changes fulfil a contract doesn't mean it's returning the correct results. To be able to determine what the correct results are you need context and you get that context from the calling code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, use a Makefile driven process and the command line tool svnversion. (Language specific - this should work for C/C++)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo -n "#define VERSION 1.0.1-" &amp;gt; version.h
svnversion -n . &amp;gt;&amp;gt; version.h

&lt;p&gt;Or some more complex build script with sed and version.h.in. Then just &lt;em&gt;#include version.h&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

There also seems to be some interface ties between Google's own web-based Google Analytics and Urchin.  It's not free though, unfortunately, and I think you can only get it through authorized partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does all the standard logfile analysis stuff, everything is browser-based, the reports it offers are pretty deep and comprehensive, and it also seems to have a few bells and whistles that other services don't offer.

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I've asked a lot about on this site is &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa904594.aspx"&gt;LINQ&lt;/a&gt;. The questions I've asked have been wide and varied and often don't have much context behind them. So in an attempt to consolidate the knowledge I've acquired on Linq I'm posting this question with a view to maintaining and updating it with additional information as I continue to learn about LINQ. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also hope that it will prove to be a useful resource for other people wanting to learn about LINQ. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is LINQ?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa904594.aspx"&gt;MSDN&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The LINQ Project is a codename for a
  set of extensions to the .NET
  Framework that encompass
  language-integrated query, set, and
  transform operations. It extends C#
  and Visual Basic with native language
  syntax for queries and provides class
  libraries to take advantage of these
  capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means is that LINQ provides a standard way to query a variety of datasources using a common syntax. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What flavours of LINQ are there?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently there are a few different LINQ providers provided by Microsoft:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397919.aspx"&gt;Linq to Objects&lt;/a&gt; which allows you to execute queries on any IEnumerable object.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb425822.aspx"&gt;Linq to SQL&lt;/a&gt; which allows you to execute queries against a database in an object oriented manner.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb387098.aspx"&gt;Linq to XML&lt;/a&gt; which allows you to query, load, validate, serialize and manipulate XML documents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386964.aspx"&gt;Linq to Entities&lt;/a&gt; as suggested by &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16322/all-about-linq#33588"&gt;Andrei&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb399399.aspx"&gt;Linq to Dataset&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few others, many of which are listed &lt;a href="http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/vardi/archive/2008/10/09/the-linq-list-projects.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What are the benefits?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standardized way to query multiple datasources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compile time safety of queries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimized way to perform set based operations on in memory objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to debug queries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;So what can I do with LINQ?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/489/ch00k"&gt;Chook&lt;/a&gt; provides a way to &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4432/csv-string-handling#4441"&gt;output CSV files&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A summary of links from &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8050/beginners-guide-to-linq"&gt;GateKiller's question&lt;/a&gt; are below&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
Scott Guthrie provides an &lt;a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/05/19/using-linq-to-sql-part-1.aspx"&gt;intro to Linq on his blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What do I need to use LINQ?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linq is currently available in VB.Net 9.0 and C# 3.0 so you'll need Visual Studio 2008 or greater to get the full benefits. (You could always write your code in notepad and compile using MSBuild)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a tool called &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7652/querying-like-linq-when-you-dont-have-linq#7710"&gt;LinqBridge&lt;/a&gt; which will allow you to run Linq like queries in C# 2.0. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;dp: You are right that I missed a check in Equals, I have updated it.  Using the existing hashcode from the byte array will result in reference equality (or at least that same concept translated to hashcodes).
for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;byte[] b1 = new byte[] { 1 };
byte[] b2 = new byte[] { 1 };
int h1 = b1.GetHashCode();
int h2 = b2.GetHashCode();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that code, despite the two byte arrays having the same values within them, they are referring to different parts of memory and will result in (probably) different hash codes.  I need the hash codes for two byte arrays with the same contents to be equal.&lt;/p&gt;

If you use an instance to access the DB layer, you are allowing multiple versions of that class to exist. This is desirable if you want to use the same DB layer to access multiple databases for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you might have something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;DbController acrhive = new DbController("dev");
DbController prod = new DbController("prod");
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which allows you to use multiple instances of the same class to access different databases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely you might want to allow only one database to be used within your application at a time. If you want to do this then you could look at using a static class for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

ORM (Object Relational Model) or Interface Model.  ORM is very popular right now because of frameworks like nhibernate, LINQ to SQL, Entity Framework, and many others.  The ORM lets you customize some business constraints around your object model and pass it around with out actually knowing how it should be committed to the database.  Everything related to inserting, updating, and deleting happens in the object and doesn't really have to worry the developer too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Interface Model like the Enterprise Data Pattern made popular by Microsoft, requires you to know what state your object is in and how it should be handled.  It also requires you to create the necessary SQL to perform the actions.&lt;/p&gt;

In my experience, the one-object-to-one-row approach creates a much more fluid and literate presentation in code.  Also, I like to treat objects as records and the class as the table.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;objPerson = new Person(id)

objPerson.name = "George"

objPerson.save()

&lt;p&gt;The checking rule is: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hash codes are equal? Then call the full (slow) &lt;code&gt;Equals&lt;/code&gt; method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hash codes are not equal? Then the two items are definitely not equal.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you want is a &lt;code&gt;GetHashCode&lt;/code&gt; algorithm that splits up your collection into roughly even groups - it shouldn't form the key as the &lt;code&gt;HashTable&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Dictionary&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will need to use the hash to optimise retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long do you expect the data to be? How random?  If lengths vary greatly (say for files) then just return the length.  If lengths are likely to be similar look at a subset of the bytes that varies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;GetHashCode&lt;/code&gt; should be a lot quicker than &lt;code&gt;Equals&lt;/code&gt;, but doesn't need to be unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two identical things &lt;em&gt;must never&lt;/em&gt; have different hash codes. Two different objects &lt;em&gt;should not&lt;/em&gt; have the same hash code, but some collisions are to be expected (after all, there are more permutations than possible 32 bit integers).&lt;/p&gt;

In such scenario it might not be desirable to have multiple instances of ASP.NET Development Server running...  VS provides an explicit setting in the property grid of web application/site called Development Web Server - "Always Start When Debugging" which is set to True by default...  If you set this Property to be False only one web server instance will be created for the start up web project...&lt;/p&gt;

Remember, you're basically representing n bytes of data with m bits of information.  The larger your data set and the smaller m is, the more likely you'll get a collision ... two pieces of data resolving to the same hash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplest hash I ever learned was simply XORing all the bytes together.  It's easy, faster than most complicated hash algorithms and a halfway decent general-purpose hash algorithm for small data sets.  It's the Bubble Sort of hash algorithms really.  Since the simple implementation would leave you with 8 bits, that's only 256 hashes ... not so hot.  You could XOR chunks instead of individal bytes, but then the algorithm gets much more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So certainly, the cryptographic algorithms are maybe doing some stuff you don't need ... but they're also a huge step up in general-purpose hash quality.  The MD5 hash you're using has 128 bits, with billions and billions of possible hashes.  The only way you're likely to get something better is to take some representative samples of the data you expect to be going through your application and try various algorithms on it to see how many collisions you get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So until I see some reason to not use a canned hash algorithm (performance, perhaps?), I'm going to have to recommend you stick with what you've got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My general answer is a series of Regular Expressions, though the complexity of this depends on the answer. And if there is no consistency at all, then you may only be able to achieve partial success with a Regex (ie: filtering out zip code and state) and will have to do the rest by hand (or at least go through the rest very carefully to make sure you spot the errors).&lt;/p&gt;

Because there are errors you won't get 100% accuracy, but there are a few things you can do to get most of the way there, and then do a visual BS test. Here's the general way to go about it. It's not code, because it's pretty academic to write it, there's no weirdness, just lots of string handling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Now that you've posted some sample data, I've made some minor changes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work backward. Start from the zip code, which will be near the end, and in one of two known formats: XXXXX or XXXXX-XXXX. If this doesn't appear, you can assume you're in the city, state portion, below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next thing, before the zip, is going to be the state, and it'll be either in a two-letter format, or as words. You know what these will be, too -- there's only 50 of them. Also, you could soundex the words to help compensate for spelling errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;before that is the city, and it's &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; on the same line as the state. You could use a &lt;a href="http://zipinfo.com"&gt;zip-code database&lt;/a&gt; to check the city and state based on the zip, or at least use it as a BS detector.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The street address will generally be one or two lines. The second line will generally be the suite number if there is one, but it could also be a PO box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's going to be near-impossible to detect a name on the first or second line, though if it's not prefixed with a number (or if it's prefixed with an "attn:" or "attention to:" it could give you a hint as to whether it's a name or an address line.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would start at the end of the string.  Parse a Zip-code (either format).  Read end to first space. If no Zip Code was found Error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trim the end then for spaces and special chars (commas)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then move on to State, again use the Space as the delimiter.  Maybe use a lookup list to validate 2 letter state codes, and full state names.  If no valid state found, error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trim spaces and commas from the end again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;City gets tricky, I would actually use a comma here, at the risk of getting too much data in the city.  Look for the comma, or beginning of the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you still have chars left in the string, shove all of that into an address field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

With the format you can see, at a glance, what the final structure of the string will be when reading the code, with concatenation it becomes almost impossible to immediately discern the final result (except with a very simple example like this one).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What that means in the long run is that when you come back to make a change to your string format, you will either have the ability to pop in and make a few adjustments to the format string, or wrinkle your brow and start moving around all kinds of property accessors mixed with text, which is more likely to introduce problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're using .NET 3.5 you can use an extension method &lt;a href="http://james.newtonking.com/archive/2008/03/27/formatwith-string-format-extension-method.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt; and get an easy flowing, off the cuff syntax like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Formatting is the .NET way of doing it. Certain refactoring tools (Refactor! for one) will even propose to refactor the concat-style code to use the formatting style.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formatting is easier to optimize for the compiler (although the second will probably be refactored to use the 'Concat' method which is fast).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formatting is usually clearer to read (especially with fancy formatting).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formatting means implicit calls to '.ToString' on all variables, which is good for readability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to Effective C#, the .NET 'WriteLine' and 'Format' implementations are messed up, they autobox all value types (which is bad). Effective C# advises to perform '.ToString' calls explicitly, which IMHO is bogus (see &lt;a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000878.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jeff's posting&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the moment, formatting type hints are not checked by the compiler, resulting in runtime errors. However, this could be amended in future versions.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As has been mentioned I would work backwards from the zip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have a zip I would query a zip database, store the results, and remove them &amp;amp; the zip from the string. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That will leave you with the address mess. MOST (All?) addresses will start with a number so  find the first occurrence of a number in the remaining string and grab everything from it to the (new) end of the string. That will be your address. Anything to the left of that number is likely an addressee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should now have the City, State, &amp;amp; Zip stored in a table and possibly two strings, addressee and address. For the address, check for the existence of "Suite" or "Apt." etc. and split that into two values (address lines 1 &amp;amp; 2). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the addressee I would punt and grab the last word of that string as the last name and put the rest into the first name field. If you don't want to do that, you'll need to check for salutation (Mr., Ms., Dr., etc.) at the start and make some assumptions based on the number of spaces as to how the name is made up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think there's any way you can parse with 100% accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either do it manually, (build a nice gui that helps the user do it quickly) or have it automated and check against a recent address database (you have to buy that) and manually handle errors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manual handling will take about 10 seconds each, meaning you can do 3600/10 = 360 per hour, so 4000 should take you approximately 11-12 hours. This will give you a high rate of accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For automation, you &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; a recent US address database, and tweak your rules against that.  I suggest not going fancy on the regex (hard to maintain long-term, so many exceptions). Go for 90% match against the database, do the rest manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do get a copy of Postal Addressing Standards (USPS) at &lt;a href="http://pe.usps.gov/cpim/ftp/pubs/Pub28/pub28.pdf"&gt;&lt;a href="http://pe.usps.gov/cpim/ftp/pubs/Pub28/pub28.pdf"&gt;http://pe.usps.gov/cpim/ftp/pubs/Pub28/pub28.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and notice it is 130+ pages long. Regexes to implement that would be nuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For international addresses, all bets are off. US-based workers would not be able to validate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, use a data service. I have, however, no recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore: when you do send out the stuff in the mail (that's what it's for, right?) make sure you put "address correction requested" on the envelope (in the right place) and &lt;em&gt;update&lt;/em&gt; the database. (We made a simple gui for the front desk person to do that; the person who actually sorts through the mail)&lt;/p&gt;

var add6 = adder(6); // Using implicit typing

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the snippet of Python and JavaScript, the function adder takes in an argument x, and returns an anonymous function, or lambda, that takes another argument y. That anonymous function allows you to create functions from functions. This is a simple example, but it should convey the power lambdas and closures have.&lt;/p&gt;

public void Calculator(Int32 a, Int32 b, Op op)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Calculator: op(" + a + ", " + b + ") = " + op(a, b));
}

public void Test()
{
    Calculator(10, 23, delegate(Int32 a, Int32 b)
    {
        return a + b;
    });
    Calculator(10, 23, delegate(Int32 a, Int32 b)
    {
        return a - b;
    });
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then in C# 3.0 we got lambdas which makes the code even shorter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-cs prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;public delegate Int32 Op(Int32 a, Int32 b);

public void Calculator(Int32 a, Int32 b, Op op)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Calculator: op(" + a + ", " + b + ") = " + op(a, b));
}

public void Test()
{
    Calculator(10, 23, (a, b) =&amp;gt; a + b);
    Calculator(10, 23, (a, b) =&amp;gt; a - b);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time I wrote it, I considered the labeled continue as a readable solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked SO a &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15481/java-coding-standard-best-practices-labeled-brakecontinue#15501" rel="nofollow"&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; about the convention (having the label in all caps or not) for labels in Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically every answer told me "do not use them - there is always a better way! refactor!". So I posted this question to ask for a more readable (and therefore better?) solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until now, I am not completely convinced by the alternatives presented so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please don't get me wrong. Labels are evil most of the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in my case, the conditional tests are pretty simple and the algorithm is taken from a mathematical paper and therefore very likely to not change in the near future. So I prefer having all the relevant parts visible at once instead of having to scroll to another method named something like checkMatrixAtRow(x).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially at more complex mathematical algorithms, I find it pretty hard to find "good" function-names - but I guess that is yet another question&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In C# lambda syntax is often compiled to simple methods in the same way as anonymous delegates, but it can also be broken down and its logic read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance (in C#3):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;LinqToSqlContext.Where( 
    row =&amp;gt; row.FieldName &amp;gt; 15 );
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LinqToSql can read that function (x &gt; 15) and convert it to the actual SQL to execute using expression trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statement above becomes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;select ... from [tablename] 
where [FieldName] &amp;gt; 15      --this line was 'read' from the lambda function
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is different from normal methods or anonymous delegates (which are just compiler magic really) because they cannot be &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all methods in C# that use lambda syntax can be compiled to expression trees (i.e. actual lambda functions). For instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;LinqToSqlContext.Where( 
    row =&amp;gt; SomeComplexCheck( row.FieldName ) );
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the expression tree cannot be read - SomeComplexCheck cannot be broken down. The SQL statement will execute without the where, and every row in the data will be put through &lt;code&gt;SomeComplexCheck&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lambda functions should not be confused with anonymous methods. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;LinqToSqlContext.Where( 
    delegate ( DataRow row ) { 
        return row.FieldName &amp;gt; 15; 
    } );
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also has an 'inline' function, but this time it's just compiler magic - the C# compiler will split this out to a new instance method with an autogenerated name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anonymous methods can't be read, and so the logic can't be translated out as it can for lambda functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use LabVIEW mainly for testing where we take continuous measurements and control gas valves and ATE enclosures. This involves both digital and analogue input and outputs with signal analysis routines and process control all running from a GUI. By breaking down each part into subVIs we are able to reconfigure the tests with the click and drag of the mouse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not exactly the same as C/C++ but a similar implementation of measurement, control and analysis using Visual BASIC appears complex and hard to maintain by comparision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the process of programming is more important than the actual coding language and you should follow the style guidelines for a graphical programming language. LabVIEW block diagrams show the flow of data (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dataflow programming&lt;/a&gt;) so it should be easy to see potential race conditions although I've never had any problems. If you have a C codebase then building it into a dll will allow LabVIEW to call it directly.&lt;/p&gt;

Anyway, if you can do this without trashing the rest of your application -- are there other places where the "name" column needs to be case-sensitive? -- try making that whole column case-insensitive by changing the collation, then index the column.&lt;/p&gt;

Making the column's collation be case-insensitive would make the index store 'San Francisco', 'SAN FRANCISCO', and 'san francisco' all together.

You could also go a completely different route.  Since you'll only be sending information back when the form design is complete, you could do it with a form submit, for a bunch of hidden fields. Create your hidden fields using javascript and set the values as needed.  This would probably be the best solution if didn't want to deal with JSON/XML at all.&lt;/p&gt;

It's good if the only cmd line support for a product comes via PS (Exchange, Windows 2k8), etc. but if all you want to do is parse some text or access regular .NET objects PS just adds a crazy syntax and stupid Security Iron Curtain to what could be a quick and easy little .NET app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree the easiest (and best solution for SEO purposes) is the 301 redirect.  In IIS this is fairly trivial, you'd create a site for subdomain.hostone.com, after creating the site, right-click on the site and go into properties.  Click on the "Home Directory" tab of the site properties window that opens. Select the radio button "A redirection to a URL", enter the url for the new site (&lt;a href="http://subdomain.hosttwo.com"&gt;http://subdomain.hosttwo.com&lt;/a&gt;), and check the checkboxes for "The exact URL entered above", "A permanent redirection for this resource" (this second checkbox causes a 301 redirect, instead of a 302 redirect).  Click OK, and you're done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you could create a page on the site of &lt;a href="http://subdomain.hostone.com"&gt;http://subdomain.hostone.com&lt;/a&gt;, using one of the following methods (depending on what the hosting platform supports)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PHP Redirect:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&amp;lt;?
Header( "HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently" ); 
Header( "Location: " ); 
?&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASP Redirect:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&amp;lt;%@ Language=VBScript %&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;%
Response.Status="301 Moved Permanently"
Response.AddHeader "Location","http://subdomain.hosttwo.com"
%&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASP .NET Redirect:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&amp;lt;script runat="server"&amp;gt;
private void Page_Load(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
Response.Status = "301 Moved Permanently";
Response.AddHeader("Location","http://subdomain.hosttwo.com");
}
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now assuming your CNAME record is correctly created, then the only problem you are experiencing is that the site created for &lt;a href="http://subdomain.hosttwo.com"&gt;http://subdomain.hosttwo.com&lt;/a&gt; is using a shared IP, and host headers to determine which site should be displayed.  To resolve this issue under IIS, in IIS Manager on the web server, you'd right-click on the site for subdomain.hosttwo.com, and click "Properties".  On the displayed "Web Site" tab, you should see an "Advanced" button next to the IP address that you'll need to click.  On the "Advanced Web Site Identification" window that appears, click "Add".  Select the same IP address that is already being used by subdomain.hosttwo.com, enter 80 as the TCP port, and then enter subdomain.hosttwo.com as the Host Header value.  Click OK until you are back to the main IIS Manager window, and you should be good to go.  Open a browser, and browse to &lt;a href="http://subdomain.hostone.com"&gt;http://subdomain.hostone.com&lt;/a&gt;, and you'll see the site at &lt;a href="http://subdomain.hosttwo.com"&gt;http://subdomain.hosttwo.com&lt;/a&gt; appear, even though your URL shows &lt;a href="http://subdomain.hostone.com"&gt;http://subdomain.hostone.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps...&lt;/p&gt;

I want to write a function to return a &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/reference.html#GLatLngBounds" rel="nofollow"&gt;GLatLngBounds&lt;/a&gt; object which is extended from the current map bounds to show all the HeadPoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heres what I have so far..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function getBounds() {
    var mBound = map.getBounds();
    for (var i = 0; i &amp;lt; tPoints.length; i++) {
     alert(mBound.getSouthWest().lat() + "," + mBound.getSouthWest().lng());
     alert(mBound.getNorthEast().lat() + "," + mBound.getNorthEast().lng());
            currPoint = trackMarkers[i].getHeadPoint();        
            if (!mBound.containsLatLng(currPoint)) {
                mBound.extend(currPoint);
            }
        }
    return mBound;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which returns these values for the alert. (Generally over the US)&lt;br /&gt;
"19.64258,NaN"&lt;br /&gt;
"52.69636,NaN"&lt;br /&gt;
"i=0"&lt;br /&gt;

"52.69636,-117.20701"&lt;br /&gt;
"i=1"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know why I am getting NaN back.
When I use the bounds to get a zoom level I think the NaN value is causing the map.getBoundsZoomLevel(bounds) to return 0 which is incorrect.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/Seat (\d+): ([^\(]+) \((\d+)in chips\)/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And some basic explanation on how Regex works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;\d = digit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;\&amp;lt;character&gt; = escapes character, if not part of any character class or subexpression. for example: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;\t&lt;/code&gt; 
would render a tab, while &lt;code&gt;\\t&lt;/code&gt; would render "\t" (since the backslash is escaped).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;+ = one or more of the preceding element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;* = zero or more of the preceding element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ ] =  bracket expression. Matches any of the characters within the bracket. Also works with ranges (ex. A-Z).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;[^ ] = Matches any character that is NOT within the bracket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;( ) = Marked subexpression. The data matched within this can be recalled later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I chose to use &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;([^\(]+)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;since the example provides a name containing spaces (Seat 3 in the example). what this does is that it matches any character up to the point that it encounters an opening paranthesis.
This will leave you with a blank space at the end of the subexpression (using the data provided in the example). However, his can easily be stripped away using the trim() command in PHP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not want to match spaces, only alphanumerical characters, you could so something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;([A-Za-z0-9-_]+)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which would match any letter (within A-Z, both upper- &amp;amp; lower-case), number as well as hyphens and underscores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or the same variant, with spaces:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;([A-Za-z0-9-_\s]+)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where "\s" is evaluated into a space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Free" hosting services. Most of these will make you subdomain on them and worse, they'll put a header and a footer on your page (sometimes in gaudy frame format) that they advertise heavily on. I don't care how poor you are, this will not help attract traffic to your app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of the cheaper rates depend on pre-payment. HostRocket will give you $4.99 a month in hosting, but you have to pre-pay for 3 years. If you go month to month, it is $8.99. There are definitely advantages to the pre-payment, but you don't want to get caught with close to twice the monthly payment if you weren't expecting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;SAFE is the default permission set, but its highly restrictive. With the SAFE setting, you can access only data from a local database to perform computational logic on that data.
  EXTERNAL_ACCESS is the next step in the permissions hierarchy. This setting lets you access external resources such as the file system, Windows Event Viewer, and Web services. This type of resource access isnt possible in SQL Server 2000 and earlier. This permission set also restricts operations such as pointer access that affect the robustness of your assembly.
  The UNSAFE permission set assumes full trust of the assembly and thus imposes no "Code Access Security" limitations. This setting is comparable to the way extended stored procedures functionyou assume all the code is safe. However, this setting does restrict the creation of unsafe assemblies to users who have sysadmin permissions. Microsoft recommends that you avoid creating unsafe assemblies as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Does anyone know of anyway to
  reduce/optimize the PDF export phase
  and or the size of the PDF without
  lowering the total page count?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a few ideas and questions:&lt;br /&gt;
1. Is this a graphics-heavy report?  If not, do you have tables that start out as text but are converted into a graphic by the SSRS PDF renderer (check if you can select the text in the PDF)?  41K per page might be more than it should be, or it might not, depending on how information-dense your report is.  But we've had cases where we had minor issues with a report's layout, like having a table bleed into the page's margins, that resulted in the SSRS PDF renderer "throwing up its hands" and rendering the table as an image instead of as text.  Obviously, the fewer graphics in your report, the smaller your file size will be.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Is there a way that you could easily break the report into pieces?  E.g., if it's a 10-location report, where Location 1 is followed by Location 2, etc., on your final report, could you run the Location 1 portion independent of the Location 2 portion, etc.?  If so, you could join the 10 sub-reports into one final PDF using &lt;a href="http://pdfsharp.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;PDFSharp&lt;/a&gt; after you've received them all.  This leads to some difficulties with page numbering, but nothing insurmountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;3. Does anyone else have any other
  theories as to why this runs on the
  server but not through the API?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My guess would be the sheer size of the report.  I don't remember everything about what's an IIS setting and what's SSRS-specific, but there might be some overall IIS settings (maybe in Metabase.xml) that you would have to be updated to even allow that much data to pass through. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could isolate the question of whether the time is the problem by taking one of your working reports and building in a long wait time in your stored procedures with WAITFOR (assuming SQL Server for your DBMS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not solutions, per se, but ideas.  Hope it helps.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Lots of companies have rules like that, but in the UK (and EU) they're not enforceable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a lawyer, but as it happens we are currently in the process of reviewing our employee contracts and we do have a real lawyer looking at the process.  We recieved the following advice from him earlier today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Where there is an issue as to whether an employee or their employer owns IP rights in the output of their work, legislation in the UK generally favours employers. For example, in general terms, relevant legislation gives an employer automatic ownership of, copyright, patents, unregistered designs database rights and registered designs in works created by its employees in certain circumstances. However, the high incidence of claims over employee IP rights means that the position also needs to be looked at carefully here.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Particular issues arise where an employee makes or creates something outside his normal working hours or outside of his specific duties but which nevertheless could be valuable to the employer in connection with his business. Here, the employer may wish to ensure that there is an express provision in the contract of employment for the employer to retain ownership. Care should be taken here, however, since if it is also outside the course of his employment or specific duties, this might be deemed undue influence, duress or restraint of trade unless valuable consideration is given to the employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this is specific to the UK and hence YMMV.&lt;/p&gt;

    Dim folder As String = Path.Combine(Path.GetTempPath, Guid.NewGuid.ToString)
    Do While Directory.Exists(folder) or File.Exists(folder)
        folder = Path.Combine(Path.GetTempPath, Guid.NewGuid.ToString)
    Loop

    Return folder
End Function
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;guid&lt;/strong&gt; Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C:\Documents and Settings\username\Local Settings\Temp\2dbc6db7-2d45-4b75-b27f-0bd492c60496&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, you need to be aware of the contract with &lt;em&gt;hashCode&lt;/em&gt;, and similarly, watch out for the gotchas around the &lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Comparable&lt;/a&gt; interface - in almost all situations you want the &lt;em&gt;natural ordering&lt;/em&gt; as defined by Comparable to be &lt;em&gt;consistent with equals&lt;/em&gt; (see the &lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/math/BigDecimal.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/a&gt; api doc for the canonical counter example)&lt;/p&gt;

In its simplest form you make a single OSGi bundle out of your entire application. Clearly this is not a best practice but it can be useful to get a feel for deploying a bundle in an OSGi container (Equinox, Felix, Knoplerfish, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To take it to the next level you'll want to start splitting your app into components, components should typically have a set of responsibilities that can be isolated from the rest of your application through a set of interfaces and class dependencies. Identifying these purely by hand can range from rather straightforward for a well designed highly cohesive but loosely coupled application to a nightmare for interlocked source code that you are not familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some help can come from tools like &lt;a href="http://clarkware.com/software/JDepend.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;JDepend&lt;/a&gt; which can show you the coupling of Java packages against other packages/classes in your system. A package with low efferent coupling should be easier to extract into an OSGi bundle than one with high efferent coupling. Even more architectural insight can be had with pro tools like &lt;a href="http://www.headwaysoftware.com/products/structure101/index.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;Structure 101&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purely on a technical level, working daily with an application that consists of 160 OSGi bundles and using Spring DM I can confirm that the transition from "normal" Spring to Spring DM is largely pain free. The extra namespace and the fact that you can (and should) isolate your OSGi specific Spring configuration in separate files makes it even easier to have both with and without OSGi deployment scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OSGi is a deep and wide component model, documentation I recommend:&lt;/p&gt;

I've seen version control implemented very poorly and just OK, but never great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to get the ball rolling, here is a review of things I've seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example is SVN-based, but applies to most VCS's (not so much to distributed version control).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;branch the individual projects that are part of site
/division/web/projectName/vb/src/[trunk|branches|tags]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;branch the whole site, in the case I've seen, the whole site except for core components was branched.
/division/[trunk|branches|tags]/web/projectName/vb/src/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use main-line a default, only branch when necessary for &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt; changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trunk should be kept at a point where you can always push a release from it. There should be no huge gaping bugs that you know about(of course there will be eventually but that is what you should strive for). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time you need to make a new feature, do a design change, whatever, branch. Tag that branch at the start. Then when you are finished with the branch tag it at the end. This helps out with merging back into trunk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time you need to push a release, tag. This way if something goes horribly wrong you can rollback to the previous release. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This setup keeps trunk as clean as possible and allows you to make quick bug fixes and push them out while keeping the majority of your development in branches. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; For 3rd party stuff it depends. If I can avoid it I do not have it under source control. I keep it in a directory outside source control and include it from there. For things like jquery, I do leave it under source control. The reason is it simplifies my script for pushing. I can simply have it do an svn export and rsync. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are keen on Visual Studio integration, I would probably recommend Subversion, as there are a number of plugins that may make your life easier. Also, TortoiseSVN is definitely worth installing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any architectural decision -- especially at this level --  is a trade-off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kind of messages need to be passed between the systems?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What types of data need to be shared?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there an important requirement to support complex model objects or will primitives + arrays do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what is the volume of the data?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;What is the acceptable communication latency?&lt;/li&gt;

If you've got a team of 50 with several people working on major changes simultaneously and releases only occurring every 6 months, it makes a lot of sense for everyone to have his own branch where he can work in isolation and only merge in changes from other people when he wants them.  On the other hand, if you're a team of 5 all sitting in the same room it makes sense to branch much less frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming you're working on a small team where communication and collaboration is good and releases are frequent, it makes very little sense to ever branch IMO.  On one project we simply rolled the SVN revision number into the product version number for all our releases and we never even tagged.  In the rare event that there was a critical bug found in prod we would simply branch straight from the revision that was released.  But most of the time we simply fixed the bug in the branch and released from trunk at the end of the week as scheduled.  If your releases are frequent enough you'll almost never run into a bug that can't wait until the next official release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've worked on other projects where we never could have gotten away with that, but due to the lightweight development process and low ceremony we were able to use a lightweight version control policy very effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll also mention that everything I've written is coming from an enterprise IT context where there's only a single production instance of a given code base.  If I was working on a product that was deployed at 100 different customer sites the branching and tagging practices would have to be a little more strenuous in order to manage all of the independent update cycles across all the instances.&lt;/p&gt;
