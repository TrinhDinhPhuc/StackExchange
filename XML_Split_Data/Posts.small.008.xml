Something that constantly frustrates me is that people don't want to learn any more than they need to about the programming languages they use every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many programmers seem content to learn some pidgin sub-dialect, and stick with that. If they see a keyword or construct that they aren't familiar with, they'll complain that the code is "tricky."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would you think of a civil engineer who shied away from calculus because it had "all those tricky math symbols?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not suggesting that we all need to become "language lawyers." But if you make your living as a programmer, and claim to be a competent user of language X, then I think at a minimum you should know the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the keywords of the language and what they do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the valid syntactic forms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how memory, files, and other operating system resources are managed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where the official language specification and library reference for the language is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last one is the one that really gets me. Many programmers seem to have no idea that there is a "specification" or "standard" for any particular language. I still talk to people who think that Microsoft invented C++, and that if a program doesn't compile under VC6, it's not a valid C++ program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programmers these days have it easy when it comes to obtaining specs. Newer languages like C#, Java, Python, Ruby, etc. all have their documentation available for free from the vendors' web sites. Older languages and platforms often have standards controlled by standards bodies that demand payment for specs, but even that shouldn't be a deterrent: the C++ standard is available from ISO for $30 (and why am I the only person I know who has a copy?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programming is hard enough even when you do know the language. If you don't, I don't see how you have a chance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do the rest of you think?  Am I right, or should we all be content with the typical level of programming language expertise?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Several great comments here.  Thanks.  A couple of people hit on something that I didn't think about:  What really irks me is not the lack of knowledge, but the lack of curiosity and willingness to learn.  It seems some people don't have any time to hone their craft, but they have plenty of time to write lots of bad code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't expect people to be able to recite a list of keywords or EBNF expressions, or to spend their free time browsing through specs, but I do expect that when they see some code, they should have some inkling of what it does.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few people have complete knowledge of every dark corner of their language or platform, but everyone should at least know enough that when they see something unfamiliar, they will know how to get whatever additional information they need to understand it. It should be seen as an opportunity to learn something new, not an opportunity to complain about "language lawyers".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common use for a cross-process Mutex is to ensure that only instance of a program can run at a time. Here's how it's done:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class OneAtATimePlease {

  // Use a name unique to the application (eg include your company URL)
  static Mutex mutex = new Mutex (false, "oreilly.com OneAtATimeDemo");

  static void Main()
  {
    // Wait 5 seconds if contended  in case another instance
    // of the program is in the process of shutting down.
    if (!mutex.WaitOne(TimeSpan.FromSeconds (5), false))
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Another instance of the app is running. Bye!");
        return;
    }

    try
    {    
        Console.WriteLine("Running - press Enter to exit");
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
    finally
    {
        mutex.ReleaseMutex();
    }    
  }    
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good feature of Mutex is that if the application terminates without ReleaseMutex first being called, the CLR will release the Mutex automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very hard, almost impossible to figure out what letter Windows would assign to a particular drive partition, without actually running Windows. This is because Windows always associates the drive that it is run from with C:. Which could be any drive, if you have more than one operating system installed. Windows also allows you to choose what drive letter it will try first, for a specific partition, causing further problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be a whole lot easier to do the GUI stuff inside Linux, than to try this mixed Window/Linux solution. I'm not say don't try it this way, what I am saying is there are very many possible pitfalls with this approach. I'm sure I don't even know about all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option would be to see if you could actually do the Linux part, inside of Windows. If you are a very good Windows programmer, you can actually get access to the raw file-system. There are probably just as many pitfalls with this approach, because Windows will be running while all of this is in operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to re-iterate I would see if you could do everything from within Linux, if you can. It's just a whole lot simpler in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

The only thing I can think of is that there are a couple extra bytes for the callback wrapper... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href="http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; which also suggests security and error handling as potential problems... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There's no error handling. The script
  injection either works, or it doesn't.
  If there's an error from the
  injection, it'll hit the page, and
  short of a window wide error handler
  (bad, bad, very bad), you need to be
  sure the return value is valid on the
  server side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think error handling is much of a problem... most of us would use a library to generate the JSON... the well-formedness of my response isn't a concern for this question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and security:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Security. There's documents out on the
  web that can help, but as a cursory
  check, I would check the referrer in
  the server side script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it seems like this is a potential problem with any type of response... certainly there's nothing unique to JSONP in the security arena...?&lt;/p&gt;

But then there are languages that I don't use that often, like Python, about which I probably don't know everything. I still try to find out at least what's possible to do with the language so if I ever have the need to do something that I don't know the syntax or idiom for, I'll know that it exists and look it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the bare minimum for any language is declarations, operation definitions, operation invocation, common types, conditional construct, and loop construct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know only that much but know everything there is to know about the programming library you care about then you can probably do just as much in the library's domain as someone who knows all about a language and how to best implement various algorithms but knows next to nothing about the library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a look at Java: most Java programmers probably don't even know or care much about generics but they can do a lot with Java's class library as well as knowing the numerous frameworks at their disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What are all the keywords of the language?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that you would be hard pressed for find someone that can name every single keyword and what they mean for all of the languages that they work with off the top of their head. However, I think that if you specialize in a given language (e.g. A C++ programmer), this should be the case. In the case of someone that works with several languages on a daily basis, knowing all of the major ones and being able to quickly find documentation on the rest of them should be sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What are all the valid syntactic forms?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likely depends on the language you are working with - if you are working with Perl, where &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_is_more_than_one_way_to_do_it" rel="nofollow"&gt;there is more than one way to do it&lt;/a&gt;, then I definitely hold it against anyone to not know anything. However, this is also another area where I think that a good programmer should know the major syntactical forms and be able to look-up the rest of them if need be. At a bare minimum they shouldn't think that it is invalid just because it doesn't follow the most common syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How are memory, files, and other operating system resources managed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one area where I agree with you in that I think that you should have a good understanding of how these things work in the language you are working with. When I first started working with ASP.NET I encountered a number of bugs in my applications that were entirely due to me not fully understanding the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178472.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;page life cycle&lt;/a&gt;; however, once I took the time to read up on it, I was able to better understand things. Also, this becomes even more important in some environments where an algorithm might not be as fast as you thought it might be due to how the system is storing arrays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Where is the official language specification and library reference for the language?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this day an age with so much information being only a Google search away, I would likely raise an eyebrow at someone that was a programmer and couldn't find this information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the larger part of your question, in some cases I don't think you should be entirely content with some of the programming language expertise; however, in the case of some junior developers I think that it is just something that you have to expect and perhaps even mentor them to develop this expertise. Once you start to get more experience under your belt though and make the transition away from being a junior developer, you lose some of this expectation and indeed you should be able to expect an experienced developer to know most of these things. As such, I think that the more experienced you are as a developer, the more that is expected of you in terms of knowledge and it is reasonable for an experienced developer to have a good, but not necessarily perfect, understanding of all of these things.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If this is for gaining the benefit of
  a data-structure holding arbitrary
  index types, optimized for searching
  and good at insertion then consider
  using a map.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;A map is an associative container that
  has performance guarantees identical
  to those of a tree: logarithmic
  searching, logarithmic insertion,
  logarithmic deletion, linear space.
  Internally they are often implemented
  as red-black trees, although that is
  not a guarantee. Still, as an STL user
  all you should care about is the
  performance guarantees of the STL
  algorithms and data-structures.
  Whether they're implemented as trees
  or little green men shouldn't matter
  to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if a map is what I need, but thanks for the info.  I will remember to use maps whenever possible instead of implementing trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were ~30 C++ projects which needed compiling, and various .NET/Java things, and the odd perl script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was all built on our build machine using NAnt - If I were doing it today I'd use &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/rake.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;rake&lt;/a&gt;, but the idea is the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We basically had an auto-incrementing build number which was stored in a version.txt file in the root of the repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each time we did a build (automatically done each night, or also on-demand if neccessary) the script would increment this number and check the file back into source control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the other apps referenced this file for their version number, or for things which didn't support working like this, the script would set environment variables or perform other workarounds&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm pretty sure that our installshield programs referenced an environment variable for their version number, but we deprecated them in favour of &lt;a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow"&gt;wix&lt;/a&gt; as installshield really did suck&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the case of visual studio, grep/replace the number within the .csproj files, and check them back in&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Statement:&lt;/strong&gt; A line of code which does something. Example: &lt;em&gt;GOTO 100&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the earliest general-purpose programming languages, like FORTRAN, the distinction was crystal-clear. In FORTRAN, a statement was one unit of execution, a thing that you did. The only reason it wasn't called a "line" was because sometimes it spanned multiple lines. An expression on its own couldn't do anything... you had to assign it to a variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1 + 2 / X&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is an error in FORTRAN, because it doesn't do anything. You had to do something with that expression:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;X = 1 + 2 / X&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FORTRAN didn't have a grammar as we know it today&amp;mdash;that idea was invented, along with Backus-Naur Form (BNF), as part of the definition of Algol-60.  At that point the &lt;em&gt;semantic&lt;/em&gt; distinction ("have a value" versus "do something") was enshrined in &lt;em&gt;syntax&lt;/em&gt;: one kind of phrase was an expression, and another was a statement, and the parser could tell them apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designers of later languages blurred the distinction: they allowed syntactic expressions to do things, and they allowed syntactic statements that had values.
The earliest popular language example that still survives is C. The designers of C realized that no harm was done if you were allowed to evaluate an expression and throw away the result. In C, every syntactic expression can be a made into a statement just by tacking a semicolon along the end:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1 + 2 / x;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is a totally legit statement even though absolutely nothing will happen.  Similarly, in C, an expression can have &lt;em&gt;side-effects&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;it can change something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1 + 2 / callfunc(12);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;because &lt;code&gt;callfunc&lt;/code&gt; might just do something useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you allow any expression to be a statement, you might as well allow the assignment operator (=) inside expressions. That's why C lets you do things like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;callfunc(x = 2);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This evaluates the expression x = 2 (assigning the value of 2 to x) and then passes that (the 2) to the function &lt;code&gt;callfunc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blurring of expressions and statements occurs in all the C-derivatives (C, C++, C#, and Java), which still have some statements (like &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;) but which allow almost any expression to be used as a statement (in C# only assignment, call, increment, and decrement expressions may be used as statements; see Scott Wisniewski's answer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having two "syntactic categories" (which is the technical name for the sort of thing statements and expressions are) can lead to duplication of effort.   For example, C has two forms of conditional, the statement form&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (E) S1; else S2;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the expression form&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;E ? E1 : E2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And sometimes people &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; duplication that isn't there: in standard C, for example, only a statement can declare a new local variable&amp;mdash;but this ability is useful enough that the 
GNU C compiler provides a GNU extension that enables an expression to declare a local variable as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designers of other languages didn't like this kind of duplication, and they saw early on that if expressions can have side effects as well as values, then the &lt;em&gt;syntactic&lt;/em&gt; distinction between statements and expressions is not all that useful&amp;mdash;so they got rid of it.  Haskell, Icon, Lisp, and ML are all languages that don't have syntactic statements&amp;mdash;they only have expressions.  Even the class structured looping and conditional forms are considered expressions, and they have values&amp;mdash;but not very interesting ones.&lt;/p&gt;

The streams are interesting,but I don't see how any version control can magically avoid collisions when two people touch the same code in the same file. Accurev's model was intriguing, but at the end of the day, nice clean branching and merging with a drop dead easy interface made Plastic the choice for us.

&lt;p&gt;In perhaps a tangential manner of thinking in relation to this issue, I generally feel most junior programmers are way out of touch with the &lt;em&gt;underpinnings&lt;/em&gt; of how things work with  languages, environments, protocols, even computers in general -- you name it.  I think that underlying knowledge is so critical to designing well performing systems and writing good code, and goes back to having an understanding of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; something is done a certain way as opposed to only &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; it is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it's become easier since Visual Basic ushered in the era of RAD development to the masses to screw things up more.  This was a critically important event in software development, no doubt, but I think this path of evolution, while making good developers more productive, allows others to be productive enough without necessarily fully understanding what they are doing.  Am I making sense?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've always been a believer that if someone was a student of computer science, then they ought to be able to code in any language and understand the importance of knowing the nuances of differently languages.  I think this may be perhaps more important than knowing all the keywords and syntactical forms (with Rob's notable exception).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I too have similar frustration with programmers who don't quite get what's really happening.  I could add to your list of items:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many of those programmers don't know how HTTP works in its simplest form?  How many of them don't know you can get RFC's online that specify all of these protocols and roll your own clients and servers and mail readers, etc?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many of those programmers don't understand why it's important to minimize your database calls or get as much data as you need in one round-trip to the database and ideally no more than is required?  (Or for any remote call for that matter!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are a couple of my pet peeves.  I'm sure there are more.&lt;/p&gt;

Part of this tool is another application (The Cruise Control Dashboard) that runs in its own Virtual Directory under my root application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to limit access to this internal application by setting up Forms Authentication on it, and having a login form in the root application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put the following into the root applications web.config:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;location path="ccnet"&amp;gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can't audit your code and find where the reference leaks are, an alternative is to recycle the application by restarting IIS every 24 hours or so. You can just setup a commandline script as a server job to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a piece of code extracted from its website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int main(int, char **)
   {
   tree&amp;lt;string&amp;gt; tr;
   tree&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;::iterator top, one, two, loc, banana;

   top=tr.begin();
   one=tr.insert(top, "one");
   two=tr.append_child(one, "two");
   tr.append_child(two, "apple");
   banana=tr.append_child(two, "banana");
   tr.append_child(banana,"cherry");
   tr.append_child(two, "peach");
   tr.append_child(one,"three");

   loc=find(tr.begin(), tr.end(), "two");
   if(loc!=tr.end()) {
      tree&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;::sibling_iterator sib=tr.begin(loc);
      while(sib!=tr.end(loc)) {
         cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (*sib) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; endl;
         ++sib;
         }
      cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; endl;
      tree&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;::iterator sib2=tr.begin(loc);
      tree&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;::iterator end2=tr.end(loc);
      while(sib2!=end2) {
         for(int i=0; i&amp;lt;tr.depth(sib2)-2; ++i) 
            cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; " ";
         cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (*sib2) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; endl;
         ++sib2;
         }
      }
   }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what's different? Your implementation is simpler when it comes to 
append a node to the tree. 
Though your version is indiscutably simpler, the dev of this lib probably wanted to have some info accessible without browsing the tree, such as the size of the tree for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also assume he didn't want to store the root on all nodes for performance reason.
So if you want to implement it your way, I suggest you keep most of the logic and add the link to the parent tree in the iterator and rewrite append a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

For several years we maintained a separate change script for each release. This script would contain the deltas from the last production release. With each release of the application, the version number would increment, giving something like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dbChanges_1.sql&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dbChanges_2.sql&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dbChanges_n.sql&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This worked well enough until we started maintaining two lines of development: Trunk/Mainline for new development, and a maintenance branch for bug fixes, short term enhancements, etc. Inevitably, the need arose to make changes to the schema in the branch. At this point, we already had dbChanges_n+1.sql in the Trunk, so we ended up going with a scheme like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dbChanges_n.1.sql&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dbChanges_n.2.sql&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dbChanges_n.3.sql&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this worked well enough, until we one day we looked up and saw 42 delta scripts in the mainline and 10 in the branch. ARGH!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days we simply maintain one delta script and let SVN version it - i.e. we overwrite the script with each release. And we shy away from making schema changes in branches. &lt;/p&gt;

In &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL" rel="nofollow"&gt;MySQL&lt;/a&gt;, adding a constraint is a single additional line of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language" rel="nofollow"&gt;DDL&lt;/a&gt;. It's just a handful of key words and a couple of seconds of thought. That's the only "cost" in my opinion...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools love foreign keys. Foreign keys prevent bad data (that is, orphaned rows) that may not affect business logic or functionality and therefor go unnoticed, and build up. It also prevents developers who are unfamiliar with the schema from implementing entire chunks of work without realizing they're missing a relationship. Perhaps everything is great within the scope of your current application, but if you missed something and someday something unexpected is added (think fancy reporting), you might be in a spot where you have to manually clean up bad data that's been accumulating since the inception of the schema without a database enforced check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The little time it takes to codify what's already in your head when you're putting things together could save you or someone else a bunch of grief months or years down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Are there any other uses for foreign
  keys? Am I missing something here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a bit loaded. Insert comments, indentation or variable naming in place of "foreign keys"... If you already understand the thing in question perfectly, it's "no use" to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, it is best practice to ALWAYS call the base method, unless you specifically know that you do not want the base behaviour to occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether its called at the start or the end depends on how you want things to work. In a case like this, where you are using an override instead of hooking up an event handler, calling it at the start of the method makes more sense. That way, your code will run after any handlers, which makes it more emulate a "normal" event handler.&lt;/p&gt;

public class ProvisioningService : WebService

    public XmlDocument ProcessMessage(XmlDocument message)
    {
        // ... do stuff
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am calling the web service from ASP using something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;provWSDL = "http://servername:12011/MessageProcessor.asmx?wsdl"
Set service = CreateObject("MSSOAP.SoapClient30")
service.ClientProperty("ServerHTTPRequest") = True
Call service.MSSoapInit(provWSDL)

xmlMessage = "&amp;lt;request&amp;gt;&amp;lt;task&amp;gt;....various xml&amp;lt;/task&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/request&amp;gt;"
result = service.ProcessMessage(xmlMessage)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem I am encountering is that when the XML reaches the ProcessMessage method, the web service plumbing has added a default namespace along the way. i.e. if I set a breakpoint inside ProcessMessage(XmlDocument message) I see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;request xmlns="http://internalservice.net/messageprocessing"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;task&amp;gt;....various xml&amp;lt;/task&amp;gt; 
&amp;lt;/request&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I capture packets on the wire I can see that the XML sent by the SOAP toolkit is slightly different from that sent by the .NET WS client. The SOAP toolkit sends:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;SOAP-ENV:Envelope 
    xmlns:SOAPSDK1="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" 
    xmlns:SOAPSDK2="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
    xmlns:SOAPSDK3="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/" 
    xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;SOAP-ENV:Body&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;ProcessMessage xmlns="http://internalservice.net/messageprocessing"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;message xmlns:SOAPSDK4="http://internalservice.net/messageprocessing"&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;request&amp;gt;
                    &amp;lt;task&amp;gt;...stuff to do&amp;lt;/task&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;/request&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/message&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/ProcessMessage&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/SOAP-ENV:Body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/SOAP-ENV:Envelope&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst the .NET client sends:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;soap:Envelope 
    xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" 
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

                &amp;lt;/request&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/message&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/ProcessMessage&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/soap:Body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/soap:Envelope&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been so long since I used the ASP/SOAP toolkit to call into .NET webservices, I can't remember all the clever tricks/SOAP-fu I used to pull to get around stuff like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any ideas? One solution is to knock up a COM callable .NET proxy that takes the XML as a string param and calls the WS on my behalf, but it's an extra layer of complexity/work I hoped not to do.&lt;/p&gt;

For example C/C++, C#, &lt;a href="http://www.digitalmars.com/d/"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://perl.org"&gt;Perl&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The language which is in common use today, that I really find difficult to understand, is shell scripting. Plus the keyword you use to end a construct isn't always the mirror of the beginning keyword. I don't think anyone would use it if it wasn't already so widely used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;READABLE:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perl&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if(     $anything == 1 ){
    # some code
}elsif( $anything == 2 ){
    # some code
}else{
    # some more code
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;UNREADABLE:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if [ $a == z* ] # File globbing and word splitting take place.
then
  if [[ $a == z* ]] # True if $a starts with an "z" (regex pattern matching).
  then
    echo do-something  # But only if both conditions are valid.
  fi  
fi
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know about you, but I keep wanting to end the if block like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if [ $Jack &amp;amp;&amp;amp; $Beanstalk ]
then
   echo plant beanstalk
fee fi fo fum
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Further&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those people who automatically say Perl is a terrible language, generally assume that it is unreadable because they take one look at the Regex &lt;strong&gt;sub-language&lt;/strong&gt;, and assume there is no possible way to rewrite it in a cleaner way. Which is completely wrong. The first thing you must learn is of the /x modifier, which allows whitespace embedded in the Regex to be used to separate out different parts of the Regex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we can turn this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/^([+-]?)(\d+\.\d+|\d+\.|\.\d+|\d+)([eE][+-]?\d+)?$/;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;into this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/
  ^
    ([+-]?)        # first, match an optional sign

    (              # then match integers or f.p. mantissas:
         \d+\.\d+  # mantissa of the form a.b
        |\d+\.     # mantissa of the form a.
        |\.\d+     # mantissa of the form .b
        |\d+       # integer of the form a
    )

    ([eE][+-]?\d+)?  # finally, optionally match an exponent
  $
/x;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which I might add (as far as I know) is not available in any other general purpose Regular Expression librarys, accessible within other languages. So in other words if you are using another language you are stuck with the first form, or you have to write significantly more code to achieve the same ends, which &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; be error prone. See &lt;a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlretut.html#Building-a-regexp"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually Perl can be &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; powerful, imagine running arbitrary code, from within a Regex. &lt;em&gt;Don't worry you're not allowed to use interpolation with this feature, by default.&lt;/em&gt; Also this feature, last I heard is experimental, although I would bet it will stay in the language in some form or another. I know for a fact, it is a feature of &lt;a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6"&gt;Perl 6&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$x =~ /(?{print "Hi Mom!";})/;       # matches,
                                     # prints 'Hi Mom!'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Yet another useful feature:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Named back-references&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;( copied directly from &lt;a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlretut.html#Named-backreferences"&gt;perldoc perlretut&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perl 5.10 also introduced named capture buffers and named backreferences. To attach a name to a capturing group, you write either &lt;code&gt;(?&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;...)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;(?'name'...)&lt;/code&gt;. The backreference may then be written as &lt;code&gt;\g{name}&lt;/code&gt; . It is permissible to attach the same name to more than one group, but then only the leftmost one of the eponymous set can be referenced. Outside of the pattern a named capture buffer is accessible through the &lt;code&gt;%+&lt;/code&gt; hash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming that we have to match calendar dates which may be given in one of the three formats &lt;code&gt;yyyy-mm-dd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;mm/dd/yyyy&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;dd.mm.yyy&lt;/code&gt;y, we can write three suitable patterns where we use &lt;code&gt;'day'&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;'month'&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;'year'&lt;/code&gt; respectively as the names of the buffers capturing the pertaining components of a date. The matching operation combines the three patterns as alternatives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$fmt1 = '(?&amp;lt;year&amp;gt;\d\d\d\d)-(?&amp;lt;mon&amp;gt;\d\d)-(?&amp;lt;day&amp;gt;\d\d)';
$fmt2 = '(?&amp;lt;mon&amp;gt;\d\d)/(?&amp;lt;day&amp;gt;\d\d)/(?&amp;lt;year&amp;gt;\d\d\d\d)';
$fmt3 = '(?&amp;lt;day&amp;gt;\d\d)\.(?&amp;lt;mon&amp;gt;\d\d)\.(?&amp;lt;year&amp;gt;\d\d\d\d)';

for my $d qw( 2006-10-21 15.01.2007 10/31/2005 ){
    if ( $d =~ m{$fmt1|$fmt2|$fmt3} ){
        print "day=$+{day} month=$+{mon} year=$+{year}\n";
    }
}

prints:

day=21 month=10 year=2006
day=15 month=01 year=2007
day=31 month=10 year=2005
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any of the alternatives matches, the hash &lt;code&gt;%+&lt;/code&gt; is bound to contain the three key-value pairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6"&gt;Perl 6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we take the number matching Regex from above and convert it to a &lt;a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/design/syn/S05.html"&gt;Perl 6 Grammar&lt;/a&gt;, it becomes even easier to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Perl 6&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;grammar Date {
  rule year{  \d{4}   }
  rule day{   \d{1,2} }
  rule month{ \d{1,2} }

  rule ymd{ &amp;lt;year&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;month&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;day&amp;gt; }
  rule mdy{ &amp;lt;month&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;day&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;year&amp;gt; }
  rule dmy{ &amp;lt;day&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;month&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;year&amp;gt; }

  rule match{
     &amp;lt;(ymd)&amp;gt;
    |&amp;lt;(mdy)&amp;gt;
    |&amp;lt;(dmy)&amp;gt;
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I probably have some mistakes in this last bit of code, due to the Perl 6 design changing, and because I also haven't written a lot of Perl 6 code yet. It is also a bit of a contrived example&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would also need to change the for loop also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for [qw( 2006-10-21 15.01.2007 10/31/2005 )] -&amp;gt; $d {
    if ( $d =~ Date.match ){
        print "day=$&amp;lt;day&amp;gt; month=$&amp;lt;mon&amp;gt; year=$&amp;lt;year&amp;gt;\n";
    }
}

prints:

day=21 month=10 year=2006
day=15 month=01 year=2007
day=31 month=10 year=2005
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Well, I learned a trick when programming in WinForms when I read &lt;a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/writing/wfbook/"&gt;Chris Sell's book&lt;/a&gt;.  This trick uses logic that is already available to us in the framework.  I don't know about you, but when I learn about stuff I can reuse in the framework, that is usually the route I take instead of reinventing the wheel.  Unless of course it doesn't do everything I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got into WPF, I came up with a way to use that same code, but in a WPF application.  This solution should meet your needs based off your question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we need to create our application class.  In this class we are going override the OnStartup event and create a method called Activate, which will be used later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class SingleInstanceApplication : System.Windows.Application
{
    protected override void OnStartup(System.Windows.StartupEventArgs e)
    {
        // Call the OnStartup event on our base class
        base.OnStartup(e);

        // Create our MainWindow and show it
        MainWindow window = new MainWindow();
        window.Show();
    }

    public void Activate()
    {
        // Reactivate the main window
        MainWindow.Activate();
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we will need to create a class that can manage our instances.  Before we go through that, we are actually going to reuse some code that is in the Microsoft.VisualBasic assembly.  Since, I am using C# in this example, I had to make a reference to the assembly.  If you are using VB.NET, you don't have to do anything.  The class we are going to use is WindowsFormsApplicationBase and inherit our instance manager off of it and then leverage properties and events to handle the single instancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class SingleInstanceManager : Microsoft.VisualBasic.ApplicationServices.WindowsFormsApplicationBase
{
    private SingleInstanceApplication _application;
    private System.Collections.ObjectModel.ReadOnlyCollection&amp;lt;string&amp;gt; _commandLine;

    public SingleInstanceManager()
    {
        IsSingleInstance = true;
    }

    protected override bool OnStartup(Microsoft.VisualBasic.ApplicationServices.StartupEventArgs eventArgs)
    {
        // First time _application is launched
        _commandLine = eventArgs.CommandLine;
        _application = new SingleInstanceApplication();
        _application.Run();
        return false;
    }

    protected override void OnStartupNextInstance(StartupNextInstanceEventArgs eventArgs)
    {
        // Subsequent launches
        base.OnStartupNextInstance(eventArgs);
        _commandLine = eventArgs.CommandLine;
        _application.Activate();
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, we are using the VB bits to detect single instance's and process accordingly.  OnStartup will be fired when the first instance loads.  OnStartupNextInstance is fired when the application is re-run again.  As you can see, I can get to what was passed on the command line through the event arguments.  I set the value to an instance field.  You could parse the command line here, or you could pass it to your application through the constructor and the call to the Activate method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, it's time to create our EntryPoint.  Instead of newing up the application like you would normally do, we are going to take advantage of our SingleInstanceManager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class EntryPoint
{
    [STAThread]
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        SingleInstanceManager manager = new SingleInstanceManager();
        manager.Run(args);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I hope you are able to follow everything and be able use this implementation and make it your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wholeheartedly agree with you about state machines in WF - they aren't testable, are too complicated, the threading model is peculiar and hard to follow, and I'm not sure a visual designer could have been more poorly conceived for designing state machines graphically. I think this may be because the state machine concept feels tacked onto the WF runtime, which was designed for sequential state machines, something WF does a much better job with, in my opinion. The problem is that state machines are really not the same animal as a sequential work flow, and should have been given a first class implementation of their own, because the warping of WF to make it seem to support them turned out to be more or less unsupportable, if not actually unusable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript files should load sequentially &lt;em&gt;and block&lt;/em&gt; so unless the scripts you are depending on are doing something unusual all you should need to do is load application.js after the other files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Moving changes between stream is really easy, just select the change, send it to the "change palette" and select the destination stream.  It guides you through all the files that need to be merged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The command-line utilities are great.  We've managed to script most of our release generation around it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrations for Visual Studio, Bugzilla, etc...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawbacks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As monjardin pointed out, the client GUI can be slow. I use the windows version for all my history/stream searching since it's much faster than the X11 one.  Of course, the GUI's  written in Java so performance obviously wasn't their first concern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's starting to get slow for really large databases (I'm talking over 300,000 LOC), although they've apparently addressed it in today's release of 4.7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We opted to go with the cheaper license and not get the change packages feature (I can't see them working that well anyways, as the entire idea of promoting individual changes flies in the face of continuous integration).  So far it hasn't hurt us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, for the price you pay it's a nice tool.  We evaluated ClearCase, MKS, Spectrum and Subversion during our trial period.  Subversion may have been a good choice, but it was still pretty green when we were evaluating.  I've never heard of Plastic before, but I regret not evaluating Perforce.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I understand that the engineers over at Trolltech (makers of Qt) have recently switched to git.  I'd be interested in checking that out as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that said, an algorithm that should work would be to determine a minimum volume (amplitude) threshold and duration (say, &amp;lt;10dbA for more than 2 seconds) and then simply do a volume analysis of the waveform looking for areas that meet this criteria (with perhaps some filters for millisecond spikes).

&lt;p&gt;The "magic" here lies in the operating system. Both programs do start up at roughly the same time, and run at the same time (the operating system assigns them slices of time on the processor to run) as every other simultaneously running process on your computer (including the terminal application and the kernel). So, before any data gets passed, the processes are doing whatever initialization necessary. In your example, tail is parsing the '-20' argument and cat is parsing the 'file.txt' argument and opening the file. At some point tail will get to the point where it needs input and it will tell the operating system that it is waiting for input. At some other point (either before or after, it doesn't matter) cat will start passing data to the operating system using stdout. This goes into a buffer in the operating system. The next time tail gets a time slice on the processor after some data has been put into the buffer by cat, it will retrieve some amount of that data (or all of it) which leaves the buffer on the operating system. When the buffer is empty, at some point tail will have to wait for cat to output more data. If cat is outputting data much faster than tail is handling it, the buffer will expand. cat will eventually be done outputting data, but tail will still be processing, so cat will close and tail will process all remaining data in the buffer. The operating system will signal tail when their is no more incoming data with an EOF. Tail will process the remaining data. In this case, tail is probably just receiving all the data into a circular buffer of 20 lines, and when it is signalled by the operating system that there is no more incoming data, it then dumps the last twenty lines to its own stdout, which just gets displayed in the terminal. Since tail is a much simpler program than cat, it will likely spend most of the time waiting for cat to put data into the buffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a system with multiple processors, the two programs will not just be sharing alternating time slices on the same processor core, but likely running at the same time on separate cores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get into a little more detail, if you open some kind of process monitor (operating system specific) like 'top' in Linux you will see a whole list of running processes, most of which are effectively using 0% of the processor. Most applications, unless they are crunching data, spend most of their time doing nothing. This is good, because it allows other processes to have unfettered access to the processor according to their needs. This is accomplished in basically three ways. A process could get to a sleep(n) style instruction where it basically tells the kernel to wait n milliseconds before giving it another time slice to work with. Most commonly a program needs to wait for something from another program, like 'tail' waiting for more data to enter the buffer. In this case the operating system will wake up the process when more data is available. Lastly, the kernel can preempt a process in the middle of execution, giving some processor time slices to other processes. 'cat' and 'tail' are simple programs. In this example, tail spends most of it's time waiting for more data on the buffer, and cat spends most of it's time waiting for the operating system to retrieve data from the harddrive. The bottleneck is the speed (or slowness) of the physical medium that the file is stored on. That perceptible delay you might detect when you run this command for the first time is the time it takes for the read heads on the disk drive to seek to the position on the harddrive where 'file.txt' is. If you run the command a second time, the operating system will likely have the contents of file.txt cached in memory, and you will not likely see any perceptible delay (unless file.txt is very large, or the file is no longer cached.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most operations you do on your computer are IO bound, which is to say that you are usually waiting for data to come from your harddrive, or from a network device, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GOTO is just a more explicit flow control statement like any other. Let's say you have some nested loops and you only need to find one thing. You can put in a conditional statement (or several) and when conditions are met properly, you can use a GOTO statement to get out of all the loops, (instead of having a 'break' statement at each level of nesting with a conditional statement for each. And yes, I believe the traditional implementation is to have named labels that the GOTO statement can jump to by name. You can do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for(...) {
    for (...) {
        for (...) {
        // some code
        if (x) GOTO outside;
        }
    }
} 
:outside
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a simpler (and more efficient) implementation than without GOTO statements. The equivalent would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for(...) {
    for (...) {
        for (...) {
            // some code
            if (x) break;
        }
        if(x) break;
    }
    if(x) break;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second case (which is common practice) there are three conditional statements, which is obviously slower than just having one. So, for optimization/simplification reasons, you might want to use GOTO statements in tightly nested loops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;work, but they need a sequential scan of all the table (because the random value associated with each row needs to be calculated - so that the smallest one can be determined), which can be quite slow for even medium sized tables. My recommendation would be to use some kind of indexed numeric column (many tables have these as their primary keys), and then write something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM table WHERE num_value &amp;gt;= RAND() *

&lt;p&gt;This works in logarithmic time, regardless of the table size, if &lt;code&gt;num_value&lt;/code&gt; is indexed. One caveat: this assumes that &lt;code&gt;num_value&lt;/code&gt; is equally distributed in the range &lt;code&gt;0..MAX(num_value)&lt;/code&gt;. If your dataset strongly deviates from this assumption, you will get skewed results (some rows will appear more often than others).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In C++ you have pointers, which are more powerful (or less powerful depending on your interpretation of power) object references, which you already know about from Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Java you might do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Thing mything = new Thing(); // mything is an object reference
mything.method();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In C++ you would do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Thing * mything = new Thing(); // mything is an object pointer
mything-&amp;gt;method();
delete mything;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The syntactical difference is obvious: '-&gt;' instead of '.' when calling an object method from a pointer to an object. In C++, you have to free the memory explicitly when you are done with an object. At the end of the day you are doing the same thing in C++ and Java, instantiating objects and calling methods, putting useless semicolons at the end of every line, etc. Is it any wonder that Python is becoming so popular?:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mything = Thing() # mything is whatever I want it to be
mything.method()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skimming through any half decent C++ text will help you fill in the rest of the details.&lt;/p&gt;

I have been thinking about how I can ensure all future child classes are serializable to XML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, obviously I could implement the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.serialization.ixmlserializable.aspx"&gt;IXmlSerializable&lt;/a&gt; interface and then chuck a reader/writer to it but I would like to avoid that since it then means I need to instantiate a reader/writer whenever I want to do it, and 99.99% of the time I am going to be working with a &lt;em&gt;string&lt;/em&gt; so I may just write my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, to serialize to XML, I am simply decorating the class and its members with the &lt;em&gt;Xml???&lt;/em&gt; attributes ( &lt;em&gt;XmlRoot&lt;/em&gt; , &lt;em&gt;XmlElement&lt;/em&gt; etc.) and then passing it to the &lt;em&gt;XmlSerializer&lt;/em&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;StringWriter&lt;/em&gt; to get the string. Which is all good. I intend to put the method to return the string into a generic utility method so I dont need to worry about type etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The this that concerns me is this: If I do not decorate the class(es) with the required attributes an error is not thrown until run time..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there any way to enforce attribute decoration? Can this be done with FxCop?&lt;/strong&gt; (I have not used FxCop yet)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, the manual states that When using the libmysqld embedded server, the memory benefits are essentially lost when retrieving results row by row because "memory usage incrementally increases with each row retrieved until mysql&lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt;result() is called."

You can't assume that register values will be unmodified after calling a subroutine. In fact, it's best to assume they will be modified, else the subroutine wouldn't be able to do it's work (at least for low register count architectures like x86). If you want to preserve a value you should store it in memory (e.g. push it onto the stack and keep track of it's location).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll need to do the same for any other variable you have. Using registers to store local variables is pretty much reserved to architectures with enough registers to support it (e.g. EPIC, amd64, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When writing secure code, it's almost always incorrect to "check, then do" anything.  The reason is that between the checking whether you can do something and actually doing it, the state of the system could change such that doing it would have a different result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you check whether a file exists before writing one, don't check whether you wrote the file successfully (or don't check in a detailed-enough fashion), and then later depend on the contents of the file you wrote, you could actually be reading a file written by an attacker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead of checking file permissions, just do whatever it was you were going to do if the permissions check succeeded, and handle errors gracefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think it is a Bad Thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My reasons are thrice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It circumvents my well architectured MVP framework - with databinding, the view communicates bi-directionally with a model.  Ewww.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It promotes hooking up view controls to datafields at design time.  In my experience, this leads to vital code (binding column A to Field X) being obscure and hidden away in some designer file.  IMO this code should be explicit and in-your-face, so that it is easy to modify and see what is going on, without having to use a clunky designer interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relating to Point #1 this direct binding makes it harder to isolate each component (view, model, controller/presenter) and unit-test.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pros are that it is easy to set up, and you can take advantage of some nice features (validation etc) which come with the plumbing already done for you.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for me, databinding becomes much more of a hindrance when dealing with a large data-centric application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off all, I agree with you! But...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For enterprise level applications, then spending the extra time on the system architecture, modelling and standards will give you a robust and sustainable system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it will take longer to develop (or at least longer to get to an initial release) and this may not be appropriate for every system or every part of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you just need to "get it done and done quick".  For internal applications, back office systems and maintenance applications that are rarely used or very dynamic (the spec's change often) then there is little justification in building the Rolls Royce solution for this.  It's better to get the developer spending time on the CRITICAL part of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you have to avoid / prevent is using these "one click framework" solutions on the MISSION CRITICAL area's of the system where the big transaction rate area's and where data quality and integrity is critical.  Spend quality time shaving the milliseconds off on the most heavily used area's on the system!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've written a RewriteCond and RewriteRule to do this but it's not quite right and I can't figure out why.  The regular expression contains a negative lookahead for the string "/audio", but for some reason this isn't matching.  Here's the definition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(.*\.)?mydomain\.net(?!/audio) [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.newdomain.net [L,R=301]

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(i.e. put the forward slash outside of the negative lookahead part) then it works, but the downside of this is that requests to mydomain.net without a trailing slash will not be redirected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can anyone point out what I'm doing wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note: the angle brackets around the domain in the RewriteRule bit above are being added by StackOverflow.com -- they are not there in the actual code!)&lt;/p&gt;

ServerAdmin me@mydomain.net
DocumentRoot "/var/www/mydomain.net/htdocs"
ServerName www.mydomain.net

ErrorLog logs/error_log

&lt;p&gt;Thanks @mercutio -- that makes perfect sense but it still doesn't seem to work.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's what the mod_rewrite log says when I make a request to &lt;a href="http://mydomain.net/audio/something.mp3"&gt;http://mydomain.net/audio/something.mp3&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(2) init rewrite engine with requested uri /audio/something.mp3
(3) applying pattern '^(.*)$' to uri '/audio'
(2) rewrite '/audio' -&amp;gt; 'http://www.newdomain.net/'
(2) explicitly forcing redirect with http://www.newdomain.net
(1) escaping http://www.newdomain.net for redirect
(1) redirect to http://www.newdomain.net [REDIRECT/301]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the REQUEST_URI does start with &lt;code&gt;/audio&lt;/code&gt; I would expect the RewriteRule to be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All inter-application references target the /bin folder (we don't use bin/debug and bin/release, just bin, this way the references remain the same and we just change the release configuration depending on the build target).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cruise Control builds the core solution for any dependencies before building any other app, and because the 3rdPartAssemblies folder is present on the server we ensure developer machines and build server have the same development layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this buy you, as compared to just a JobMesssage and QuoteMessage table? It elevates a Message to a first class citizen, so that you can read all Messages from a single table. In exchange, your query path from a Message to it's relevant Quote or Job is 1 more join away. It kind of depends on your app flow whether that's a good tradeoff or not.&lt;/p&gt;

If the 2 things you're modeling have the same attributes (columns), but are actually different things (tables) - then it's reasonable to have multiple tables with similar schemas.

&lt;p&gt;What is the equivalent option in C#?
I read somewhere that "You don't want a destructor in your C# class"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the Dispose method of the IDisposable interface an option?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case there are no unmanaged resources to free.
Additionally, it is not determined &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; the GC will dispose the object.
When it eventually gets disposed, is it still possible to know where and when you ignored that specific Status instance?
The "using" keyword does help, but again, it is not &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; for lazy callers.&lt;/p&gt;

One piece of advice I would give is to ensure that the system works &lt;em&gt;FULLY&lt;/em&gt; before chucking out your old 3.11 systems as I have been stung before! To fully perform the testing can cost more money then you might save, but its up to anyone who make the decisions to ensure that is considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some issues with MySQL, like that it doesn't respect foreign integrity constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm currently a fan of PostgreSQL, which is also freely available (and, I think if you read the licensing of MySQL, actually turns out to have a more amenable license for commercial use).  It seems to be higher performance than SQLite, which probably has more to do with it being run on an SMP machine, and making use to different threads.  It also seems to be quite solid.&lt;/p&gt;

Also, It is a lot more efficient to use return codes and check the status with an if statement rather than trhowing exceptions. If it really is an &lt;em&gt;Exceptional&lt;/em&gt; circumstance, then by all means throw away... but say if you failed to open a device, then it might be more prudent to stick with the return code.&lt;/p&gt;

The typical way to handle it is to wrap a try/catch around it. You can still ignore the status code in the catch block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could, however, have a parameter of Action&amp;lt; Status&gt; so that the caller is forced to pass a callback function that accepts a status and then checking to see if they called it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void MyFunction(Action&amp;lt;Status&amp;gt; callback)

                     : new Status(true, "OK");

   if (!status.isOkWasCalled) 
     throw new Exception("Please call IsOK() on Status"). 
 }

MyFunction(status =&amp;gt; if (!status.IsOK()) onerror());
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're worried about them calling IsOK() without doing anything, use Expression&amp;lt; Func&amp;lt; Status,bool&gt;&gt; instead and then you can analyse the lambda to see what they do with the status:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void MyFunction(Expression&amp;lt;Func&amp;lt;Status,bool&amp;gt;&amp;gt; callback)
 { if (!visitCallbackExpressionTreeAndCheckForIsOKHandlingPattern(callback))
     throw new Exception
                ("Please handle any error statuses in your callback");


   bool errorHappened = false;

   if (somethingBadHappend) errorHappened = true;

   Status status = (errorHappend)
                     ? new Status(false, "Something went wrong")
                     : new Status(true, "OK");

   callback.Compile()(status);
 }

MyFunction(status =&amp;gt; status.IsOK() ? true : onerror());
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or forego the status class altogether and make them pass in one delegate for success and another one for an error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void MyFunction(Action success, Action error)
 { if (somethingBadHappened) error(); else success();
 }

MyFunction(()=&amp;gt;;,()=&amp;gt;handleError());

&lt;p&gt;Strong opinion, but imho, you bring out all the wrong reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It circumvents my well architectured MVP framework - with databinding, the view communicates bi-directionally with a model. Ewww.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess it depends on the implementation of the data binding.
In the early years of my programming career, I used to do a lots of VBA for MS Access programming and Access forms had indeed this direct binding to tables/fields in database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the general purpose languages/frameworks have databinding as a separate component, do not use such a direct binding and are usually considered as a easy generic dropin for a controller in MVC pattern sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It promotes hooking up view controls to datafields at design time. In my experience, this leads to vital code (binding column A to Field X) being obscure and hidden away in some designer file. IMO this code should be explicit and in-your-face, so that it is easy to modify and see what is going on, without having to use a clunky designer interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess you are talking about the binding in WinForms?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience with win forms comes from a long ago, so I might be pretty out of date here.
It sure is a convenience feature, and I would strongly argue against it, unless you are writing really simple modal context CRUD style interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Relating to Point #1 this direct binding makes it harder to isolate each component (view, model, controller/presenter) and unit-test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again - assuming the view (a widget in WinFoms?) is tied together with databinding awareness, you are right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But for me, databinding becomes much more of a hindrance when dealing with a large data-centric application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite contrary - if data binding is implemented as an independent component (eg. bindings in Cocoa or JFace DataBinding, or JGoodies Binding), that acts as a controller between View and a Model, taking care of all the nitty-gritty of event handling and conversion and validation, then it is just so much more easier to use, change and replace than your custom controller code doing just the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only downside of a general purpose data binding framework is that if the binding is off and/or misconfigured, the interactions between bound pieces are just notoriously difficult to debug due to the level of abstraction inside the data binding code... So You better not make any mistakes! ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you want restartable copies (with such small file sizes, that doesn't seem like it'd be that big of a deal)? If so, look at &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa363852.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;CopyFileEx with COPYFILERESTARTABLE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you want verifiable copies? Sounds like you already have that by verifying hashes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you want better performance? It's going to be tough, as it sounds like you can't run anything on the server. Otherwise, &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms740565%28VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;TransmitFile&lt;/a&gt; may help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you just want a fire and forget operation? I suppose shelling out to robocopy, or &lt;a href="http://www.codesector.com/teracopy.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;TeraCopy&lt;/a&gt; or something would work - but it seems a bit hacky to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you want to know when the network comes back? &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa377522%28VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;IsNetworkAlive&lt;/a&gt; has your answer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on what I know so far, I think the following pseudo-code would be my approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sourceFile = Compress("*.*");
destFile = "X:\files.zip";

int copyFlags = COPYFILEFAILIFEXISTS | COPYFILERESTARTABLE;
while (CopyFileEx(sourceFile, destFile, null, null, false, copyFlags) == 0) {
   do {
     // optionally, increment a failed counter to break out at some point
     Sleep(1000);
   while (!IsNetworkAlive(NETWORKALIVELAN));
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compressing the files first saves you the tracking of which files you've successfully copied, and which you need to restart. It should also make the copy go faster (smaller total file size, and larger single file size), at the expense of some CPU power on both sides. A simple batch file can decompress it on the server side.&lt;/p&gt;

Can an architecture be created agile in isolation? If we're looking at something like XP then I'm a little doubtful. Or maybe I've misunderstood, but that's never stopped me from expanding...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In XP, to take an approach I know more about, we're going to have some sort of structure within a very short time after we start a project; about the time the first story is complete, in fact. During the initial story-writing we'll have started to get some idea of what we might build - it's inevitable: programmers tend to think in terms of code. But thinking too far ahead takes us into &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Ain%27t_Gonna_Need_It" rel="nofollow"&gt;YAGNI&lt;/a&gt; territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kind of thought that much of the architecture of an application developed within an agile environment would be expected to be emergent through, in particular, constant and dedicated refactoring to remove duplication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So perhaps the question is as much to assess if there are particular characteristics - or classes of characteristics - that architectures evolved as a result of an agile process will tend to display. And then I think it's going to depend on what kind of app we're building, although some of the principles already mentioned (a couple of which I even understand) must be likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ian's answer (+1) is correct &lt;em&gt;[see note]&lt;/em&gt;.  Using a many to many table &lt;code&gt;QUOTEMESSAGE&lt;/code&gt; to join &lt;code&gt;QUOTE&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;MESSAGE&lt;/code&gt; is the most correct model, but will leave orphaned &lt;code&gt;MESSAGE&lt;/code&gt; records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of those &lt;em&gt;rare&lt;/em&gt; cases where a trigger can be used.  However, caution needs to be applied to ensure that the a single &lt;code&gt;MESSAGE&lt;/code&gt; record cannot be associated with both a &lt;code&gt;QUOTE&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;JOB&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;create trigger quotemessage_trg
on quotemessage
for delete
as
begin

delete 
from [message] 
where [message].[msg_id] in

&lt;p&gt;Using a new language in production code is about more than easy syntax and high-level capability. You want to be familiar with core APIs and feel like you can fix something through logic instead of having to comb through the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you'd really, really, really like to introduce Python, consider writing some extensions or utilities in straight-up Python or in the framework. You won't be upsetting your core initiatives, so it will be a low/no-risk opportunity to prove the merits of a switch.&lt;/p&gt;

I did this by waiting until there was a project for which I would be the only programmer, then getting permission to do this new project in Python.  I then did another small project in Python with similarly impressive results.  In addition, I used Python for all of my small throwaway assignments ("can you parse the stats in these files into a CSV file organized by date and site?", etc) and had a quick turnaround time on all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also evangelized Python a bit; I went out of my way to NOT be obnoxious about it, but I'd occasionally describe why I liked it so much, talked about the personal projects I use it for in my free time and why it's awesome for me, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we started another project and I convinced everyone to use Python for it.  I took care to point everyone to a lot of documentation, including the specific webpages relating to what they were working on, and every time they had a question, I'd explain how to do things properly by explaining the Pythonic approach to things, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has worked really well.  However, this might be somewhat different than what you're describing.  In my case I started with moderately small projects and Python is only being used for new projects.  Also, none of my co-workers were really Perl or PHP gurus; they all knew those languages and had been using them for awhile, but it didn't take much effort for them to become more productive in Python than they'd been before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you're talking about new projects with people who currently use PHP but aren't super-experts and don't love that language, then I think switching to Python is a no-brainer.  However, if you're talking about working with a large existing PHP code base with a lot of very experienced PHP programmers who are happy with their current setup, then switching languages is probably not a good idea.  You're probably somewhere in between, so you'll have to weigh the tradeoffs; hopefully my answer will help you do that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It will be nice to know; what can
  cause or causes a StackOverflowError
  during compilation of Java code?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is probable that evaluating the long expression in your java file consumes lots of memory and because this is being done in conjunction with the compilation of other classes, the VM just runs out of stack space. Your generated class is perhaps pushing the legal limits for its contents. See chapter &lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jvms/second_edition/html/ClassFile.doc.html#88659" rel="nofollow"&gt;4.10 Limitations of the Java Virtual Machine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jvms/" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Java Virtual Machine Specification, Second Edition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix 1: refactor the class&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since your class is being generated, this might not be an option. Still, it is worth looking at the options your class generation tool offers to see if it can produce something less troublesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix 2: increase the stack size&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16935/ants-javac-tasks-throws-stackoverflowexception#16982" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kieron&lt;/a&gt; has one solution when he mentions the -Xss argument. &lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javac.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;javac&lt;/a&gt; takes a number of non-standard arguments that will vary between versions and compiler vendors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My compiler:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ javac -version
javac 1.6.0_05
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To list all the options for it, I'd use these commands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;javac -help
javac -X
javac -J-X
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; the stack limit for javac is 512Kb by default. You can increase the stack size for this compiler to 10Mb with this command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;javac -J-Xss10M Foo.java
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Javascript isn't just a simple scripting language; its a complex and surprisingly powerful programming language that is closely linked to the HTML DOM, which is implemented differently in different browsers.  If you do it wrong, you will not only leak memory but also throw errors everywhere and generally make the browsing experience awful.  Do you want to drive away the people coming to your website?

C# just can't do some of the things C++ can. However, a somewhat ugly way to get a similar effect is the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;using System;

public class Example

    public delegate void ToyUseCallback(Toy toy);

    public class Parent
    {
        public static void RequestToy(ToyUseCallback callback)
        {
            Toy toy = new Toy();
            callback(toy);
            if (!toy.IsInCupboard)
            {
                throw new Exception("You didn't put your toy in the cupboard!");
            }
        }
    }

    public class Child
    {
        public static void Play()
        {
            Parent.RequestToy(delegate(Toy toy)
            {
                toy.Play();
                // Oops! Forgot to put the toy away!
            });
        }
    }

    public static void Main()
    {
        Child.Play();
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the very simple example, you get an instance of Toy by calling Parent.RequestToy, &lt;em&gt;and passing it a delegate&lt;/em&gt;. Instead of returning the toy, the method immediately calls the delegate with the toy, which must call PutAway before it returns, or the RequestToy method will throw an exception. I make no claims as to the wisdom of using this technique -- indeed in all "something went wrong" examples an exception is almost certainly a better bet -- but I think it comes about as close as you can get to your original request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A GUI and a CLI are two different interfaces used to access an underlying implementation.  They are generally used for different purposes (GUI is for a live user, CLI is usually accessed by scripting) and can often have different requirements.  Coupling the two together is not a wise choice and is bound to cause you trouble down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way you've described things, you need to spawn an executable every time the GUI needs to d o something.  This is just plain ugly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right way to do this is to put the implementation in a library that's called by both the CLI and the GUI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thank you all for your answers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I think the try - catch phrase is the most elegant, I know from my experience with vb that it can really be a bummer. I used it once and it took about 30 minutes to run a program, which later on only took 2 minutes to compute just because I avoided try - catch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I chose the swich statement as the best answer. It makes the code more complicated but on the other hand I imagine it to be relatively fast and relatively easy to read. (Though I still think there should be a more elegant way ... maybe in the next language I learn :P )&lt;/p&gt;

Also, for display purposes you could run it through another similar function to ensure that the user always sees the number format they are comfortable with.  The key here is to switch it to a decimal as soon as you get it from the user, and only switch it back to a string at the last step before sending it out to the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Jason - I guess my point is that if any sort of ad-hoc analysis (i.e. trending) needs to be done on the data by business people, rolling up or archiving the data to text files really doesn't solve any problems.  Of course writing code to consume a text file is easy in many languages, but that problem has been solved.  Also, I would argue that today's RDBMS's are all extremely durable when setup and maintained properly.  If they weren't why would you run a business on top of one (let alone archive data to it)?  I just don't see the point of archiving to a plain text file because of the claim that durability of text files is superior to that of databases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sidebar:&lt;/strong&gt; Usually databases are set up to store money amounts using either the &lt;strong&gt;decimal&lt;/strong&gt; data type (also called &lt;strong&gt;money&lt;/strong&gt; in some DBs), or as a floating point number (also called &lt;strong&gt;double&lt;/strong&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The difference is that when it's stored as &lt;strong&gt;decimal&lt;/strong&gt; certain numbers like 0.01 are represented exactly whereas in &lt;strong&gt;double&lt;/strong&gt; those numbers can only be stored approximately, causing rounding errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The database &lt;em&gt;appears&lt;/em&gt; to be storing the number as &lt;code&gt;"1000.00"&lt;/code&gt; because something is formatting it for display. In VB6, there's a function &lt;code&gt;FormatCurrency&lt;/code&gt; which would take a number like 1000 and return a string like &lt;code&gt;"1000.00"&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll notice that the &lt;code&gt;FormatCurrency&lt;/code&gt; function does not take an argument specifying what type of currency to use. That's because it, along with all the other locale-specific functions in VB, figures out the currency from the current locale of the system (from the Windows Control Panel). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means that on my system, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Debug.Print FormatCurrency(1000)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;will print &lt;code&gt;$1,000.00&lt;/code&gt;, but if I run that same program on a Windows computer set to the UK locale, it will probably print &lt;code&gt;1,000.00&lt;/code&gt;, which, of course, is something completely different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, you've got some code, somewhere, I can't tell where, in Poland, it seems, that is responsible for parsing the user's string and converting it to a number. And if that code is in Visual Basic, again, it's relying on the control panel to decide whether "." or "," is the thousands separator and whether "," or "." is the decimal point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function &lt;code&gt;CDbl&lt;/code&gt; converts its argument to a number. So for example on my system in the US&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Debug.Print CDbl("1.200")&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;produces the number one point two, on a system with the Control Panel set to European formatting, it would produce the number one thousand, two hundred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's possible that the problem is that you have someone sitting a computer with the regional control panel set to use "." as the decimal separator, but they're typing "," as the decimal separator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Any new platform is risky compared to staying with the tried and true&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, if this developer is excited about python, stopping them outright is probably demoralizing. My suggestion would be to encourage them to develop in python, but not the mission critical parts of the app. Instead they could write some utility scripts, some small internal application that needs doing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

and R=9  (Dont worry about call inside a loop. Its considered as a single call)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calculating M is easy. Load C using classloader and use reflection to get the count of methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calculating R is not direct. We need to count the number of method calls from the class. First level only. &lt;/p&gt;

[variable_name].[method_name]([zero or more parameters])

or  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
[variable_name].[method_name]([zero or more parameters]).method2();

&lt;p&gt;A hack I tried in the past (for something totally unrelated) was starting a process and constantly detecting if its main windows was created. As soon as it was created, I was hiding it. You could do this with the main module of the faulty application and hope it will be fast enough to hide the window before the user notices. Then you instanciate your component; the component will &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; recycle an existing process, hopefuly the one with the hidden main window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@question in the post:
Diffing the outputs would only show formatting changes if the &lt;em&gt;relative&lt;/em&gt; positions had changed.  For example, if i had this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;before:
First name, last name, addresss&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;after:
Last Name, First Name, Address&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then that would show up as a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if I had just bumped the address column over a few pixels, or changed it from plain text to bold, then you are right, that would not show up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option is to ensure that the object you send in is a convertible object by restraining the type to IConvertible (all primitive types implement IConvertible). This would allow you to convert your parameter to the given type very flexibly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Class test&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;

    }
}

&lt;p&gt;You could also do a variation on this by using an 'object' type instead like you had originally.&lt;/p&gt;

{

        }

The first is for user avatars in the user class.
The second is to allow file attachments (PDFs, etc) in a messaging system.
My question is what the best use practice would be in these situations to remain DRY, clear, and consistent.
Clearly it would make no sense to define and execute the plugin in both classes, but there's something deeply strange to me (possibly unfounded) about just going ahead and setting it all up in the godly Application class.
Is there something in between, or is the parent class the way to go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One is using a tree structure just as the previous one. The drawback of this structure is that you need a ton of tweaking/hacks to get the multi-module reporting work well with Maven. Another downside is that in Subversion the standard trunk/tags/branches approach add even more complexity to the repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other approach uses a flat structure, where there are only one parent project and all the modules, submodules and parts-of-the-submodules are a direct child of the parent project. This approach works well for reporting and is easier in Subversion, however I feel I lose a bit of the structure this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which way would you choose in the long term and why?&lt;/p&gt;

        Console.WriteLine(Test&amp;lt;float&amp;gt;.method1("23.4"));
        Console.WriteLine(Test&amp;lt;long&amp;gt;.method1("99999999999999"));
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a static dictionary holding a delegate for the TryParse method of every type I might want to use. I then wrote a generic method to look up the dictionary and pass on the call to the appropriate delegate. Since every delegate has a different type, I just store them as object references and cast them back to the appropriate generic type when I retrieve them. Note that for the sake of a simple example I have omitted error checking, such as to check whether we have an entry in the dictionary for the given type.&lt;/p&gt;

For those that don't know (probably everyone), Project Darkstar is a framework for massively multiplayer online games that attempts to take care of all of the "hard stuff."  The basic idea is that you write your game server logic in such a way that all operations are broken up into tiny tasks.  You pass these tasks to the Project Darkstar framework which handles distributing them to a specific node in the cluster, any concurrency issues, and finally persisting the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently doing this kind of thing is a much different problem for video games than it is for enterprise applications.  Jim Waldo, who gave the lecture, claims that MMO games have a DB read/write ratio of 50/50, whereas enterprise apps are more like 90% read, 10% write.  He also claims that most existing MMOs keep everything in memory exlcusively, and only dump to a DB every 6 hours of so.  This means if a server goes down, you would lose all of the work since the last DB dump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the project itself sounds really cool, but I don't think the industry will accept it.  First, you have to write your server code in Java.  The client code can be written in anything (Jim claims ActionScript 3 is the most popular, follow by C++), but the server stuff has to be Java.  Sounds good to me, but I really get the impression that everyone in the games industry hates Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, unlike other industries where developers prefer to use existing frameworks and libraries, the guys in the games industry seem to like to write everything themselves.  Not only that, they like to rewrite everything for every new game they produce.  Things are starting to change where developers are using Havok for physics, Unreal Engine 3 as their platform, etc., but for the most part it looks like everything is still proprietary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, are the guys at Project Darkstar just wasting their time?  Can a general framework like this really work for complex games with the performance that is required?  Even if it does work, are game companies willing to use it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attached the profiler, set up a trace profile using &lt;a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/sql/learn-sql-server/how-to-track-down-deadlocks-using-sql-server-2005-profiler/"&gt;this excellent article on troubleshooting deadlocks&lt;/a&gt;, and captured a bunch of examples. The weird thing is that &lt;strong&gt;the deadlocking write is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; the same&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;UPDATE [dbo].[Posts]
SET [AnswerCount] = @p1, [LastActivityDate] = @p2, [LastActivityUserId] = @p3
WHERE [Id] = @p0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other deadlocking statement varies, but it's usually some kind of trivial, simple &lt;strong&gt;read&lt;/strong&gt; of the posts table. This one always gets killed in the deadlock. Here's an example&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT
[t0].[Id], [t0].[PostTypeId], [t0].[Score], [t0].[Views], [t0].[AnswerCount], 
[t0].[AcceptedAnswerId], [t0].[IsLocked], [t0].[IsLockedEdit], [t0].[ParentId], 
[t0].[CurrentRevisionId], [t0].[FirstRevisionId], [t0].[LockedReason],
[t0].[LastActivityDate], [t0].[LastActivityUserId]
FROM [dbo].[Posts] AS [t0]
WHERE [t0].[ParentId] = @p0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be perfectly clear, we are not seeing write / write deadlocks, but read / write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a mixture of LINQ and parameterized SQL queries at the moment. We have added &lt;code&gt;with (nolock)&lt;/code&gt; to all the SQL queries. This may have helped some. We also had a single (very) poorly-written badge query that I fixed yesterday, which was taking upwards of 20 seconds to run every time, and was running every minute on top of that. I was hoping this was the source of some of the locking problems!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I got another deadlock error about 2 hours ago. Same exact symptoms, same exact culprit write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truly strange thing is that the locking write SQL statement you see above is part of a very specific code path. It's &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; executed when a new answer is added to a question -- it updates the parent question with the new answer count and last date/user. This is, obviously, not that common relative to the massive number of reads we are doing! As far as I can tell, we're not doing huge numbers of writes anywhere in the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that NOLOCK is sort of a giant hammer, but most of the queries we run here don't need to be that accurate. Will you care if your user profile is a few seconds out of date?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using NOLOCK with Linq is a bit more difficult as &lt;a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/GettingLINQToSQLAndLINQToEntitiesToUseNOLOCK.aspx"&gt;Scott Hanselman discusses here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are flirting with the idea of using&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on the base database context so that all our LINQ queries have this set. Without that, we'd have to wrap every LINQ call we make (well, the simple reading ones, which is the vast majority of them) in a 3-4 line transaction code block, which is ugly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I'm a little frustrated that trivial reads in SQL 2005 can deadlock on writes. I could see write/write deadlocks being a huge issue, but &lt;em&gt;reads?&lt;/em&gt; We're not running a banking site here, we don't need perfect accuracy every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideas? Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Are you instantiating a new LINQ to SQL DataContext object for every operation or are you perhaps sharing the same static context for all your calls?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeremy, we are sharing one static datacontext in the base Controller for the most part:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;private DBContext _db;
/// &amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;
/// Gets the DataContext to be used by a Request's controllers.
/// &amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;
public DBContext DB
{
    get
    {
        if (_db == null)
        {
            _db = new DBContext() { SessionName = GetType().Name };
            //_db.ExecuteCommand("SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED");
        }
        return _db;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you recommend we create a new context for every Controller, or per Page, or .. more often?&lt;/p&gt;

The most important things you need to learn, as a project manager, are the things you're going to be questioning your underlings about later. For example, my PM (also a PHP guy) has absolutely no knowledge of garbage collection and its implications, which makes it incredibly difficult for me to explain to him why our .NET Windows service appears to be taking 80MB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, you are not the one who needs to know everything. You should be issuing overarching directives, and let the people with the expertise sort out the details. That said, study up on the technicals a bit so that they can communicate effectively with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit (8/24/08):You should know something about the underlying technicals; not necessarily all .NET stuff either (garbage collection, .config files, pipes and services if you're running services adjacent to your project's main focus, stuff like that). Higher-reaching concepts would probably include WPF (maybe Silverlight as well), LINQ (or your ORM of choice), as well as the Vista bridge and related bridging code if your project includes desktop apps at all. Those three things seem to be the focus for this round of .NET. Something else that's very important to have at least a passing knowledge of is the ways that .NET code can/must interoperate with native code: P/Invoke, Runtime Callable Wrapping and COM Callable Wrapping. There are still a lot of native things that don't have a .NET equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for resources, I'd highly recommend MSDN Magazine. They tend to preview upcoming technologies and tools well before average developers will ever see them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import getopt, sys

def main():
    try:
        opts, args = getopt.getopt(sys.argv[1:], "ho:v", ["help", "output="])

    verbose = False
    for o, a in opts:
        if o == "-v":
            verbose = True
        if o in ("-h", "--help"):
            usage()
            sys.exit()
        if o in ("-o", "--output"):
            output = a
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in a word, here is how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You've got two types of options. Those who are receiving arguments, and those who are
just like switches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sys.argv&lt;/code&gt; is pretty much your &lt;code&gt;char** argv&lt;/code&gt; in C. Like in C you skip the first element which is the name of your program and parse only the arguments : &lt;code&gt;sys.argv[1:]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Getopt.getopt&lt;/code&gt; will parse it according to the rule you give in argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;"ho:v"&lt;/code&gt; here describes the short arguments : &lt;code&gt;-ONELETTER&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; means that &lt;code&gt;-o&lt;/code&gt; accepts one argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally &lt;code&gt;["help", "output="]&lt;/code&gt; describes long arguments ( &lt;code&gt;--MORETHANONELETTER&lt;/code&gt; ).
The &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; after output once again means that output accepts one arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is a list of couple (option,argument)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an option doesn't accept any argument (like &lt;code&gt;--help&lt;/code&gt; here) the &lt;code&gt;arg&lt;/code&gt; part is an empty string.
You then usually want to loop on this list and test the option name as in the example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this helped you.&lt;/p&gt;

The code uses a temporary table to do some of its work, merging some rows from the original table together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logic is written as a &lt;a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/lpt/a/3136" rel="nofollow"&gt;pipelined table function&lt;/a&gt;, following the pattern from the linked article. The table function uses a &lt;code&gt;PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION&lt;/code&gt; declaration to permit the temporary table manipulation, and also accepts a cursor input parameter to restrict the denormalization to certain ID values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then created a view to query the table function, passing in all possible ID values as a cursor (other uses of the function will be more restrictive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question: is this all really necessary? Have I completely missed a much more simple way of accomplishing the same thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time I touch PL/SQL I get the impression that I'm typing way too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I'll add a sketch of the table I'm dealing with to give everyone an idea of the denormalization that I'm talking about. The table stores a history of employee jobs, each with an activation row, and (possibly) a termination row. It's possible for an employee to have multiple simultaneous jobs, as well as the same job over and over again in non-contiguous date ranges. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;| EMP_ID | JOB_ID | STATUS | EFF_DATE    | other columns...
|      1 |     10 | A      | 10-JAN-2008 |
|      2 |     11 | A      | 13-JAN-2008 |
|      1 |     12 | A      | 20-JAN-2008 |
|      2 |     11 | T      | 01-FEB-2008 |
|      1 |     10 | T      | 02-FEB-2008 |
|      2 |     11 | A      | 20-FEB-2008 |
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Querying that to figure out who is working when in what job is non-trivial. So, my denormalization function populates the temporary table with just the date ranges for each job, for any &lt;code&gt;EMP_ID&lt;/code&gt;s passed in though the cursor. Passing in &lt;code&gt;EMP_ID&lt;/code&gt;s 1 and 2 would produce the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;| EMP_ID | JOB_ID | START_DATE  | END_DATE    |
|      1 |     10 | 10-JAN-2008 | 02-FEB-2008 |
|      2 |     11 | 13-JAN-2008 | 01-FEB-2008 |
|      1 |     12 | 20-JAN-2008 |             |
|      2 |     11 | 20-FEB-2008 |             |
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;code&gt;END_DATE&lt;/code&gt; allows &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;s for jobs that don't have a predetermined termination date.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, this denormalized form is much, much easier to query, but creating it--so far as I can tell--requires a temporary table to store the intermediate results (e.g., job records for which the activation row has been found, but not the termination...yet). Using the pipelined table function to populate the temporary table and then return its rows is the only way I've figured out how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

But I have now run into a problem (quelle surprise!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem I have is that I have a collection, which is of a abstract base class type, which is populated by the concrete derived types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought it would be fine to just add the XML attributes to all of the classes involved and everything would be peachy. Sadly, thats not the case!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I have done some digging on Google and I now understand &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it's not working. In that &lt;strong&gt;the &lt;code&gt;XmlSerializer&lt;/code&gt; is in fact doing some clever reflection in order to serialize objects to/from XML, and since its based on the abstract type, it cannot figure out what the hell it's talking to&lt;/strong&gt;. Fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should look into using XAML for serializing your object graphs.  It is designed to do this, whereas XML serialization isn't.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Xaml serializer and deserializer handles generics without a problem, collections of base classes and interfaces as well (as long as the collections themselves implement &lt;code&gt;IList&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;IDictionary&lt;/code&gt;).  There are some caveats, such as marking your read only collection properties with the &lt;code&gt;DesignerSerializationAttribute&lt;/code&gt;, but reworking your code to handle these corner cases isn't that hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm looking for something like the &lt;code&gt;tempfile&lt;/code&gt; module in Python: A (preferably) secure way to open a file for writing to. This should be easy to delete when I'm done too...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems, .NET does not have the "batteries included" features of the &lt;code&gt;tempfile&lt;/code&gt; module, which not only creates the file, but returns the file descriptor (old school, I know...) to it along with the path. At the same time, it makes sure only the creating user can access the file and whatnot (&lt;code&gt;mkstemp()&lt;/code&gt; I think): &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/library/tempfile.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://docs.python.org/library/tempfile.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, yes, I can see that. But GetTempFileName does have a drawback: There is a race condition between when the file was created (upon call to GetTempFileName a 0-Byte file gets created) and when I get to open it (after return of GetTempFileName). This might be a security issue, although not for my current application...&lt;/p&gt;

I think it's similar to creating a new Connection object on every call with ADO. The overhead isn't as bad as you would think, since connection pooling will still be used anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just use a global static helper like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public static class AppData
{
    /// &amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;
    /// Gets a new database context
    /// &amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;
    public static CoreDataContext DB
    {
        get
        {
            var dataContext = new CoreDataContext
            {
                DeferredLoadingEnabled = true
            };
            return dataContext;
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then I do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var db = AppData.DB;

var results = from p in db.Posts where p.ID = id select p;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I would do the same thing for updates. Anyway, I don't have nearly as much traffic as you, but I was definitely getting some locking when I used a shared DataContext early on with just a handful of users. No guarantees, but it might be worth giving a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Then again, looking at your code, you are only sharing the data context for the lifetime of that particular controller instance, which basically seems fine unless it is somehow getting used concurrently by mutiple calls within the controller. In a thread on the topic, ScottGu said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Controllers only live for a single request - so at the end of processing a request they are garbage collected (which means the DataContext is collected)...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So anyway, that might not be it, but again it's probably worth a try, perhaps in conjunction with some load testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way this is done by interpreters or virtual machines is to have a &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt; structure or something similar, and not use the stack and registers directly. This structure keeps track of a stack and optionally some registers, if you're designing a register based VM. At least, that's the simplest way to do it (though slightly less performant than actually mapping things correctly).&lt;/p&gt;

public class ConcreteClassB : AbstractClass
{
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

I don't need to access any specific methods of ConcreteClassA or B from outside of the Abstract class. I only need the public methods my Abstract class provides. I don't really need to prevent the Concrete classes from being instantiated, I'm just trying to avoid it since they provide no new public interfaces, just different implementations of some very specific things internal to the abstract class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, the simplest solution is to &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20185/is-there-a-way-to-make-a-constructor-only-visible-to-a-parent-class-in-c#20200" rel="nofollow"&gt;make child classes as samjudson mentioned&lt;/a&gt;. I'd like to avoid this however since it would make my abstract class' file a lot bigger than I'd like it to be. I'd rather keep classes split out over a few files for organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I've seen in cases like this is creating per-server, per-user, or per-server/per-user dedicated credentials that only have access to the proxy from a specific IP.  It doesn't solve your core obfuscation problem but it mitigates the effects of someone seeing the password because it's worth so little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the latter option, we came up with a "reverse crypt" password encoding at work that we use for stuff like this.  It's only obfuscation because all the data needed to decode the pw is stored in the encoded string, but it prevents people from accidentally seeing passwords in plain text.  So you might, for instance, store one of the above passwords in this format, and then write a wrapper for apt that builds apt.conf dynamically, calls the real apt, and at exit deletes apt.conf.  You still end up with the pw in plaintext for a little while, but it minimizes the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;SQL is actually pretty close to language standard, so you may suffer from MySQL's dialect you already know&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MySQL quietly truncates varchars that exceed max length, whereas Pg complains - quick workaround is to have these columns as 'text' instead of 'varchar' and use triggers to truncate long lines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;double quotes are used instead of reverse apostrophes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boolean fields are compared using IS and IS NOT operators, however MySQL-compatible INT(1) with = and &amp;lt;&gt; is still possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is no REPLACE, use DELETE/INSERT combo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pg is pretty strict on enforcing foreign keys integrity, so don't forget to use ON DELETE CASCADE on references&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you use PHP with PDO, remember to pass a parameter to lastInsertId() method - it should be sequence name, which is created usually this way: [tablename]&lt;em&gt;[primarykeyname]&lt;/em&gt;seq&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that helps at least a bit. Have lots of fun playing with Postgres!&lt;/p&gt;

Having said that this way is a nice 'Hack', and good if the number and complexity of the concrete classes is low.&lt;/p&gt;

Needing to add &lt;strong&gt;WITH NOLOCK&lt;/strong&gt; everywhere is a sure sign that you have problems in your data layer. &lt;/p&gt;

Do you determine the count earlier in the transaction, or just pull it from an object? &lt;code&gt;AnswerCount = AnswerCount+1&lt;/code&gt; when a question is added is probably a better way to handle this.

You can also catch and retry deadlocked statements fairly easily if you want to handle them gracefully.&lt;/p&gt;

    As others have said, it is possible.
    However, if both the service and
    client use an object that has the
    exact same domain behavior on both
    sides, you probably didn't need a
    service in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lomax:&lt;/strong&gt;
  I have to disagree with this as it's a
  somewhat narrow comment. Using a
  webservice that can serialize domain
  objects to XML means that it makes it
  easy for clients that work with the
  same domain objects, but it also means
  that those clients are restricted to
  using that particular web service
  you've exposed and it also works in
  reverse by allowing other clients to
  have no knowledge of your domain
  objects but still interact with your
  service via XML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@ Lomax: You've described two scenarios. &lt;strong&gt;Scenario 1:&lt;/strong&gt; The client is rehydrating the xml message back into the exact same domain object. I consider this to be "returning an object". In my experience this is a bad choice and I'll explain this below. &lt;strong&gt;Scenario 2:&lt;/strong&gt; The client rehydrates the xml message into something other than the exact same domain object: I am 100% behind this, however I don't consider this to be returning a domain object. It's really sending a message or DTO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let me explain why true/pure/not DTO object serialization across a web service is &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; a bad idea. An assertion: in order to do this in the first place, you either have to be the owner of both the client and the service, or provide the client with a library to use so that they can rehydrate the object back into it's true type. The problem: This domain object as a type now exists in and belongs to two semi-related domains. Over time, behaviors may need to be added in one domain that make no sense in the other domain and this leads to pollution and potentially painful problems.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually default to scenario 2. I only use scenario 1 when there is an overwhelming reason to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologize for being so terse with my initial reply. I hope this clears things up to a degree as far as what my opinion is. Lomax, it would seem we half agree ;).&lt;/p&gt;

It's by no means terrible, but definitely can use some work; you all know what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been performing some refactorings since coming on to the project team about 6 months ago. Some of those refactorings are simple, Extract Method, Pull Method Up, etc. Some of the refactorings are more structural. The latter changes make me nervous as there isn't a comprehensive suite of unit tests to accompany every component. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole team is on board for the need to make structural changes through refactoring, but our Project Manager has expressed some concerns that we don't have adequate tests to make refactorings with the confidence that we aren't introducing regression bugs into the system. He would like us to write more tests first (against the existing architecture), then perform the refactorings. My argument is that the system's class structure is too tightly coupled to write adequate tests, and that using a more Test Driven approach while we perform our refactorings may be better. What I mean by this is not writing tests against the existing components, but writing tests for specific functional requirements, then refactoring existing code to meet those requirements. This will allow us to write tests that will probably have more longevity in the system, rather than writing a bunch of 'throw away' tests.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To me, the simplest solution is to
  make child classes as samjudson

  I'd like it to be. I'd rather keep
  classes split out over a few files for
  organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No problem, just use &lt;strong&gt;partial&lt;/strong&gt; keyword and you can split your inner classes into as many files as you wish. You don't have to keep it in the same file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previous answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's possible but only with reflection&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public abstract class AbstractClass
{
    public static AbstractClass MakeAbstractClass(string args)
    {
        if (args == "a")
            return (AbstractClass)Activator.CreateInstance(typeof(ConcreteClassA), true);
        if (args == "b")
            return (AbstractClass)Activator.CreateInstance(typeof(ConcreteClassB), true);
    }
}

public class ConcreteClassA : AbstractClass
{
    private ConcreteClassA()
    {
    }
}

public class ConcreteClassB : AbstractClass
{
    private ConcreteClassB()
    {
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and here is another pattern, without ugly &lt;strong&gt;MakeAbstractClass(string args)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public abstract class AbstractClass&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; where T : AbstractClass&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;
{
    public static T MakeAbstractClass()
    {
        T value = (T)Activator.CreateInstance(typeof(T), true);
        // your processing logic
        return value;
    }
}

public class ConcreteClassA : AbstractClass&amp;lt;ConcreteClassA&amp;gt;
{
    private ConcreteClassA()
    {
    }
}

public class ConcreteClassB : AbstractClass&amp;lt;ConcreteClassB&amp;gt;
{
    private ConcreteClassB()
    {
    }

&lt;p&gt;For an sort of "callcenter control panel" of a web app that involved updating agent and call-queue status for a live Callcenter we developed an in-house solution that works, but is far away from a library you could use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we did was to implement a small service on the server that talks to the phone-system, waits for new events and maintains a photograph of the situation. This service provides a small webserver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our web-clients connects over HTTP to this webserver and ask for the last photo (coded in XML), displays it and then goes again, asking for the new photo. The webserver at this point can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return the new photo, if there is one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Block the client for some seconds (30 in our setup) waiting for some event to ocurr and change the photograph. If no event was generated at that point, it returns the same photo, only to allow the connection to stay alive and not timeout the client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way, when clients polls, it get a response in 0 to 30 seconds max. If a new event was already generated it gets it immediately), otherwise it blocks until new event is generated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's basically polling, but it somewhat smart polling to not overheat the webserver. If Comet is not your answer, I'm sure this could be implemented using the same idea but using more extensively AJAX or coding in JSON for better results. This was designed pre-AJAX era, so there are lots of room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

If your repo is working on release branching, the trunk is &lt;strong&gt;meant&lt;/strong&gt; to be unstable, but maybe your policy stems from some really bad experience in the past. If you are doing feature branching, then you can have a rule that says no merge back to trunk without peer review. Doing diffs at that point should be quite efficient to review with a colleague and should remove the bottleneck. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But changing your branching strategy is no small thing. Good question...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Developers deliver completed features from their stream to a parent integration stream after code review.&lt;/li&gt;

One of them (that I recently left) has adopted pair programming and the check in comments note that the code was "pair reviewed". The product that's being worked on, however, is somewhat mature and the development process can tolerate the slowed productivity.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The division I currently work in follows the check-in early, check-in often model. We are developing a new product with relatively few engineers. Each of us monitors the check-in's through email notifications and reviews the interesting parts on an ad-hoc basis. My current team is pretty well seasoned, though, and I think we can get away without formal reviews due to the quality of the engineers working on the project.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer your question, as the previous poster suggested, pair programming is probably the best compromise. Personally, I'd rather get a good team together and let them check-in code as quickly as possible.

Please take that with a grain of salt, though; I'm a bit jaded by my current employer.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Causes Leaks  
Label label = new Label();  
this.Controls.Add(label);  
this.Controls.Remove(label);  

// Correct Code  
Label label = new Label();  
this.Controls.Add(label);  
this.Controls.Remove(label);  
label.Dispose();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: The idea is to list common pitfalls which are not too obvious (such as the above). Usually the notion is that memory leaks are not a big problem because of the garbage collector. Not like it used to be in C++.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great discussion guys, but let me clarify... by definition, if there is no reference left to an object in .NET, it will be Garbage Collected at some time. So that is not a way to induce memory leaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the managed environment, I would consider it a memory leak if you had an unintended reference to any object that you aren't aware of (hence the two examples in my question).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example I might declare an Attribute called: DisplayOrder so I can easily control in what order properties should appear in the UI. I could then append it to a class and write some GUI components that extract the attributes and order the UI elements appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class DisplayWrapper
{
    private UnderlyingClass underlyingObject;

    public DisplayWrapper(UnderlyingClass u)
    {
        underlyingObject = u;
    }

    [DisplayOrder(1)]
    public int SomeInt
    {
        get
        {
            return underlyingObject .SomeInt;
        }
    }

    [DisplayOrder(2)]
    public DateTime SomeDate
    {
        get
        {
            return underlyingObject .SomeDate;
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thereby ensuring that SomeInt is always displayed before SomeDate when working with my custom GUI components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, you'll see them most commonly used outside of the direct coding environment. For example the Windows Designer uses them extensively so it knows how to deal with custom made objects. Using the BrowsableAttribute like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Browsable(false)]
public SomeCustomType DontShowThisInTheDesigner
{
    get{/*do something*/}
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tells the designer not to list this in the available properties in the Properties window at design time for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; also use them for code-generation, pre-compile operations (such as Post-Sharp)  or run-time operations such as Reflection.Emit.
For example, you could write a bit of code for profiling that transparently wrapped every single call your code makes and times it. You could "opt-out" of the timing via an attribute that you place on particular methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public void SomeProfilingMethod(MethodInfo targetMethod, object target, params object[] args)
{
    bool time = true;
    foreach (Attribute a in target.GetCustomAttributes())
    {
        if (a.GetType() is NoTimingAttribute)
        {
            time = false;
            break;
        }
    }
    if (time)
    {
        StopWatch stopWatch = new StopWatch();
        stopWatch.Start();
        targetMethod.Invoke(target, args);
        stopWatch.Stop();
        HandleTimingOutput(targetMethod, stopWatch.Duration);
    }
    else
    {
        targetMethod.Invoke(target, args);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Declaring them is easy, just make a class that inherits from Attribute. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class DisplayOrderAttribute : Attribute
{
    private int order;

    public DisplayOrderAttribute(int order)
    {
        this.order = order;
    }

    public int Order
    {
        get { return order; }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And remember that when you use the attribute you can omit the suffix "attribute" the compiler will add that for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    );
CREATE TABLE tree (
    orig INT,

    FOREIGN KEY (orig,term) REFERENCES items (num,num)
    )
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each leaf in the tree, &lt;code&gt;items.tot&lt;/code&gt; is set by someone. For interior nodes, &lt;code&gt;items.tot&lt;/code&gt; needs to be the sum of it's children. Running the following query repeatedly would generate the desired result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;UPDATE items SET tot = (
    SELECT SUM(b.tot) FROM
        tree JOIN items AS b

&lt;p&gt;(note this actually doesn't work but that's beside the point)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assume that the database exists and the invariant are already satisfied. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the most practical way to update the DB while maintaining this requirement? Updates may move nodes around or alter the value of &lt;code&gt;tot&lt;/code&gt; on leaf nodes. It can be assumed that leaf nodes will stay as leaf nodes, interior nodes will stay as interior nodes and the whole thing will remain as a proper tree.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some thoughts I have had:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full Invalidation, after any update, recompute everything (Um... No)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a trigger on the items table to update the parent of any row that is updated
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This would be recursive (updates trigger updates, trigger updates, ...)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doesn't work, MySQL can't update the table that kicked off the trigger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a trigger to schedule an update of the parent of any row that is updated
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This would be iterative (get an item from the schedule, processing it schedules more items)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kicks this off? Trust client code to get it right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An advantage is that if the updates are ordered correctly fewer sums need to be computer. But that ordering is a complication in and of it's own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ideal solution would generalize to other "aggregating invariants"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FWIW I know this is "a bit overboard", but I'm doing this for fun (Fun: verb, Finding the impossible by doing it. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

This is often used in WinForms for example to hide controls from the toolbar, but can be implemented in your own application to enable instances of different classes to behave in specific ways. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by creating an attribute:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class, AllowMultiple=false, Inherited=true)]
public class SortOrderAttribute : Attribute
{
    public int SortOrder { get; set; }

    public SortOrderAttribute(int sortOrder)
    {
        this.SortOrder = sortOrder;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All attribute classes must have the suffix "Attribute" to be valid.&lt;br /&gt;
After this is done, create a class that uses the attribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[SortOrder(23)]
public class MyClass
{
    public MyClass()
    {
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can check a specific class' SortOrderAttribute (if it have one) by doing the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class MyInvestigatorClass
{
    public void InvestigateTheAttribute()
    {
        // Get the type object for the class that is using
        // the attribute.
        Type type = typeof(MyClass);

        // Get all custom attributes for the type.
        object[] attributes = type.GetCustomAttributes(
            typeof(SortOrderAttribute), true);

        // Now let's make sure that we got at least one attribute.
        if (attributes != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; attributes.Length &amp;gt; 0)
        {
            // Get the first attribute in the list of custom attributes
            // that is of the type "SortOrderAttribute". This should only
            // be one since we said "AllowMultiple=false".
            SortOrderAttribute attribute = 
                attributes[0] as SortOrderAttribute;

            // Now we can get the sort order for the class "MyClass".
            int sortOrder = attribute.SortOrder;
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is this: create a WhitespaceAndAtSymbolTokenizer and a WhitespaceAndAtSymbolAnalyzer, then recreate your index using this analyzer. Once you do this, a search for "@gmail.com" will return all gmail addresses, because it's seen as a separate word thanks to the Tokenizer we just created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the source code, it's actually very simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class WhitespaceAndAtSymbolTokenizer : CharTokenizer
{
    public WhitespaceAndAtSymbolTokenizer(TextReader input)
        : base(input)
    {
    }

    protected override bool IsTokenChar(char c)
    {
        // Make whitespace characters and the @ symbol be indicators of new words.
        return !(char.IsWhiteSpace(c) || c == '@');
    }
}


internal class WhitespaceAndAtSymbolAnalyzer : Analyzer
{
    public override TokenStream TokenStream(string fieldName, TextReader reader)
    {
        return new WhitespaceAndAtSymbolTokenizer(reader);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it! Now you just need to rebuild your index and do all searches using this new Analyzer. For example, to write documents to your index:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;IndexWriter index = new IndexWriter(indexDirectory, new WhitespaceAndAtSymbolAnalyzer());
index.AddDocument(myDocument);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performing searches should use the analyzer as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;IndexSearcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(indexDirectory);
Query query = new QueryParser("TheFieldNameToSearch", new WhitespaceAndAtSymbolAnalyzer()).Parse("@gmail.com");
Hits hits = query.Search(query);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

  FROM dbo.Card
       INNER JOIN @tblExclusiveCard ON dbo.Card.Id = @tblExclusiveCard.CardId
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to use this trick with a list of strings. But since I'm looking for a particular keyword, I am going to use the LIKE clause. So ideally I'm thinking I'd have my final query look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT Id, Name, Description
  FROM dbo.Card
       INNER JOIN @tblKeyword ON dbo.Card.Description LIKE '%' + @tblKeyword.Value + '%'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this possible/recommended?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a better way to do something like this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I'm putting wildcards on both ends of the clause is because there are "archfiend", "beast-warrior", "direct-damage" and "battle-damage" terms that are used in the card texts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm getting the impression that depending on the performance, I can either use the query I specified or use a full-text keyword search to accomplish the same task? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than having the server do a text index on the fields I want to text search, is there anything else I need to do?&lt;/p&gt;

These alternative revision control tools aren't likely to gain traction at work, but they're really useful for local commits or to be able to commit when the work repository is inaccessible (I'm offline, travelling, etc.)  And they still sync with the parent repository.&lt;/p&gt;

There is a list box which the user can drag from and drop onto the page to create an instance of the control. To populate the list box, I get the &lt;code&gt;ControlDescriptionAttribute&lt;/code&gt; for the control and fill out an entry in the list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// done for each control type
array &amp;lt;Object ^&amp;gt;
  // get all the custom attributes
  ^attributes = controltype-&amp;gt;GetCustomAttributes (true);

Type
  // this is the one we're interested in

// iterate over the custom attributes
for each (Object ^attribute in attributes)
{
  if (attributetype-&amp;gt;IsInstanceOfType (attribute))
  {
    ECMMainPageDisplay::ControlDescriptionAttribute
      ^description = safe_cast &amp;lt;ECMMainPageDisplay::ControlDescriptionAttribute ^&amp;gt; (attribute);

    // get the name and description and create an entry in the list
    ListViewItem
      ^item = gcnew ListViewItem (description-&amp;gt;Name);

    item-&amp;gt;Tag = controltype-&amp;gt;Name;
    item-&amp;gt;SubItems-&amp;gt;Add (description-&amp;gt;Description);

    mcontrols-&amp;gt;Items-&amp;gt;Add (item);
    break;
  }
}

However, every time I have used TDD in a web application, I have had the luxury of having full access to the web server.  That means that I can update the server then run my unit tests directly from the server.  My question is, if you are using a third party web host, how do you run your unit tests on them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could argue that if your app is designed well and your build process is sound and automated, that running unit tests on your production server isn't necessary, but personally I like the peace of mind in knowing that everything is still "green" after a major update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For everyone who has responded with "just test before you deploy" and "don't you have a staging server?", I understand where you're coming from.  I do have a staging server and a CI process set up.  My unit tests do run and I make sure they all pass before an an update to production.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that in a perfect world I wouldn't be concerned with this.  But I've seen it happen before.  If a file is left out of the update or a SQL script isn't run, the effects are immediately apparent when running your unit tests but can go unnoticed for quite some time without them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I'm asking here is if there is any way, if only to satisfy my own compulsive desires, to run a unit test on a server that I cannot install applications on or remote into (e.g. one which I will only have FTP access to in order to update files)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would recommend turning off parts of your program until you figure out what part is causing this. If your program is small and not doing much it might be that the project is corrupted and needs to get rebuilt. Make a new project from scratch and put your files and settings back in by hand.&lt;/p&gt;

You can set up functional testing driven by an automated tool like &lt;a href="http://selenium.openqa.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Selenium&lt;/a&gt; to test your app remotely via the web interface, but that's not really unit testing the sense that you're restricted to testing the system as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

It is true that an abstract class (or even a non-abstract class) can be used to establish an interface to your code, but proper interfaces (the ones you define with the keyword and that only contain method signatures) are just plain easier to sort through and read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I tend to use discretion when deciding whether or not to use an interface over a class. Sometimes I want default method implementations, or variables that will be common to all subclasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the point about multiple-interface implementation is a sound one, too. If you have a class that implements multiple interfaces, you can use an object of that class as different types in the same application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that your question is about PHP, though, makes things a bit more interesting. Typing to interfaces is still not incredibly necessary in PHP, where you can pretty much feed anything to any method, regardless of its type. You can statically type method parameters, but some of that is broken (String, I believe, causes some hiccups). Couple this with the fact that you can't type most other references, and there isn't much value in trying to force static typing in PHP (&lt;em&gt;at this point&lt;/em&gt;). And because of that, the value of interfaces &lt;em&gt;in PHP&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;at this point&lt;/em&gt; is far less than it is in more strongly-typed languages. They have the benefit of readability, but little else. Multiple-implementation isn't even beneficial, because you still have to declare the methods and give them bodies within the implementor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one hand, I see elegant code being something that's easy to read while simultaneously solving the problem at hand in the most efficient way possible. It seems like readable code often comes at the expense of, for example, creating several new variables in order to represent the data with which you're working. Depending on your platform (or depending on how picky you are), creating these variables could be considered to be a performance hit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, this brings up another perspective that I've often seen that defines beautiful code as code that succinctly and efficiently solves the given problem. It can be argued, though, that succinct code may come at the sake of readability and thus ultimately detracts from the attractiveness of the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally want to be able to write expressive, effective, and elegant code, but I often find myself debating if adding a couple of more variables to improve the readability of the code three months later really does improve (or pollute) the code.&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe not the answer you where looking for but I would advocate a schema change...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;proposed schema:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;create table name(
    nameID identity / int
   ,name varchar(50))

create table description(
    descID identity / int
   ,desc varchar(50)) --something reasonable and to make the most of it alwase lower case your values

create table nameDescJunc(
    nameID  int
    ,descID int)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will let you use index's without have to implement a bolt on solution, and keeps your data atomic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistency&lt;/strong&gt; - The code should follow a consistent underlying pattern and style. I don't want one execution path to go a completely different route to another similar execution path. They should share as much code as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Validation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to Project | Properties | Validation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;click on the ... button in the settings column of the validator you want to shut up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a rule to the &lt;em&gt;exclude group&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;code navigation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hold down &lt;kbd&gt;ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt; to make all variables, methods and classnames hyperlinks to their definitions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;alt&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;left&lt;/kbd&gt; to navigate back to where you clicked &lt;kbd&gt;ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   _totalEntries++;
  }

  dispatchEvent(new Event(FEED_PARSED));

    _totalEntries++;
   }

   dispatchEvent(new Event(FEED_PARSED));
  } else {
   trace ("xml not fully loaded, starting timer");
   var t:Timer = new Timer(300, 1);
   t.addEventListener(TimerEvent.TIMER_COMPLETE, loaded);
   t.start();
  }
 }

  e.target.removeEventListener(TimerEvent.TIMER_COMPLETE, loaded);
  e.target.stop();

  isDownloadComplete();
 }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll point out that since adding the code determining if &lt;code&gt;mainXMLLoader.bytesLoaded == mainXMLLoader.bytesLoaded&lt;/code&gt; I have not had an issue - that said, this bug is hard to reproduce so for all I know I haven't fixed anything, and instead just added useless code.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The CInt function converts an expression to type Integer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;CInt differs from the Fix and Int functions, which truncate, rather than round, the fractional part of a number. When the fractional part is exactly 0.5, the CInt function always rounds it to the nearest even number. For example, 0.5 rounds to 0, and 1.5 rounds to 2.&lt;/p&gt;

The project was made up of several web services, each with several functions, which was the front end for a complicated document processing/querying system.  Somewhere around 75k lines of code.  We used aspects for two relatively minor pieces of functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First was tracing application flow.  We created an aspect that ran before and after each function call to print out "entered 'function'" and "exited 'function'".  With the function selector thing (pointcut maybe?  I don't remember the right name) we were able to use this as a debugging tool, selecting only functions that we wanted to trace at a given time.  This was a really nice use for aspects in our project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing we did was application specific metrics.  We put aspects around our web service methods to capture timing, object information, etc. and dump the results in a database.  This was nice because we could capture this information, but still keep all of that capture code separate from the "real" code that did the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've read about some nice solutions that aspects can bring to the table, but I'm still not convinced that they can really do anything that you couldn't do (maybe better) with "normal" technology.  For example, I couldn't think of any major feature or functionality that any of our projects needed that couldn't be done just as easily without aspects - where I've found aspects useful are the kind of minor things that I've mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orthogonal concerns, like security, are best done with AOP-style interception. Whether that is done automatically (through something like a dependency injection container) or manually is unimportant to the end goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example: the "before/after" attributes in &lt;a href="http://www.codeplex.com/xunit"&gt;xUnit.net&lt;/a&gt; (an open source project I run) are a form of AOP-style method interception. You decorate your test methods with these attributes, and just before and after that test method runs, your code is called. It can be used for things like setting up a database and rolling back the results, changing the security context in which the test runs, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example: the filter attributes in &lt;a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc"&gt;ASP.NET MVC&lt;/a&gt; also act like specialized AOP-style method interceptors. One, for instance, allows you to say how unhandled errors should be treated, if they happen in your action method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many dependency injection containers, including Castle Windsor and Unity, support this behavior either "in the box" or through the use of extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, you can't get away from the n^2 nature of it easily, but you can do slightly better with the merge since you can bound the range to insert each element in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at all the lists you generate, they have the following form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(a[i], a[j]) | j&amp;gt;=i&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you flip it 90 degrees, you get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(a[i], a[j]) | i&amp;lt;=j&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the merge process should be taking two lists &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;i+1&lt;/code&gt; (which correspond to lists where the first member is always &lt;code&gt;a[i]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;a[i+1]&lt;/code&gt;), you can bound the range to insert element &lt;code&gt;(a[i + 1], a[j])&lt;/code&gt; into list &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; by the location of &lt;code&gt;(a[i], a[j])&lt;/code&gt; and the location of &lt;code&gt;(a[i + 1], a[j + 1])&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that you should merge in reverse in terms of &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt;. I don't know (yet) if you can leverage this across &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; as well, but it seems possible.&lt;/p&gt;

A variety of factors like the amount of investment in RSS prior to Atom, the relative ease in implementing RSS versus Atom, and 'marketing' all come into play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can, however, think of a few things that should be considered when choosing what syndication format to use in representing resources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atom is an official Internet standards track protocol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atom has a registered content media type for its feed and entry representations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without the use of syndication extensions Atom tends to be a more robust format, especially in the link relations arena.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Representing resources using Atom allows you to leverage the Atom Publishing Protocol (AtomPub) to provide a RESTful API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The RFC-3339 DateTime format used by Atom is easy to parse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is only one deprecated version of Atom (0.3) you might conceivably have to support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementing Atom typically takes more time to do correctly than RSS, as there are more restrictions and the technical specification can be a bit dense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RSS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RSS is a relatively simple format to implement in a short amount of time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are not as many constraints/rules placed on RSS as there are on Atom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RSS is not an official Internet standards track protocol. However, RSS has enough adoption that you can reasonably expect it to be consumable by a variety of clients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As there are quite a few 'deprecated' versions of RSS, you might conceivably have to support RSS feeds that vary quite a bit in their formatting details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RSS does not have a registered media content type. However enough publishers use the same unregistered content type that it is almost a defacto MIME type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The RFC-822 DateTime format utilized by RSS is more difficult to parse as this particular timestamp format allows a lot more possible variation in the format that is still considered valid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will need to extend the RSS format using a variety of published syndication extensions when you start trying to represent resources with complex link relations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it is important to remember that to the end-user, what syndication format you choose to use is not very important, as most feed readers and browsers handle either format equally well. The choice of syndication format however can be very important to the developer, as there are technical details that can impact the software development side of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't absolutely require perfect transactional integrity with your queries, you should be using dirty reads when accessing tables with high concurrency. I assume your Posts table would be one of those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may give you so called "phantom reads", which is when your query acts upon data from a transaction that hasn't been committed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We're not running a banking site here, we don't need perfect accuracy every time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use dirty reads. You're right in that they won't give you perfect accuracy, but they should clear up your dead locking issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Without that, we'd have to wrap every LINQ call we make (well, the simple reading ones, which is the vast majority of them) in a 3-4 line transaction code block, which is ugly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you implement dirty reads on "the base database context", you can always wrap your individual calls using a higher isolation level if you need the transactional integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we've found the pain point with ClickOnce is in &lt;em&gt;creating&lt;/em&gt; the deployments.&lt;br&gt;
We have the standard dev/test/production environments and need to be able to create deployments for each of these that install and update separate from one another.&lt;br&gt;
Also, we want control over what assemblies get deployed.&lt;br&gt;
Just because an assembly was compiled doesn't mean we want it deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obvious first choice for creating deployments is Visual Studio.&lt;br&gt;
However, VS really doesn't address the issues stated.&lt;br&gt;
The next in line is the SDK tool, Mage.&lt;br&gt;
Mage works OK but creating deployments is rather tedious and we don't want every developer having our code signing certificate and password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we ended up doing was rolling our own deployment app that uses the command line version of Mage to create the ClickOnce manifest files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't see a way to get around this. The documentation says that you cannot specify the receive of a private method. Also you can only access a private method from the same instance. The class Foo is a different object than a given instance of Foo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Not quite clear what you're trying to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I'll try to provide some information for you to decide.&lt;br /&gt;
On UNIX, &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; creates a clone of your process from the place where you called fork. Meaning, if I have the following process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;unistd.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;

int main()
{
    printf( "hi 2 u\n" );
    int mypid = fork();

    if( 0 == mypid )
        printf( "lol child\n" );
    else
        printf( "lol parent\n" );

    return( 0 );
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output will look as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;hi 2 u&lt;br /&gt;
    lol child&lt;br /&gt;
    lol parent  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; the pid returned in the child is 0, and the pid returned in the parent is the child's pid. Notice that "hi2u" is only printed once... by the &lt;strong&gt;parent&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;execve()&lt;/code&gt; and its family of functions are almost always used with &lt;code&gt;fork().&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;execve()&lt;/code&gt; and the like overwrite the current stackframe with the name of the application you pass to it. &lt;code&gt;execve()&lt;/code&gt; is almost always used with &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; where you fork a child process and if you're the parent you do whatever you need to keep doing and if you're the child you exec a new process. &lt;code&gt;execve()&lt;/code&gt; is also almost always used with &lt;code&gt;waitpid()&lt;/code&gt; -- waitpid takes a pid of a child process and, quite literally, &lt;em&gt;waits&lt;/em&gt; until the child terminates and returns the child's exit status to you.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this information, you should be able to write a very basic shell; one that takes process names on the command line and runs processes you tell it to. Of course, shells do more than that, like piping input and output, but you should be able to accomplish the basics using &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;execve()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;waitpid()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE: This is *nix specific! This will NOT work on Windows.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helped.&lt;/p&gt;

Here are some of my AOP use cases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a website in which every page is generated by a Python function.  I'd like to take a class and make all of the webpages generated by that class password-protected.  AOP comes to the rescue; before each function is called, I do the appropriate session checking and redirect if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd like to do some logging and profiling on a bunch of functions in my program during its actual usage.  AOP lets me calculate timing and print data to log files without actually modifying any of these functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a module or class full of non-thread-safe functions and I find myself using it in some multi-threaded code.  Some AOP adds locking around these function calls without having to go into the library and change anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of thing doesn't come up very often, but whenever it does, monkeypatching is VERY useful.  Python also has decorators which implement the Decorator design pattern (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern&lt;/a&gt;) to accomplish similar things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that dynamically modifying classes can also let you work around bugs or add features to a third-party library without actually having to modify that library.  I almost never need to do this, but the few times it's come up it's been incredibly useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The solution needs to handle XML
data sources that use character
encodings other than UTF-8, e.g. by
specifying the character encoding at
the XML document declaration. Not
mangling the character encoding of
the source while stripping invalid
hexadecimal characters has been a
major sticking point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The removal of invalid hexadecimal characters should only remove hexadecimal encoded values, as you can often find href values in data that happens to contains a string that would be a string match for a hexadecimal character.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to consume an XML-based data source that conforms to a specific format (think Atom or RSS feeds), but want to be able to consume data sources that have been published which contain invalid hexadecimal characters per the XML specification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In .NET if you have a Stream that represents the XML data source, and then attempt to parse it using an XmlReader and/or XPathDocument, an exception is raised due to the inclusion of invalid hexadecimal characters in the XML data. My current attempt to resolve this issue is to parse the Stream as a string and use a regular expression to remove and/or replace the invalid hexadecimal characters, but I am looking for a more performant solution.&lt;/p&gt;

The major problem with binary search trees is that you can make them unbalanced very easily. Imagine your first number is a 15. Then all the numbers after that are increasingly smaller than 15. You'll have a tree that is very heavy on the left side and has nothing on the right side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red Black trees solve that by forcing your tree to be balanced whenever you insert or delete. It accomplishes this through a series of rotations between ancestor nodes and child nodes. The algorithm is actually pretty straightforward, although it is a bit long. I'd suggest picking up the CLRS (Cormen, Lieserson, Rivest and Stein) textbook, "Introduction to Algorithms" and reading up on RB Trees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation is also not really so short so it's probably not really best to include it here. Nevertheless, trees are used &lt;em&gt;extensively&lt;/em&gt; for high performance apps that need access to lots of data. They provide a very efficient way of finding nodes, with a relatively small overhead of insertion/deletion. Again, I'd suggest looking at CLRS to read up on how they're used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While BSTs may not be used explicitly - one example of the use of trees in general are in almost every single modern RDBMS. Similarly, your file system is almost certainly represented as some sort of tree structure, and files are likewise indexed that way. Trees power Google. Trees power just about every website on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt;
@Michael, Nice code..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see how this example works, by just creating specific "views" of the original array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a few FYI questions for others who may read this later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would you see this working when passing the resultant view to other classes for use? How does the reference to the original array stay in scope?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess since you would actually be passing references to the "views", the other classes will continue to access the view in the same manner as the example in your Main. The View contains a private reference to the original array keeping in in scope and would not be GC'ed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, Keith&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW, I love this site!&lt;/p&gt;

Instead of converting the byte[] into String then pushing into XML somewhere, convert the byte[] to a String via BASE64 encoding (some XML libraries have a type to do this for you). The BASE64 decode once you get the String back from XML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;a href="http://commons.apache.org/codec/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://commons.apache.org/codec/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, I have an external disk with two volumes: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One is an HFS+ volume which I use for TimeMachine backups.
The other, an NTFS volume that I use for general file copying etc on Mac and Windows boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what happens is that whenever I plug in the disk into my Mac USB, OSX goes off and mounts both volumes and shows an icon on the desktop for each. The thing is that to remove the disk you have to eject the volume and in this case do it for both volumes, which causes an annoying warning dialog to be shown every time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I'd prefer is some way to prevent the NTFS volume from auto-mounting altogether. I've done some hefty googling and here's a list of things I've tried so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've tried going through options in Disk Utility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've tried setting AutoMount to No in /etc/hostconfig but that is a bit too global for my liking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've also tried the suggested approach to putting settings in fstab but it appears the OSX (10.5) is ignoring these settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any other suggestions would be welcomed. Just a little dissapointed that I can't just tick a box somewhere (or untick).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Thanks heaps to hop for the answer it worked a treat. For the record it turns out that it wasn't OSX not picking up the settings I actually had "msdos" instead of "ntfs" in the fs type column. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

If you only need 50 of them, and you're not low on memory then separate bools is pretty much always a better choice than a bitset. They will take more memory, but the bools will be much faster. A bitset is usually implemented as an array of ints (the bools are packed into those ints). So the first 32 bools (bits) in your bitset will only take up a single 32bit int, but to read each value you have to do some bitwise operations first to mask out all the values you don't want. E.g. to read the 2nd bit of a bitset, you need to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the int that contains the bit you want (in this case, it's the first int)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitwise And that int with '2' (i.e. value &amp;amp; 0x02) to find out if that bit is set&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if memory is a bottleneck and you have a lot of bools using a bitset could make sense (e.g. if you're target platform is a mobile phone, or it's some state in a very busy web service)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: A std::vector of bool usually has a specialisation to use the &lt;a href="http://www.informit.com/guides/content.aspx?g=cplusplus&amp;amp;seqNum=98" rel="nofollow"&gt;equivalent of a bitset&lt;/a&gt;, thus making it much smaller and also slower for the same reasons. So if speed is an issue, you'll be better off using a vector of char (or even int), or even just use an old school bool array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a big topic that many people disagree on. Some say that the algorithms taught in a CS degree such as binary search trees and directed graphs are not used in day-to-day programming and are therefore irrelevant. Others disagree, saying that these algorithms and data structures are the foundation for all of our programming and it is essential to understand them, even if you never have to write one for yourself. This filters into conversations about good interviewing and hiring practices. For example, &lt;a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/"&gt;Steve Yegge&lt;/a&gt; has an article on &lt;a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html"&gt;interviewing at Google&lt;/a&gt; that addresses this question. Remember this debate; experienced people disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In typical business programming you may not need to create binary trees or even trees very often at all. However, you will use many classes which internally operate using trees. Many of the core organization classes in every language use trees and hashes to store and access data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are involved in more high-performance endeavors or situations that are somewhat outside the norm of business programming, you will find trees to be an immediate friend. As another poster said, trees are core data structures for databases and indexes of all kinds. They are useful in data mining and visualization, advanced graphics (2d and 3d), and a host of other computational problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have used binary trees in the form of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning"&gt;BSP (binary space partitioning) trees&lt;/a&gt; in 3d graphics. I am currently looking at trees again to sort large amounts of geocoded data and other data for information visualization in Flash/Flex applications. Whenever you are pushing the boundary of the hardware or you want to run on lower hardware specifications, understanding and selecting the best algorithm can make the difference between failure and success.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When this option is set, it is possible to read uncommitted or dirty data; values in the data can be changed and rows can appear or disappear in the data set before the end of the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply put, when you are using this isolation level, and you are performing multiple queries on an active table as part of one transaction, there is no guarantee that the information returned to you within different parts of the transaction will remain the same. You could query the same data twice within one transaction and get different results (this might happen in the case where a different user was updating the same data in the midst of your transaction). This can obviously have severe ramifications for parts of your application that rely on data integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

@AlexCuse - Yes, totally agree on the performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to write it with the outer join, but then saw in his sample output the count and thought that was what he wanted, and the count would not return correctly if the tables are outer joined. Not to mention that joins can cause your records to be multiplied (1 entry from tbl1 that matches 2 entries in tbl2 = 2 returns) which can be unintended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I guess it really boils down to the specifics on what your query needs to return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE from Aug 21 '08 at 22:07:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To answer the other parts of your question - is a VB function the way to go? No. Absolutely not. Not for something this simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functions are very bad on performance, each row in the return set executes the function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to "compartmentalize" the different parts of the query you have to approach it more like a stored procedure. Build a temp table, do part of the query and insert the results into the table, then do any further queries you need and update the original temp table (or insert into more temp tables).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, bitsets are supported by C/C++ in a way that doesn't require you to do your own masking.  I don't remember the exact syntax, but it's something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;struct MyBitset {
  bool firstOption:1;
  bool secondOption:1;
  bool thirdOption:1;
  int fourBitNumber:4;
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can reference any value in that struct by just using dot notation, and the right things will happen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;MyBitset bits;
bits.firstOption = true;
bits.fourBitNumber = 2;

if(bits.thirdOption) {
  // Whatever!
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use arbitrary bit sizes for things.  The resulting struct can be up to 7 bits larger than the data you define (its size is always the minimum number of bytes needed to store the data you defined).&lt;/p&gt;

You have to find the balance where your combination of code and comments is the most readable. The worst thing you can do is add comments to obvious methods like getters and setters when they don't do more than what they should - get or set the named field. One thing that is really dangerous about comments is that they may get outdated when the implementation changes and the comments are forgotten. So you should try to focus on the interesting stuff, because that's what users of your code or yourself will see and have to trust, if they don't have the source code ;)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I usually comment "ifs" and write in "human language" what it means, like "checks if it's A or B".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself doing this, it may be better to refactor so that the complex boolean logic is extracted to another method, or at least introduce a variable with a name that makes it clear what the logic means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with comments is that they (sometimes) violate the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) guideline.  When you duplicate the logic by adding it to documentation, even comments right next to the code, you run the risk of having things fall out of date.  Soon the comments may become incomplete or inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;

Data data = collectData();
// analyze data
Report report = analyze(data);
// print report
report.print();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be aware, though, that shorter functions make it harder to see how the code, as a whole, works together.

  &lt;p&gt;Using UML is like looking at your feet as you walk. It's making conscious and explicit something that you can usually do unconsciously. Beginners need to think carefully about what they're doing, but a professional programmer already knows what they're doing. Most of the time, writing the code itself is quicker and more effective than writing about the code, because their programming intuition is tuned to the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not just about what you're doing though.  What about the new hire who comes in six months from now and needs to come up to speed on the code?  What about five years from now when everyone currently working on the project is gone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's incredibly helpful to have some basic up to date documentation available for anyone who joins the project later.  I don't advocate full blown UML diagrams with method names and parameters (WAY too difficult to maintain), but I do think that a basic diagram of the components in the system with their relationships and basic behavior is invaluable.  Unless the design of the system changes drastically, this information shouldn't change a lot even as the implementation is tweaked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've found that the key to documentation is moderation.  No one is going to read 50 pages of full blown UML diagrams with design documentation without falling asleep a few pages in.  On the other hand, most people would love to get 5-10 pages of simple class diagrams with some basic descriptions of how the system is put together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other case where I've found UML to be useful is for when a senior developer is responsible for designing a component but then hands the design to a junior developer to implement.&lt;/p&gt;

UML is a great tool for communicating ideas, the only issue is when you store and maintain it because you are essentially creating two copies of the same information and this is where it usually blows.
After the initial round of implementation most of the UML should be generated from the source code else it will go out of date very quickly or require a lot of time (with manual errors) to keep up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I would like to split the byte array at a certain point(index) without having to just create a new byte array and copy each byte at a time, increasing the in memory foot print of the operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most languages, certainly C#, once an array has been allocated, there is no way to change the size of it.  It sounds like you're looking for a way to change the length of an array, which you can't.  You also want to somehow recycle the memory for the second part of the array, to create a second array, which you also can't do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary: just create a new array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skill sets will be easier to find as far as finding C# or VB developers vs finding ActionScript guru's.  However there is the trade off:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design experience is an investment not only in Designers with artistic skill, but also in the knowledge and tools provided by Adobe.  You can nearly guarantee that a professional designer uses a mac and has experience with Adobe tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now the Silverlight designer tools are half baked and can be a headache.  For instance Blend errors when trying to render any xaml containing an IValueConverter, this is problematic.  I have no idea what the Adobe developer experience is, I'm sure it is as hairy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at this stage of the game it comes down to human resources:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have .NET experience and little invested in Design skills go Silverlight. Programming skills/tools will be transferable.
If you have Design experience and skill set go with Flex.  Designer skills/tools will be transferable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way both client platforms require communication with services to get data, so you will always leverage your existing programing expertise on the back end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paraphrased &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/5/jon-galloway" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jon's&lt;/a&gt; opinion from a different point of view:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you should look at Flex as a long-term play, just as Adobe seems to be doing. There's an obvious balance on when to use Silverlight vs. Flex when you're concerned about reach and install base, but here are more reasons Flex is a good direction to move in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second mover advantage - Just as
Adobe built a "better Java Applet"
with Flash, they're able to look at
how you'd design a runtime from
scratch, today. They have the
advantage of knowing how people use
the web today, something the
inventors of existing client
platforms could never have
accurately guessed. .NET can add
features, but they can't
realistically chuck the platform and
start over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designer familiarity - While
Flex/AIR is a new programing model,
it's not entirely unfamiliar to
designers. They'll "get" the way
Flex works a lot more quickly than
they'll understand firing up a new
design environment with new feature
poor tools and new animation
paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being rid of the RGB color model in
Silverlight- .NET was originally
built for windows and it is at the
core of how it works. Flex ditched a
long time ago for an design-centric
model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All your tools run on your mac. Nuff
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cool features - Silverlight still
has some catching up to do with
Flash on some obvious features (like
webcam / mic integration, or 3d /
graphics acceleration).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably already know this, but if you have multiple 1.1 and 2.0 sites on your machine, just remember to switch the website you're changing ASP.NET versions on to compatible app pool. ASP.NET 1.1 and 2.0 sites don't mix in the same app pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, functions should be small. Someone - I forgot who - put up some coding conventions, and one of the tips was: The function name should define everything the function does. GetUserName(), IncrementPostCount() etc. Not the how - just the "What", i.e. What the result of the function would be, but that also applies to private functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you have trouble naming your function or if you end up with "AddOrDeleteOrUpdateOrMoveOrPromoteUser()", then that's a sure sign: Your function is too long. Also, if you have uber-generic stuff like ManageDatabase() or CrashWallStreet(), that's a sure sign the function should be re-factored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 1000 Line function is most likely too long, but there are always situation where you cannot split a function, because all the code essentially belongs to one task, and that task is specified in the function name.&lt;/p&gt;

I have disabled the popup navigator window, because I only want to switch between items in the tab control. My problem is the inconsistency of what switching to the next and previous document do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every other program that uses a tab control for open document I have seen uses &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;Tab&lt;/kbd&gt; to move from left to right and &lt;kbd&gt;Shift&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;Tab&lt;/kbd&gt; to go right to left. Visual Studio breaks this with its jump to the last tab selected. You can never know what document you will end up on, and it is never the same way twice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very counterintuitive. Is this a subtle way to encourage everyone to only ever have two document open at once?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say I have a few files open. I am working in one, and I need to see what is in the next tab to the right. In every other single application on the face of the Earth, &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;Tab&lt;/kbd&gt; will get me there. But in Visual Studio, I have no idea which of the other tabs it will take me to. If I only ever have two documents open, this works great. As soon as you go to three or more, all bets are off as to what tab Visual Studio has decided to send you to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with this is that I shouldn't have to think about the tool, it should fade into the background, and I should be thinking about the task. The current tab behavior keeps pulling me out of the task and makes me have to pay attention to the tool.&lt;/p&gt;

Here are two advantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the user's information changes somehow, then you won't be storing out-of-date information in your session.  For example, if a user is granted extra privileges by an admin, then those will be immediately available without the user needing to log out and then log back in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

There's an obvious balance on when to use Silverlight vs. Flash when you're concerned about reach and install base, but here are some reasons Silverlight is a good direction to move in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second mover advantage - Just as Microsoft built a "better Java" with .NET, they're able to look at how you'd design a RIA plugin from scratch, today. They have the advantage of knowing how people use the web today, something the inventors of Flash could never have accurately guessed. Flash can add features, but they can't realistically chuck the platform and start over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developer familiarity - While Silverlight is a new model, it's not entirely unfamiliar to developers. They'll "get" the way Silverlight works a lot more quickly than they'll understand firing up a new development environment with a new scripting language and new event paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being rid of the timeline model in Flash - Flash was originally built for keyframe based animations, and while there are ways to abstract this away, it's at the core of how Flash works. Silverlight ditches that for an application-centric model. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ScottGu - ScottGu is fired up about Silverlight. Nuff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cool new features - While Silverlight still has some catching up to do with Flash on some obvious features (like webcam / mic integration, or 3d / graphics acceleration), there are some slick new technologies built in to Silverlight - Deep Zoom is one example. I'm seeing more "revolutionary" technologies on the Silverlight side, while Flash seems to be in maintenance mode at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;comment blocks of code, not necessarily every line. Explain why the following block (or stanza) of code is written the way it is. Include a date and your initials in the comment, so you know when the comment was put in and who wrote the comment. Try to avoid commentary like "this is stupid" or "I am so darn brilliant" as it really doesn't help, and may be proven wrong in the future. If you use any fancy tricks or do anything that isn't obvious from a quick glance, explain what and why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;use human-readable variable names. that means avoid single-letter variables like the plague. it's much easier to guess what a loop does if the index variable is called rowIndex than i. Almost every civilized language has a compiler or interpreter that will scrub out variable names before putting your work into machine code, so using cryptic variable names does no one any favors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;remember that compilers are smart. Very smart. Every modern compiler knows how to optimize loops and other basic things. Writing a complete while-loop on one line may look fancy to you, but it compiles the same and will trip up other people looking at your code (and even yourself if you come back to the code in a few weeks). Avoid fancy language tricks if they make the code less readable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;adopt a style and stick with it. Always do ifs, loops, etc in the same format (and same indentation). You will be able to spot various features of your code more easily because the same features will look the same. If you make a mistake, it will stand out a little more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing these things make the code more readable for everyone. Adopting good coding habits reduces dependence on comments, too, so it's a double-win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you stick to powers of 2 it keeps you within a limited set of common sizes, which itself is a good thing, and it makes it easier to guess the size of unknown objects you may encounter.  I see a fair number of other people doing this, and there is something aesthetically pleasing about it.  It generally gives me a good feeling when I see this, it means the designer was thinking like an engineer or mathemetician.

  &lt;p&gt;The only documented exception to the rule that I'm aware of is in Windows Forms, where you are officially allowed to call Control.BeginInvoke without bothering to call Control.EndInvoke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However in all other cases when dealing with the Begin/End Async pattern you should assume it will leak, as you stated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that Xcode 3 and later come with superb auto-completion and template support.  By default, you have to explicitly request completion by hitting the escape key.  (This actually works in all &lt;code&gt;NSTextView&lt;/code&gt;s; try it!)  If you want to have the completions appear automatically, you can go to &lt;strong&gt;Preferences&lt;/strong&gt; -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Code Sense&lt;/strong&gt; and set the pop-up to appear automatically after a few seconds.  You should find good completions for C and Objective-C code, and pretty good completions for C++.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xcode also has a solid template/skeleton system that you can use.  You can see what templates are available by default by going to Edit -&gt; Insert Text Macro.  Of course, you don't want to insert text macros with the mouse; that defeats the point.  Instead, you have two options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back in &lt;strong&gt;Preferences&lt;/strong&gt;,go to &lt;strong&gt;Key Bindings&lt;/strong&gt;, and then, under &lt;strong&gt;Menu Key Bindings&lt;/strong&gt;, assign a specific shortcut to macros you use often.  I personally don't bother doing this, but I know plenty of great Mac devs who do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;code&gt;CompletionPrefix&lt;/code&gt;.  By default, nearly all of the templates have a special prefix that, if you type and then hit the escape key, will result in the template being inserted.  You can use Control-/ to move between the completion fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see &lt;a href="http://crookedspin.com/2005/06/10/xcode-macros/"&gt;a full list of Xcode's default macros and their associated &lt;code&gt;CompletionPrefix&lt;/code&gt;es&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://crookedspin.com"&gt;Crooked Spin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also add your own macros, or modify the defaults.  To do so, edit the file &lt;code&gt;/Developer/Library/Xcode/Specifications/{C,HTML}.xctxtmacro&lt;/code&gt;.  The syntax should be self-explanatory, if not terribly friendly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, if you're addicted to R#, you will be disappointed by your refactoring options.  Basic refactoring is provided within Xcode through the context menu or by hitting Shift-Apple-J.  From there, you can extract and rename methods, promote and demote them through the class hierarchy, and a few other common operations.  Unfortunately, neither Xcode nor any third-party utilities offer anything approaching Resharper, so on that front, you're currently out of luck.  Thankfully, Apple has already demonstrated versions of Xcode in the works that have vastly improved refactoring capabilities, so hopefully you won't have to wait too long before the situation starts to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When concatenating three dynamic string values or less, use traditional string concatenation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

StringBuilder is more efficient generally, but if you're only concatenating a few strings and doing it all in one line, code optimizations will likely take care of it for you. It's important to think about how the code looks too: for larger sets StringBuilder will make it easier to read, for small ones StringBuilder will just add needless clutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I installed nUnit 2.5, but still with no success.  From what I've found Googling, it would seem I need to &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt; templates for the test projects in order for them to be displayed in the "Create Unit Test Project".  I would have thought that templates be readily available for nUnit, xUnit, MBUnit, et. al.   Also, it looks like I need to created registry entries.

  &lt;p&gt;When either the
  READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT or
  ALLOW SNAPSHOT ISOLATION database
  options are ON, logical copies
  (versions) are maintained for all data
  modifications performed in the
  database. Every time a row is modified
  by a specific transaction, the
  instance of the Database Engine stores
  a version of the previously committed
  image of the row in tempdb. Each
  version is marked with the transaction
  sequence number of the transaction
  that made the change. The versions of
  modified rows are chained using a link
  list. The newest row value is always
  stored in the current database and
  chained to the versioned rows stored
  in tempdb.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;For short-running transactions, a
  version of a modified row may get
  cached in the buffer pool without
  getting written into the disk files of
  the tempdb database. If the need for
  the versioned row is short-lived, it
  will simply get dropped from the
  buffer pool and may not necessarily
  incur I/O overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There appears to be a slight performance penalty for the extra overhead, but it may be negligible.  We should test to make sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try setting this option and REMOVE all NOLOCKs from code queries unless its really necessary.  NOLOCKs or using global methods in the database context handler to combat database transaction isolation levels are Band-Aids  to the problem.  NOLOCKS will mask fundamental issues with our data layer and possibly lead to selecting unreliable data, where automatic select / update row versioning appears to be the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

Yes, reading the code will tell you exactly what it's doing.  However, the code is incapable of telling you what it's &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be doing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it's safe to say that all bugs are caused when code is not doing what it's supposed to be doing :).  So if we add some key comments to provide maintainers with enough information to know what a piece of code is supposed to be doing, then we have given them the ability to fix a whole lot of bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That leaves us with the question of how many comments to put in.  If you put in too many comments, things become tedious to maintain and the comments will inevitably be out of date with the code.  If you put in too few, then they're not particularly useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've found regular comments to be most useful in the following places:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1)  A brief description at the top of a .h or .cpp file for a class explaining the purpose of the class&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2)  A comment block before the implementation of a non-trivial function explaining the purpose of it and detailing its expected inputs, potential outputs, and any oddities to expect when calling the function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, I tend to comment anything that might appear confusing or odd to someone.  For example:  "This array is 1 based instead of 0 based because of blah blah".&lt;/p&gt;

  'delim'    : /\-/,
  'parts'    : [ 'Show Name', 'Episode Name', 'Episode Number' ],
  'patterns' : [/valid name/, /valid episode name/, /valid number/ ],
  'required' : ['list', 'of', 'files'],
  'ignored'  : ['.*', 'hidden.txt'],
  'start_dir': '/path/to/dir/to/test/'
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Split the filename based on the delimiter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check each of the parts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because its an ordered list you can determine what parts are missing and if a section doesn't match any pattern it is malformed.  Here the &lt;code&gt;parts&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;patterns&lt;/code&gt; have a 1 to 1 ratio.  Two arrays instead of a dictionary enforces the order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignored and required files can be listed.  The &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;..&lt;/code&gt; files should probably be ignored automatically.  The user should be allowed to input "globs" which can be shell expanded.  I'm thinking here of &lt;code&gt;svn:ignore&lt;/code&gt; properties, but globbing is natural for listing files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here &lt;code&gt;start_dir&lt;/code&gt; would be default to the current directory but if you wanted a single file to run automated testing of a bunch of directories this would be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real loose end here is the path template and along the same lines what path is required for "valid files".  I really couldn't come up with a solid idea without writing one large regular expression and taking groups from it... to build a template.  It felt a lot like writing a TextMate language grammar.  But that starts to stray on the ease of use.  The real problem was that the path template was not composed of &lt;code&gt;parts&lt;/code&gt;, which makes sense but adds complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this strategy in tune with what you were thinking of?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This seems to take care of most problems by combining relative and absolute error tolerance. Is the ULP approach better? If so, why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ULPs are a direct measure of the "distance" between two floating point numbers.  This means that they don't require you to conjure up the relative and absolute error values, nor do you have to make sure to get those values "about right".  With ULPs, you can express directly how close you want the numbers to be, and the same threshold works just as well for small values as for large ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it's up to the compiler if it actually does inline the function. VC++ pretty much ignores your requests for inlining. It will only inline a function if it thinks it's a good idea. Recent versions of the compiler will also inline things that are in seperate .obj files and not declared inline (e.g. from code in different .cpp files) if you use &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc301698.aspx"&gt;link time code generation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Images in a photo gallery, products in a catalog, chapters in a book, etc.  Each object is represented as a row.  I want to be able to arbitrarily order these images, storing that ordering in the database so when I display the objects, they will be in the right order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, let's say I'm writing a book, and each chapter is an object.  I write my book, and put the chapters in the following order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Introduction, Accessibility, Form vs. Function, Errors, Consistency, Conclusion, Index&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes to the editor, and comes back with the following suggested order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Introduction, Form, Function, Accessibility, Consistency, Errors, Conclusion, Index&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I store this ordering in the database in a robust, efficient way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've had the following ideas, but I'm not thrilled with any of them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Array.  Each row has an ordering ID, when order is changed (via a removal followed by an insertion), the order IDs are updated.  This makes retrieval easy, since it's just &lt;code&gt;ORDER BY&lt;/code&gt;, but it seems easy to break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;// REMOVAL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;UPDATE ... SET orderingID=NULL WHERE orderingID=removedID&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;UPDATE ... SET orderingID=orderingID-1 WHERE orderingID &amp;gt; removedID&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;// INSERTION&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;UPDATE ... SET orderingID=orderingID+1 WHERE orderingID &amp;gt; insertionID&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;UPDATE ... SET orderID=insertionID WHERE ID=addedID&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linked list. Each row has a column for the id of the next row in the ordering.  Traversal seems costly here, though there may by some way to use &lt;code&gt;ORDER BY&lt;/code&gt; that I'm not thinking of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spaced array.  Set the orderingID (as used in #1) to be large, so the first object is 100, the second is 200, etc.  Then when an insertion happens, you just place it at &lt;code&gt;(objectBefore + objectAfter)/2&lt;/code&gt;.  Of course, this would need to be rebalanced occasionally, so you don't have things too close together (even with floats, you'd eventually run into rounding errors).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these seem particularly elegant to me.  Does anyone have a better way to do it?&lt;/p&gt;

It has served me just fine every time I've used it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note, you can remove the need to always do re-positioning on INSERTS/DELETES by using sparse numbering -- kind of like basic back in the day... you can number your positions 10, 20, 30, etc. and if you need to insert something in between 10 and 20 you just insert it with a position of 15.  Likewise when deleting you can just delete the row and leave the gap.  You only need to do re-numbering when you actually change the order or if you try to do an insert and there is no appropriate gap to insert into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course depending on your particular situation (e.g. whether you have the other rows already loaded into memory or not) it may or may not make sense to use the gap approach.&lt;/p&gt;

And it lets you do a lot of "database-y" things in regular C# code. It's difficult to explain just how incredibly powerful that can be. Consider how much having solid, well designed generic data structures (such as list, stack, dictionary/hash, etc.) included in common frameworks has improved the state of development in modern languages. Precisely because using these data structures is very common and reducing the intellectual overhead of using them is a huge benefit. LINQ doesn't do anything you can't do yourself, but it makes a lot of operations a lot more straightforward and a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the time-honored example of removing duplicates from a non-ordered list. In a lower level language like C or C++ you'd probably have to sort the list and maintain two indices into the list as you removed dupes. In a language with hashes (Java, C#, Javascript, Perl, etc.) you could create a hash where the keys are the unique values, then extract the keys into a new list. With LINQ you could just do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int[] data = { 0, 1, 3, 3, 7, 8, 0, 9, 2, 1 };

var uniqueData = data.GroupBy(i =&amp;gt; i).Select(g =&amp;gt; g.Key);

&lt;p&gt;But I have personally had mixed experience with MDA. The only time it was good experience was with great tools - I used to use TogetherSoft (I believe they somehow ended up at borland) - they were one of the first to introduce editing which was not "code generation" but actually editing the code/model directly (so you could edit code, or the model, it was all the one thing). They also had refactoring (which was the first time I remember it post smalltalk environments).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since that time I haven't seen MDA grow any more in popularity, at least in the mainstream, so in terms of popularity it doesn't appear to be the future  (so that kind of answers it). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course popularity isn't everything, and things to have a tendency to come back, but for the time being I think MDA+tools is viewed by many as "wizard based code generation" tools (regardless of what it really is) so I think it will be some time or perhaps never that it really takes off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A site like del.icio.us sees its tag base grow a lot, thus probably hindering usage or search. Searching for SVN-related entries will probably list a majority of entries with both subversion and svn tags, but I can think of three issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A search is incomplete as many entries may not have both tags (which are 'synonyms').&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A search is less useful as Q/A often lead to more Qs! Notably for newbies on a given topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tagging a question (note: or an answer separately, sounds useful) becomes philosophical: 'Did I Tag the Right Way?'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to address these issues is to create semantic links between tags, so that subversion and SVN are automatically bound by the system, not by poor users.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It rather depends on what you are
  doing with them. A fixed-point type
  with the same range as an IEEE float
  would be many many times slower (and
  many times larger).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, but if I want a infinitesimally small bit-resolution then it's back to my original point: == and != have no meaning in the context of such a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An int lets me express ~10^9 values (regardless of the range) which seems like enough for any situation where I would care about two of them being equal.  And if that's not enough, use a 64-bit OS and you've got about 10^19 distinct values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can express values a range of 0 to 10^200 (for example) in an int, it is just the bit-resolution that suffers (resolution would be greater than 1, but, again, no application has that sort of range as well as that sort of resolution).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, I think in all cases one either is representing a continuum of values, in which case != and == are irrelevant, or one is representing a fixed set of values, which can be mapped to an int (or a another fixed-precision type).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously the system would have to have a fairly smart matching system for that to work. Doing it this way would be extra input for the user (which'd probably annoy them) but the human input would, if done correctly, make for less duplicate tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, having said all that, the system could use the results of the user's input as a basis for automatic tag matching.

&lt;p&gt;Over the years I have seen and tried every possible way to secure an image and I have come to one conclusion: If it can be seen online; it can be taken, my friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what you really should consider what the final goal of this action would really be. Prevent piracy? If a gross and oversized watermark is not your style, you can always embed hidden data (Apress had an article that looked promising on &lt;a href="http://microsoft.apress.com/asptodayarchive/73991/steganography-hiding-data-in-images" rel="nofollow"&gt;digital steganography&lt;/a&gt;) in images to identify them as your own later. You might only offer reduced or lower quality images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flickr takes the approach of placing a transparent gif layer on top of the image so if you are not logged in and right click you get their ever awesome &lt;a href="http://l.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif" rel="nofollow"&gt;spaceball.gif&lt;/a&gt;. But nothing can prevent a screenshot other than, well, just not offering the picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the music industry could get you to listen to all of your music without copying or owning files they would. If television could broadcast and be certain nobody could store a copy of the cast, they probably would as well. It's the unfortunate part of sharing media with the public. The really good question here is how you can protect your material WITHOUT getting in the way of respectable users from consuming your images. Put on too much protection and nobody will go to your site/use your software (Personally if you try to disable my mouse I'll go from good user to bad nearly instantly). &lt;/p&gt;

Mono defines different names than Microsoft's compiler by default, and depending on what system you are you get different defines, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you provide a more specific system for which you are compiling, we might be able to come up with the list for that particular system (for example: x64 Vista system, using Visual Studio 2008).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By "bytes" up there I mean the "smallest unit of memory the architecture can manage individually". So, if the smallest unit is 16 bits long (what in x86 would be called a &lt;em&gt;word&lt;/em&gt;) then a 32 bit "word" representing the value 0xFFFF0000 could be stored like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;FFFF 0000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;0000 FFFF
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in memory, depending on endianness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you have 8-bit endianness, it means that every word consisting of 16 bits, will be stored as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;FF 00
