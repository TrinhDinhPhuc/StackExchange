I would highly recommend it especially if the other remembers have used something similar. It takes a while for normal programmers to get used to it, but the result's are much better if you already know how to program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C/C++ equals manage your own memory. You'll be swimming in memory links and worrying about them. Go with LabVIEW and make sure you read the documentation that comes with LabVIEW and watch out for race conditions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning a language is easy. Learning how to program is not. This doesn't change even if it's a graphical language. The advantage of Graphical languages is that it is easier to visual what the code will do rather than sit there and decipher a bunch of text. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important thing is not the language but the programming concepts. It shouldn't matter what language you learn to program in, because with a little effort you should be able to program well in any language. Languages come and go.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It's just not possible. There is always the PrintScreen button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember testing &lt;a href="http://www.imagefreeze.com/IF_ENG/index.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;ImageFreeze&lt;/a&gt; years ago. It used a Java applet to fetch and display images. The image data and connection was encrypted and the unencrypted image wasn't stored in a temp folder or even in Java's cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the applet constantly cleared the windows clipbrd so Print Screen didn't work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It worked pretty good, but it had some faults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides requiring Java, the JS that embedded the applet (and maybe the applet itself) was setup to not load properly in any browser that didn't give access to the windows clipbrd. This meant that it only worked in IE and only on windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the interval the applet used to clear the clipbrd could be beaten with a really fast Print Screen and ctrl+v into Gimp. Printing the screen in other ways would work too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="http://www.kpdus.com/jad.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jad&lt;/a&gt; could decompile the applet and all/most of its files. So, if you really wanted the pics, you could poke around in the source to figure out how they did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, you can go out of your way to stop a lot of people, but usability goes down the drain and there will always be a way to get the image if the visitor can see it.&lt;/p&gt;

I ran into some trouble when I tried to test against the database.  To my understanding, unit tests should be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stateless&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;independent from each other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;repeatable with the same results i.e. no persisting changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These requirements seem to be at odds with each other when developing for a database.  For example, I can't test Insert() without making sure the rows to be inserted aren't there yet, thus I need to call the Delete() first.  But, what if they aren't already there?  Then I would need to call the Exists() function first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My eventual solution involved very large setup functions (yuck!) and an empty test case which would run first and indicate that the setup ran without problems.  This is sacrificing on the independence of the tests while maintaining their statelessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another solution I found is to wrap the function calls in a transaction which can be easily rolled back, like &lt;a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2004/10/05/238201.aspx"&gt;Roy Osherove's XtUnit&lt;/a&gt;.  This work, but it involves another library, another dependency, and it seems a little too heavy of a solution for the problem at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what has the SO community done when confronted with this situation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tgmdbm said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You typically use your favourite
  automated unit testing framework to
  perform integration tests, which is
  why some people get confused, but they
  don't follow the same rules. You are
  allowed to involve the concrete
  implementation of many of your classes
  (because they've been unit tested).
  You are testing &lt;strong&gt;how your concrete
  classes interact with each other and
  with the database&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if I read this correctly, there is really no way to &lt;em&gt;effectively&lt;/em&gt; unit-test a Data Access Layer.  Or, would a "unit test" of a Data Access Layer involve testing, say, the SQL/commands generated by the classes, independent of actual interaction with the database?&lt;/p&gt;

It is much more straight forward than trying to figure out the crazy LDAP syntax, which is necessary for some of the other solutions recommended here. As long as you impersonate the user you want to run the check as by calling "LoginUser", you should not run into any security issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find sample code for doing the impersonation &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.principal.windowsimpersonationcontext.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need help figuring out how to call "NetLocalGroupGetMembers" from C#, I reccomend that you checkout Jared Parson's PInvoke assistant, which you can &lt;a href="http://www.codeplex.com/clrinterop" rel="nofollow"&gt;download&lt;/a&gt; from codeplex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are running the code in an ASP.NET app running in IIS, and want to impersonate the user accessing the website in order to make the call, then you may need to grant "Trusted for Delegation" permission to the production web server. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are running on the desktop, then using the active user's security credentials should not be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that you network admin could have revoked access to the "Securable Object" for the particular machine you are trying to access. Unfortunately that access is necessary for all of the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa370675.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;network management api&lt;/a&gt; functions to work. If that is the case, then you will need to grant access to the "Securable Object" for whatever users you want to execute as. With the default windows security settings all authenticated users should have access, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;

You are testing how your concrete classes interact with each other and with the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use this tool to export the state of a database at a given time, and then when you're unit testing, it can be rolled back to its previous state automatically at the beginning of the tests.  We use it quite often where I work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the following scenario:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class A { public: void Foo() {} };
class B : public A {};
class C : public A {};
class D : public B, public C {};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above class hierarchy results in the "dreaded diamond" which looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  A
 / \
B   C
 \ /
  D
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An instance of D will be made up of B, which includes A, and C which also includes A. So you have two "instances" (for want of a better expression) of A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have this scenario, you have the possibility of ambiguity. What happens when you do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;D d;
d.Foo(); // is this B's Foo() or C's Foo() ??
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual inheritance is there to solve this problem. When you specify virtual when inheriting your classes, you're telling the compiler that you only want a single instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class A { public: void Foo() {} };
class B : public virtual A {};
class C : public virtual A {};
class D : public B, public C {};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that there is only one "instance" of A included in the hierarchy. Hence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;D d;
d.Foo(); // no longer ambiguous
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

This is not always straightforward, and sometimes requires some ingenuity, but there are several good (freeware) mock libraries out there for .Net if you don't want to "roll your own".  Two come to mind immediately:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ayende.com/"&gt;Rhino Mocks&lt;/a&gt; is one that has a pretty good reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nmock.org/"&gt;NMock&lt;/a&gt; is another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of commercial mock libraries available, too.  Part of writing good unit tests is actually desinging your code for them - for example, by using interfaces where it makes sense, so that you can "mock" a dependent object by implmenting a "fake" version of its interface that nonetheless behaves in a predictable way, for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In database mocks, this means "mocking" your own DB access layer with objects that return made up table, row, or dataset objects for your unit tests to deal with.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where I work, we typically make our own mock libs from scratch, but that doesn't mean you have to. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A virtual base class is a class that
  cannot be instantiated : you cannot
  create direct object out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you are confusing two very different things.  Virtual inheritance is not the same thing as an abstract class.  Virtual inheritance modifies the behaviour of function calls;  sometimes it resolves function calls that otherwise would be ambiguous, sometimes it defers function call handling to a class other than that one would expect in a non-virtual inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't have a virtual base class in your OP. You just have a base class. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You did virtual inheritance. This is usually used in multiple inheritance so that multiple derived classes use the members of the base class without reproducing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A base class with a pure virtual function is not be instantiated. this requires the syntax that Paul gets at. It is typically used so that derived classes must define those functions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't want to explain any more about this because I don't totally get what you're asking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual inheritance doesn't come without a price.  Like with all things virtual, you get a performance hit.  There is a way around this performance hit, that is questionably less elegant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of breaking the diamond by deriving virtually, you can add another layer to the diamond, to get something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;   B
  / \
D11 D12
 |   |
D21 D22
 \   /
  DD
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non of the class inherit virtuall, all inherit publicaly.  Classes D21 and D22 will then hide virtual function f() which is ambiguous for DD, perhaps by declaring the function private.  They'd each define a wrapper function, f1() and f2() respectively, each calling class-local (private) f(), thus resolving conflicts.  Class DD calls f1() if it wants D11::f() and f2() if it wants D12::f().  If you define the wrappers inline you'll probably get about zero overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you can change D11 and D12 then you can do the same trick inside these classes, but often that is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;

You need to get the parent of the parent... of the leaf and updates it's total (either subtracting the old and adding the new, or recomputing). You need some form of identifier to see the structure of the tree, and grab all of a nodes children and a list of the parents/path to a leaf to update. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method adds constant space (2 columns to your table --but you only need one table, else you can do a join later). I played around with a structure awhile ago that used a hierarchical format using 'left' and 'right' columns (obviously not those names), calculated by a pre-order traversal and a post-order traversal, respectively --don't worry these don't need to be recalculated every time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;emailUtil.sendEmail(userId, "foo");

public void sendEmail(String userId, String message) throws MailException {
    /* ... logic that could throw a MailException */
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;MailException&lt;/code&gt; could be thrown for a number of reasons, problems with the email address, problems with the mail template etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is this: do you create a new Exception type for every one of these exceptions and then deal with them individually or do you create one MailException and then store something in the exception (something computer-readable, not the description text) that allows us to do different things based on what actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; As a clarification, the exceptions aren't for logs and what-not, this relates to how code reacts to them. To keep going with the mail example, let's say that when we send mail it could fail because you don't have an email address, or it could because you don't have a &lt;strong&gt;valid&lt;/strong&gt; email address, or it could fail.. etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My code would want to react differently to each of these issues (mostly by changing the message returned to the client, but actual logic as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would it be best to have an exception implementation for each one of these issues or one umbrella exception that had something internal to it (an enum say) that let the code distinguish what kind of issue it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Grab 30&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grab EOF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at the second-to-last iteration.  You grabbed 30, then carried on to check for EOF.  You haven't reached EOF because the EOF mark hasn't been read yet ("binarically" speaking, its conceptual location is just after the 30 line).  Therefore you carry on to the next iteration.  x is still 30 from previous iteration.  Now you read from the stream and you get EOF.  x remains 30 and the ios::eofbit is raised.  You output to stderr x (which is 30, just like in the previous iteration).  Next you check for EOF in the loop condition, and this time you're out of the loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;while (true) {

It's an unexpected exception, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I do want to catch a specific exception (as you seem to want to do). You'll probably find, however, that this is somewhat rare and that it is indicative of using exceptions to control logic -- which is inefficient (slow) and often frowned upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So using your example, if you want to run some special logic when the email server is not configured, you may want to add a method to the emailUtil object like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;public bool isEmailConfigured()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... call that first, instead of looking for a specific exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When an exception does happen, it really means that the situation was completely unexpected and the code can't handle it -- so the best you can do is report it to the user (or write it to a log or restart )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for having an exception hierarchy vs exceptions-with-error-codes-in-them, I typically do the latter. It's easier to add new exceptions, if you just need to define a new error constant instead of a whole new class. But, it doesn't matter much as long as you try to be consistent throughout your project.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm implementing an MVP architecture because I'm sick of Winforms and wanted something that had a better separation of concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with MVP, the Presenter handles events raised by the View. Here's some code that I have in place to deal with the creation of users:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class CreateMemberPresenter
{
    private ICreateMemberView view;

    {

    }

    private void HookupEventHandlersTo(ICreateMemberView view)
    {
        view.CreateMember += delegate { CreateMember(); };
    }

    private void CreateMember()
    {
        if (!view.IsValid)
            return;

        try
        {
            int newUserId;
            tasks.CreateMember(view.NewMember, out newUserId);
            view.NewUserCode = newUserId;
            view.Notify(new NotificationDTO() { Type = NotificationType.Success });
        }
        catch(Exception e)
        {
            this.LogA().Message(string.Format("Error Creating User: {0}", e.Message));
            view.Notify(new NotificationDTO() { Type = NotificationType.Failure, Message = "There was an error creating a new member" });
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have my main form validation done using the built in .Net Validation Controls, but now I need to verify that the data sufficiently satisfies the criteria for the Service Layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say the following Service Layer messages can show up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E-mail account already exists (failure)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refering user entered does not exist (failure)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Password length exceeds datastore allowed length (failure)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member created successfully (success)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's also say that more rules will be in the service layer that the UI cannot anticipate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I'm having the service layer throw an exception if things didn't go as planned. Is that a sufficent strategy? Does this code smell to you guys? If I wrote a service layer like this would you be annoyed at having to write Presenters that use it in this way? Return codes seem too old school and a bool is just not informative enough.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit not by OP: merging in follow-up comments that were posted as answers by the OP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheekysoft, I like the concept of a ServiceLayerException. I already have a global exception module for the exceptions that I don't anticipate. Do you find making all these custom exceptions tedious? I was thinking that catching base Exception class was a bit smelly but wasn't exactly sure how progress from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tgmdbm, I like the clever use of the lambda expression there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks Cheekysoft for the follow-up. So I'm guessing that would be the strategy if you don't mind the user being displayed a separate page (I'm primarily a web developer) if the Exception is not handled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if I want to return the error message in the same view where the user submitted the data that caused the error, I would then have to catch the Exception in the Presenter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's what the CreateUserView looks like when the Presenter has handled the ServiceLayerException:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HOJU7.png" alt="Create a user"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this kind of error, it's nice to report it to the same view. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I think we're going beyond the scope of my original question now. I'll play around with what you've posted and if I need further details I'll post a new question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saving user settings in Program Files causes problems if more than two people use the computer at once (eg. Terminal Services) who's settings should be saved, do you want other users to know 'your' settings? What happens if your program writes settings to the file as user A, but user B can't edit the file? User B may have access to the directory, but not read/delete the preference file as this is owned by user A. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legacy win9x programs often write to the program files folder, Windows Vista actually does some neat trickery to let these programs work. When your program writes a file, vista actually puts it someplace else that is only accessible to that user. The same is done for registry writes to HKLM (or so I discovered after hours of debugging...) and Server 2008 does the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're needing to save user settings the best alternative would be to save the settings to the Application Data folder (Environment Variable %APPDATA%)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the settings are system wide, then the administrative user should set these after install or on first run and they should not be able to be overwritten by limited users.&lt;/p&gt;

They can be opened in separate windows, or docked into tabs in the main window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I open a modal dialog from one of the separate forms, the main form is brought to the front, and is shown as the selected window in the windows taskbar. Say the main form is the WYSIWYG view, and the source view is poped out. You go to a particular point in the source view and insert an image tag. A dialog appears to allow you to select and enter the properties you want for the image. If the WYSIWYG view and the source view overlap, the WYSIWYG view will be brought to the front and the source view is hidden. Once the dialog is dismissed, the source view comes back into sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've tried setting the owner and the ParentWindow properties to the form it is related to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;code&gt;dialog := TDialogForm.Create( parentForm );&lt;br&gt;
  dialog.ParentWindow := parentForm.Handle;

&lt;p&gt;How can I fix this problem? What else should I be trying?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that people seem to be stumbling on my example, perhaps I can try with a better example: a text editor that allows you to have more than one file open at the same time. The files you have open are either in tabs (like in the Delphi IDE) or in its own window. Suppose the user brings up the spell check dialog or the find dialog. What happens, is that if the file is being editing in its own window, that window is sent to below the main form in the z-order when the modal dialog is shown; once the dialog is closed, it is returned to its original z-order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kingdom of Nouns&lt;/a&gt; syndrome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing the simple easy thing is cluttered up with implementation details of what you'd need when you're doing the complex, carefully optimized thing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To elaborate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kingdom of Nouns syndrome is another way of saying that Java doesn't want you to create functions as objects.  It's possible, but it goes violently against the design principles of just about every library and framework you'll see.  Time and time again I find myself settling on code duplication or inelegant hacks because Java doesn't like functions as objects.  If Java gets &lt;a href="http://www.javac.info/" rel="nofollow"&gt;closures&lt;/a&gt; I will be a happy person indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the second, I'll simply pose a question: Can you write a Java program to read in a file line by line and do something with each line?   Off the top of your head?  Without referring to documentation or other code?  Without your IDE?  And have it compile and run on your first try?  If you can, you're a far better BufferedInputPerson than I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn't so much a problem with the language as it is the standard library.  Well, ignoring the exception debate.  You did remember to handle exceptions, didn't you?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, in theory, it could be as simple as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for(String line : new FileLineReader(filename))
    doSomething(line);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...but that isn't really in the Java style.  I mean, I love the power of the Java library, but it  seems like not much effort is made to make the easy things easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Two technical problems that is.  There are still some people around with a sour taste in their mouths from back when java was slow, garbage collection paused execution, and tool support hadn't made Java habitable yet&lt;/p&gt;

The status objects contain a severity enum (information, warning, error, ...) a status object name like "Email Address" and a user readable message like "Badly formatted Email Address"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The calling code would then decide which to filter up to the UI and which to handle itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think exceptions are strictly for when you can't implement a normal code solution.  The performance hit and handling restrictions are just a bit too much for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason for using a list of status objects is that identifying multiple errors (such as during validation) is MUCH easier.  After all, you can only throw one exception which must be handled before moving on.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a user submitting an email that had a malformed destination address and contained language that you are blocking.  Do you throw the malformed email exception, then, after they fix that and resubmit, throw a bad language exception?  From a user experience perspective dealing with all of them at once is a better way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; combining answers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Jonathan: My point was that I can evaluate the action, in this case sending an email, and send back multiple failure reasons. For example, "bad email address", "blank message title", etc..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an exception, you're limited to just percolating the one problem then asking the user to resubmit at which point they find out about a second problem. This is really bad UI design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reinventing the wheel.. possibly. However, most applications should analyze the whole transaction in order to give the best possible information to the user. Imagine if your compiler stopped dead at the first error. You then fix the error and hit compile again only to have it stop again for a different error. What a pain in the butt. To me, that's exactly the problem with throwing exceptions and hence the reason I said to use a different mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

This is mainly because if I don't have a specific need for encapsulation then doing it is just a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, with the aggregate initializes feature in C# 3.0, there are some new situations where I would advocate using customized collection classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, C# 3.0 allows any class that implements &lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&lt;/code&gt; and has an Add method to use the new aggregate initializer syntax. For example, because Dictionary defines a method Add(K key, V value) it is possible to initialize a dictionary using this syntax:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var d = new Dictionary&amp;lt;string, int&amp;gt;
{
    {"hello", 0},
    {"the answer to life the universe and everything is:", 42}
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great thing about the feature is that it works for add methods with any number of arguments. For example, given this collection:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class c1 : IEnumerable
{
    void Add(int x1, int x2, int x3)
    {
        //...
    }

    //...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it would be possible to initialize it like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var x = new c1
{
    {1,2,3},
    {4,5,6}
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be really useful if you need to create static tables of complex objects. For example, if you were just using &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Customer&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and you wanted to create a static list of customer objects you would have to create it like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var x = new List&amp;lt;Customer&amp;gt;
{
    new Customer("Scott Wisniewski", "555-555-5555", "Seattle", "WA"),
    new Customer("John Doe", "555-555-1234", "Los Angeles", "CA"),
    new Customer("Michael Scott", "555-555-8769", "Scranton PA"),
    new Customer("Ali G", "", "Staines", "UK")
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you use a customized collection, like this one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class CustomerList  : List&amp;lt;Customer&amp;gt;
{
    public void Add(string name, string phoneNumber, string city, string stateOrCountry)
    {
        Add(new Customer(name, phoneNumber, city, stateOrCounter));
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could then initialize the collection using this syntax:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var customers = new CustomerList
{
    {"Scott Wisniewski", "555-555-5555", "Seattle", "WA"},
    {"John Doe", "555-555-1234", "Los Angeles", "CA"},
    {"Michael Scott", "555-555-8769", "Scranton PA"},
    {"Ali G", "", "Staines", "UK"}
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has the advantage of being both easier to type and easier to read because their is no need to retype the element type name for each element. The advantage can be particularly strong if the element type is long or complex. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, this is only useful if you need static collections of data defined in your app. Some types of apps, like compilers, use them all the time. Others, like typical database apps don't because they load all their data from a database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My advice would be that if you either need to define a static collection of objects, or need to encapsulate away the collection interface,  then create a custom collection class. Otherwise I would just use &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets pretend we have an interface called IPayable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public interface IPayable
{
    public Pay(double amount);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we have two concrete classes that implement this interface:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class BusinessAccount : IPayable
{
    public void Pay(double amount)
    {
     //Logic
    }
}

public class CustomerAccount : IPayable
{
    public void Pay(double amount)
    {
     //Logic
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, lets pretend we have a collection of various accounts, to do this we will use a generic list of the type IPayable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;IPayable&amp;gt; accountsToPay = new List&amp;lt;IPayable&amp;gt;();
accountsToPay.add(new CustomerAccount());
accountsToPay.add(new BusinessAccount());
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we want to pay $50.00 to all those accounts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;foreach (IPayable account in accountsToPay)
{
    account.Pay(50.00);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now you see how interfaces are incredibly useful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are used on instantiated objects only. Not on static classes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you had made pay static, when looping through the IPayable's in accountsToPay there would be no way to figure out if it should call pay on BusinessAcount or CustomerAccount.&lt;/p&gt;

I am currently adding functionality to a PHP application I wrote for a client 2 years ago.  In the interest of full disclosure, this was the first "real" application I ever built from the ground up, in the sense that I actually met with clients to determine and write a spec.  I then built the application by myself, learning SQL as I went (I had some prior rudimentary PHP experience).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The client contacted me this week to make modifications to existing functionality as well as add new modules to the application.  I realize now that I did a poor job of modularizing the application from the start to make additions easier.  Currently, the code base is almost 20,000 lines of code (it is a fairly sophisticated, if narrow application).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm struggling with whether or not to "rewrite" the application to make future changes easier and more efficient.  I should point out that the nature of my agreement with the client is one in which I will be the only person making modifications in the future.  They will not seek another developer for this app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The budding programmer in me always wants to do things in the cleanest and most efficient way in order to satisfy my own OCD, but I do intend to bill the client for any time I spend rewriting.  Morally, I feel fine with this because the initial rate that I charged them was low - they got a stable, working app which has been performing without any intervention from me for 2 years, and I got my first real development project on my resume.  My dilemma is about when to decide to rewrite an application for the sake of future development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please weigh in with your thoughts.  I'm sure I'm not the only one who has ever had this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say it doesn't seem like you need to rewrite your application as you say it is stable and works fine. But ultimately the decision is on how often do you think you will be required or needed to make changes or additions to the application. If you are going to be adding to the app once every couple of years, doesn't seem to be worth the time depending on how long a rewrite will take again versus the time involved to write changes into the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is, when you get done with rewriting, I've found things can just as easily end up not quite as smooth as you imagine they will become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be better to smooth out the areas needed to add the new modules, which will improve the system for further additions, but not waste the time to rewrite the entire app.  This saves money for who you are working for, and saves you from ending up back where you started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am of this opinion because I took the route once to rewrite a particular control for an app (not the same as a whole application, but still)... the existing implementation had many things I felt I could improve upon, including better encapsulation, more DRY, and better performance.  I ended up achieving the goal, but there was still performance problems and though I improved some of the modularization, it still ended up a lot more messy than I had envisioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel I learned the hard way that re-implementing is something you should take seriously, and only use this when there is design flaws that really warrant such an action (and to be honest, I don't know what kind of design flaws can require this, short of finding GOTO all over your codebase).  Deciding to re-implement is an easy quick decision if you haven't delved deep into the code to really understand what it was you (or whoever wrote it) had been thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially think what gains who you wrote it for will get out of a rewrite... and make sure they are fully aware of what is going on, and agree to it.&lt;/p&gt;

On the other hand in your position I would rather not rewrite my whole program since I have experience with these things. What would you really do differently?

When you rewrite you tend to focus on what you didn't like in the previous version and overlook other details in the new version. So even though the result is usually better, it is also usually not perfect, and more often than not it is not really worth the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, it's always tempting to think in terms of "making future improvements easier", but in that kind of professional relationship, you never really know what the future looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I typically do is a create a very lightweight HTTPHandler to serve the images:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;using System;
using System.Web;

namespace Example
{  
    public class GetImage : IHttpHandler
    {

        public void ProcessRequest(HttpContext context)
        {
            if (context.Request.QueryString("id") != null)
            {
                Blob = GetBlobFromDataBase(id);
                context.Response.Clear();
                context.Response.ContentType = "image/pjpeg";
                context.Response.BinaryWrite(Blob);
                context.Response.End();
            }

                return false;
            }
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can reference this directly in your img tag:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img src="GetImage.ashx?id=111"/&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, you could even create a server control that does it for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;using System;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;

namespace Example.WebControl
{

    [ToolboxData("&amp;lt;{0}:DatabaseImage runat=server&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/{0}:DatabaseImage&amp;gt;")]
    public class DatabaseImage : Control
    {

        public int DatabaseId
        {
            get
            {
                if (ViewState["DatabaseId" + this.ID] == null)
                    return 0;
                else
                    return ViewState["DataBaseId"];
            }
            set
            {
                ViewState["DatabaseId" + this.ID] = value;
            }
        }

        protected override void RenderContents(HtmlTextWriter output)
        {
            output.Write("&amp;lt;img src='getImage.ashx?id=" + this.DatabaseId + "'/&amp;gt;");
            base.RenderContents(output);
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be used like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;cc:DatabaseImage id="db1" DatabaseId="123" runat="server/&amp;gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first question depends on your timeframe. Flash Player has over 95% reach, Silverlight has no way near that. However, Silverlight may get there, it is after all backed by Microsoft. If you aim to launch a site next week and want a huge audience, Silverlight is not an option. If you aim to launch a really cool application that everyone would want to use it's a bit different, if your app is good enough your target audience may install Silverlight just to be able to run it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the second question its a matter of how easy it is to develop &lt;em&gt;applications&lt;/em&gt; in Silverlight. Flex isn't just a set of widgets, it's a very big framework that does a lot of thing that ease the work of the developer. You could write the same applications using only the core Flash API, but it would be very much more work. Depending on what's available in Silverlight, this should be an important factor when deciding. If you can cut development time, is having two platforms worth it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you've shown so far is solved by simple locking, which Sql Server is happy to do all day long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect you (or LINQ) are starting a transaction with that UPDATE statement in it, and SELECTing some other piece of info before hand. But, you really need to backtrack through the deadlock graph to find the locks &lt;em&gt;held&lt;/em&gt; by each thread, and then backtrack through Profiler to find the statements that caused those locks to be granted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect that there's at least 4 statements to complete this puzzle (or a statement that takes multiple locks - perhaps there's a trigger on the Posts table?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, if you don't know what exception has occurred how can you hope to recover from it. If you expect that a user might type a filename in wrong then you can expect a FileNotFoundException and tell the user to try again. If that same code generated a NullReferenceException and you simply told the user to try again they wouldn't know what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the FxCop guidelines do focus on Library/Framework code - not all their rules are designed to be applicable to EXE's or ASP.Net web sites. So having a global exception handler that will log all exceptions and exit the application nicely is a good thing to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main thing it depends on is where your are catching the exception.  In general libraries should be more conservative with catching exceptions whereas at the top level of your program (e.g. in your main method or in the top of the action method in a controller, etc) you can be more liberal with what you catch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is that e.g. you don't want to catch all exceptions in a library because you may mask problems that have nothing to do with your library, like "OutOfMemoryException" which you really would prefer bubbles up so that the user can be notified, etc.  On the other hand, if you are talking about catching exceptions inside your main() method which catches the exception, displays it and then exits... well, it's probably safe to catch just about any exception here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important rule about catching all exceptions is that you should never just swallow all exceptions silently... e.g. something like this in Java:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;try { 
    something(); 
} catch (Exception ex) {}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or this in Python:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;try:
    something()
except:
    pass
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because these can be some of the hardest issues to track down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good rule of thumb is that you should only catch exceptions that you can properly deal with yourself.  If you cannot handle the exception completely then you should let it bubble up to someone who can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By catching an exception and allowing the code execution to continue, you are stating that you know how do deal with and circumvent, or fix a particular problem. You are stating that this is &lt;strong&gt;a recoverable situation&lt;/strong&gt;. Catching Exception or SystemException means that you will catch problems like IO errors, network errors, out-of-memory errors, missing-code errors, null-pointer-dereferencing and the likes. It is a lie to say that you can deal with these. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a well organised application, these unrecoverable problems should be handled high up the stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just doing some more research, looks like I am on to a winner, just need to get the code sorted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I have the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;XmlSeralizer&lt;/em&gt; is basically a class that does some nifty reflection on the classes it is serializing. It determines the properties that are serialized based on the &lt;strong&gt;Type&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reason the problem occurs is because a type mismatch is occurring, it is expecting the &lt;em&gt;BaseType&lt;/em&gt; but in fact receives the &lt;em&gt;DerivedType&lt;/em&gt; .. While you may think that it would treat it polymorphically, it doesn't since it would involve a whole extra load of reflection and type-checking, which it is not designed to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This behaviour appears to be able to be overridden (code pending) by creating a proxy class to act as the go-between for the serializer. This will basically determine the type of the derived class and then serialize that as normal. This proxy class then will feed that XML back up the line to the main serializer..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch this space! ^_^&lt;/p&gt;

One of the most mentioned is circular references: Suppose A references B, B references C and C references B. If A were to drop its reference to B, both B and C will still have a reference count of 1 and won't be deleted with traditional reference counting. CPython (reference counting is not part of python itself, but part of the C implementation thereof) catches circular references with a separate garbage collection routine that it runs periodically...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another drawback: Reference counting can make execution slower. Each time an object is referenced and dereferenced, the interpreter/VM must check to see if the count has gone down to 0 (and then deallocate if it did). Garbage Collection does not need to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Garbage Collection can be done in a separate thread (though it can be a bit tricky). On machines with lots of RAM and for processes that use memory only slowly, you might not want to be doing GC at all!

  <row Id="21967" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="21560" CreationDate="2008-08-22T09:13:56.527" Score="3" Body="&lt;p&gt;I finally got Multisampling working with my wxWidgets OpenGL program. It's a bit messy right now, but here's how:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wxWidgets&lt;/strong&gt; doesn't have &lt;strong&gt;Multisampling&lt;/strong&gt; support in their &lt;strong&gt;stable releases&lt;/strong&gt; right now (latest version at this time is &lt;strong&gt;2.8.8&lt;/strong&gt;). But, it's available as a patch and also through their daily snapshot. (The latter is heartening, since it means that the patch has been accepted and should appear in later stable releases if there are no issues.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, there are 2 options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Download and build from their &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://biolpc22.york.ac.uk/pub/Daily_HEAD/" rel="nofollow"&gt;daily snapshot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;amp;atid=309863&amp;amp;aid=1915804&amp;amp;group_id=9863" rel="nofollow"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for your working wxWidgets installation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the 2nd option to be less cumbersome, since I don't want to disturb my working installation as much as possible. If you don't know how to patch on Windows, see &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19611/" rel="nofollow"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very least, for Windows, the patch will modify the following files:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$(WX_WIDGETS_ROOT)/include/wx/glcanvas.h
$(WX_WIDGETS_ROOT)/include/wx/msw/glcanvas.h
$(WX_WIDGETS_ROOT)/src/msw/glcanvas.cpp
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After patching, &lt;strong&gt;recompile&lt;/strong&gt; the wxWidgets libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enable multisampling in your wxWidgets OpenGL program, minor changes to the code are required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An attribute list needs to be passed to the &lt;strong&gt;wxGLCanvas&lt;/strong&gt; constructor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int attribList[] = {WX_GL_RGBA,
                    WX_GL_DOUBLEBUFFER,
                    WX_GL_SAMPLE_BUFFERS, GL_TRUE, // Multi-sampling
                    WX_GL_DEPTH_SIZE, 16,
                    0, 0};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were already using an attribute list, then add the line with &lt;code&gt;GL_SAMPLE_BUFFERS, GL_TRUE&lt;/code&gt; to it. Else, add this attribute list definition to your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then modify your wxGLCanvas constructor to take this attribute list as a parameter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;myGLFrame::myGLFrame    // Derived from wxGLCanvas
(
    wxWindow *parent,
    wxWindowID id,
    const wxPoint&amp;amp; pos,
    const wxSize&amp;amp; size,
    long style,
    const wxString&amp;amp; name
)
: wxGLCanvas(parent, (wxGLCanvas*) NULL, id, pos, size, style, name, attribList)
{
    // ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the wxGLCanvas element is created, multisampling is turned on by default. To disable or enable it at will, use the related OpenGL calls:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;glEnable(GL_MULTISAMPLE);
glDisable(GL_MULTISAMPLE);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multisampling should now work with the wxWidgets OpenGL program. Hopefully, it should be supported in the stable release of wxWidgets soon, making this information irrelevant :-)&lt;/p&gt;

This is the genius of refactoring, you don't have to make a monolithic decision to blow the whole works to smithereens and start from scratch, you can approach things piecemeal and work towards a better design as an ongoing goal. Don't rebuild the house from the ground up, instead paint the living room, then remodel the kitchen, then rewire the den, then redo the window, then landscape the yard, then fix the roof, etc. Eventually you end up in a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus#George_Washington.27s_axe"&gt;Grandfather's Axe&lt;/a&gt; situation, allowing you to change more over time than you probably ever feasibly could in one huge chunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do this at many different levels, making little improvements with most every checkin (using extract method, rename variable/method, etc.) to make chunks of code more readable and more maintainable. Or making big improvements using dedicated budgets, still working incrementally from point A to point B but having the firm goal of reaching point B (the improved design). You can still make breaking changes but you need to be smart about making them. Rather than just replacing some bit of functionality with some completely new way (i.e. API) of doing things you can keep the old bits in place and add new stuff in addition to it, then you can flag the old bits as obsolete and then later delete them, after people have been given enough time to make a graceful transition to the new way of doing things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;local time... fancy that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time tuple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;The other representation is a tuple of 9 integers giving local time.
The tuple items are:
  year (four digits, e.g. 1998)
  month (1-12)
  day (1-31)
  hours (0-23)
  minutes (0-59)
  seconds (0-59)
  weekday (0-6, Monday is 0)
  Julian day (day in the year, 1-366)
  DST (Daylight Savings Time) flag (-1, 0 or 1)
If the DST flag is 0, the time is given in the regular time zone;
if it is 1, the time is given in the DST time zone;
if it is -1, mktime() should guess based on the date and time.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Epoch is in UTC.&lt;/p&gt;

5

That's probably the strongest recommendation towards using it here. Plus the EntLib cache doesn't have dependencies, which for me is a big reason not to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think there's a technical limitation as such on shipping System.Web as part of your app, though it's slightly odd that they've put that notice in on the .NET 3.5 page. Hanselman actually says he started out being creeped out by this notion, but became convinced. Also if you read the comments, he says that the block has too many moving parts and the ASP.NET Cache is much more lightweght.&lt;br /&gt;
I think this is exactly the kind of problem that &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/velocity/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Velocity&lt;/a&gt; is going to solve, but that's only a preview for now :-(  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd say use Web.Caching and see how you get on. If you put some kind of abstraction layer over the top of it, you've always got the option to swap it out for the EntLib block later on if you find problems.&lt;/p&gt;

Options I see are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plain HTML. Let the request format the data and return it in a usable format. 
Advantage: easy to consume by the calling page. Disadvantage: Very rigid, stuck with a fixed layout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;XML. Let the request return XML, format it using XSLT on the calling page. Advantage: the requested service is easily consumed by other sources. Disadvantage: Is browser support for XSLT good enough?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;JSON. Let the request return JSON, consume it using javascript, render HTML accordingly. Advantage: easier to 'OO-ify' the javascript making the request. Disadvantage: Probably not as easy to use as the previous two options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The fact is that an exception of any kind indicates that something has gone wrong, and you have to sort it out before continuing otherwise you may end up with data integrity problems and other bugs that are not so easy to track down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give one example, in one project I implemented an exception type called CriticalException. This indicates an error condition that requires intervention by the developers and/or administrative staff otherwise customers get incorrectly billed, or other data integrity problems might result. It can also be used in other similar cases when merely logging the exception is not sufficient, and an e-mail alert needs to be sent out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another developer who didn't properly understand the concept of exceptions then wrapped some code that could potentially throw this exception in a generic try...catch block which discarded all exceptions. Fortunately, I spotted it, but it could have resulted in serious problems, especially since the "very uncommon" corner case that it was supposed to catch turned out to be a lot more common than I anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in general, catching generic exceptions is bad unless you are 100% sure that you know &lt;strong&gt;exactly&lt;/strong&gt; which kinds of exceptions will be thrown and under which circumstances. If in doubt, let them bubble up to the top level exception handler instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar rule here is never throw exceptions of type System.Exception. You (or another developer) may want to catch your specific exception higher up the call stack while letting others go through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(There is one point to note, however. In .NET 2.0, if a thread encounters any uncaught exceptions it unloads your whole app domain. So you should wrap the main body of a thread in a generic try...catch block and pass any exceptions caught there to your global exception handling code.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on your additional information I think using the technique above, specifically resolving the references to an assembly yourself is the only real approach that is going to work without restructuring your app. What it gives you is that the location of each and every assembly that the CLR fails to resolve can be determined and loaded by your code at runtime...

Exceptions are preferable as they can be thrown up to the top of the service layer from anywhere inside the service layer, no matter how deeply nested inside the service method implementation it is. This keeps the service code clean as you know the calling presenter will always get notification of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't catch Exception&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21938/is-it-really-that-bad-to-catch-a-general-exception" rel="nofollow"&gt;don't catch Exception&lt;/a&gt; in the presenter, I know its tempting because it keeps the code shorter, but you need to catch specific exceptions to avoid catching the system-level exceptions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan a Simple Exception Hierarchy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are going to use exceptions in this way, you should design an exception hierarchy for your own exception classes. 
At a minumum create a ServiceLayerException class and throw one of these in your service methods when a problem occurs. Then if you need to throw an exception that should/could be handled differently by the presenter, you can throw a specific subclass of ServiceLayerException: say, AccountAlreadyExistsException.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your presenter then has the option of doing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;try {
  // call service etc.
  // handle success to view
} 
catch (AccountAlreadyExistsException) {
  // set the message and some other unique data in the view
}
catch (ServiceLayerException) {
  // set the message in the view
}
// system exceptions, and unrecoverable exceptions are allowed to bubble 
// up the call stack so a general error can be shown to the user, rather 
// than showing the form again.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using inheritance in your own exception classes means you are not required to catch multipile exceptions in your presenter -- you can if there's a need to -- and you don't end up accidentally catching exceptions you can't handle. If your presenter is already at the top of the call stack, add a catch( Exception ) block to handle the system errors with a different view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always try and think of my service layer as a seperate distributable library, and throw as specific an exception as makes sense. It is then up to the presenter/controller/remote-service implementation to decide if it needs to worry about the specific details or just to treat problems as a generic error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authentication issues apply just as much to OpenID as registering on any website.  You put your trust in the website with your password (assuming you do not use a password storage program) so that shouldn't be used against OpenID.&lt;/p&gt;

I do this so I won't end up with any design-specific markup and so I can focus on the semantic meaning of the elements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some pointers how to markup things: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;menu - use the UL (unordered list) element, since that's exactly what a menu is. an unordered list of choices. example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ul id="menu"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li id="home"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href="/" title="Go to Homepage"&amp;gt;Home&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li id="about"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href="/about" title="More about us"&amp;gt;About&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if you'd like an horizontal menu you could do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#menu li {
    display: block;
    float: left;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logo - use a H1 (heading) element for the logo instead of an image.Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div id="header"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;My website&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the CSS (same technique can be applied to the menu above if you would like a menu with graphical items):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#header h1 {
    display: block;
    text-indent: -9999em;
    width: 200px;
    height: 100px;
    background: transparent url(images/logo.png) no-repeat;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDs and classes - use IDs to identify elements that you only have one instance of. Use class for identifying elements that you got several instances of. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use a textual browser (for instance, lynx). If it makes sense to navigate in this way, you've done good when it comes to accessibility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps :)&lt;/p&gt;

I encountered one last night when working with Master Pages: my &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;asp:BulletedList ID="nav"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, when converted into HTML, became &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ul id="ct100_nav"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other issues--I noticed that when you auto-populate a DataGrid, it adds attributes to the resulting table that I don't necessarily want there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that there is a certain amount of "convention over configuration" that you have to accept when you rely on a framework to take over some of your tedious duties, but the "conventions" in these cases aren't so much any established conventions, but rather unnecessary extras. I know &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the ID adds the prefix, but I should be able to tweak and turn things like this off, especially since, as a bit of a web standards evangelist, I don't duplicated HTML id's in a single page anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the question here is for those ASP.NET devs more seasoned than I: in your experiences in developing and deploying apps, how do you leverage these controls? Do you find yourself resorting back to hard-coded HTML? Do you use a blend? I don't want to design my HTML around idiosyncratic quirks in these controls, but, if possible, I'd like to leverage them when possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's a boy to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The page title is a top level heading &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether you make the site title or actual page title the h1 is up to you - personally I'd make About Us the h1 rather than Stack Overflow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The navigation is a table of contents, and thus an &lt;strong&gt;ordered list&lt;/strong&gt; - you may as well use an ol over a ul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Section headers are h2, sections within those sections are h3s etc. Stack them up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use blockquotes and quotes where possible. Don't just surround it with ".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't use b and i. Use strong and em. This is because HTML is structural rather than presentational markup. &lt;strong&gt;Strong&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;em&lt;/strong&gt;phasis tags should be used where you'd put emphasis on the word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;label&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; your form elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;acronym&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;abbr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s where possible, but only in the first instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The easiest: always, &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; give your images some alternate text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's lots of HTML tags you could use that you probably haven't - address for postal addresses, screen code output. Have a look at &lt;a href="http://www.htmldog.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;HTML Dog&lt;/a&gt; for some, it's my favourite reference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's just a few pointers, I'm sure I could think of more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if you want a challenge write your XHTML first, then write the CSS. When CSS-ing you aren't allowed to touch the HTML. It's actually harder than you think (but I've found it's made me quicker).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If you are using Delphi 2007, try removing the line from the project source file that sets the Application.MainFormOnTaskBar boolean variable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With this removed, you should be able to use the various Form's BringToFront / SendToBack methods to achieve the Z-ordering that you are after.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the standard ASP.NET controls are fine for inhouse stuff - quick and dirty is good in that scenario. But, I once worked with a web developer who was also a designer and he refused to use the ASP.NET controls and only code in HTML and add runat="server" tags when needed. This was more because he wanted to know exactly how his HTML was going to be rendered, and at the time anyway, some of the ASP.NET controls wouldn't render to standards compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sit somewhere in the middle - use HTML where appropriate and not when not. You can sort of best of both worlds with the &lt;a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/05/02/444850.aspx"&gt;CSS control Adapters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For a pseudo terminal pair such as
  ptyp3 and ttyp3, the pty... is the
  master or controlling terminal and the
  tty... is the slave. There are only 16
  ttyp's: ttyp0-ttypf (f is a
  hexadecimal digit). &lt;strong&gt;To get more
  pairs, the 3 letters q, r, s may be
  used instead of p&lt;/strong&gt;. For example the
  pair ttys8, ptys8 is a pseudo terminal
  pair. The master and slave are really
  the same "port" but the slave is used
  by the application program and the
  master is used by a network program
  (or the like) which supplies (and
  gets) data to/from the slave port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, with a complex enough regexp, i believe this can be impossible. But you should be able to put something together for simple regexps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you take a look at the source code of the class java.util.regex.Pattern, you'll see that it uses an internal representation of Node instances. Each of the different pattern components have their own implementation of a Node subclass. These Nodes are organised into a tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By producing a visitor that traverses this tree, you should be able to call an overloaded generator method or some kind of Builder that cobbles something together.&lt;/p&gt;

The exception to this rule is whenever a shorter length will not fit in what is left of the 5m length of aluminium extrusion, I use the longest shorter length that will fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to produce a very efficient (very little off cut waste) cutting list and doesn't take long to calculate.

  &lt;p&gt;Django models have a default &lt;strong&gt;str&lt;/strong&gt;() method that calls &lt;strong&gt;unicode&lt;/strong&gt;() and converts the result to a UTF-8 bytestring. This means that unicode(p) will return a Unicode string, and str(p) will return a normal string, with characters encoded as UTF-8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I'm confused because afaik Unicode is not any particular representation, so what is a "Unicode string" in Python? Does that mean UCS-2? Googling turned up &lt;a href="http://www.reportlab.com/i18n/python_unicode_tutorial.html"&gt;this "Python Unicode Tutorial"&lt;/a&gt; which boldly states&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Spolsky:  Yep.  There's a new product also, if you don't want to use the Team System there our friends at Redgate have a product called SQL Data Generator [&lt;a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/sql_data_generator/index.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.red-gate.com/products/sql_data_generator/index.htm&lt;/a&gt;].  It's $295, and it just generates some realistic test data.  And it does things like actually generate real cities in the city column that actually exist, and then when it generates those it'll get the state right, instead of getting the state wrong, or putting states into German cities and stuff like... you know, it generates pretty realistic looking data.  I'm not really sure what all the features are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably not what you are looking for, but it might be a good starting off point, instead of creating your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't seem to find anything in google, so I would suggest tackling the problem by parsing a given regular expression into the smallest units of work (\w, [x-x], \d, etc) and writing some basic methods to support those regular expression phrases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for \w you would have a method getRandomLetter() which returns any random letter, and you would also have getRandomLetter(char startLetter, char endLetter) which gives you a random letter between the two values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
UTF-8 (8-bit UCS/Unicode Transformation Format) is a &lt;strong&gt;variable-length character encoding for Unicode. It is able to represent any character in the Unicode standard&lt;/strong&gt;, yet the initial encoding of byte codes and character assignments for UTF-8 is backwards compatible with ASCII. For these reasons, it is steadily becoming the preferred encoding for e-mail, web pages[1], and other places where characters are stored or streamed.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it's anywhere between one and four bytes depending on which character you wish to represent within the realm of Unicode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode" rel="nofollow"&gt;From Wikipedia on Unicode:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In computing, Unicode is an industry standard allowing computers to consistently represent and manipulate text expressed in &lt;strong&gt;most of the world's writing systems&lt;/strong&gt;. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it's able to represent most (but not all) of the world's writing systems. &lt;/p&gt;

However, in this case there's no interface that the user sees and when he visits a URL on your server he would get the response you constructed in your own handler.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cmd.Fill(products, r =&amp;gt; r.GetProduct());
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where "products" is the IList&amp;lt;Product&amp;gt; you want to populate, and "GetProduct" contains the logic to create a Product instance from a data reader. It won't help with this specific problem of not having all the fields present, but if you're doing a lot of old-fashioned ADO.NET like this it can be quite handy.&lt;/p&gt;

On a small-to-medium project it might seem like an overhead to synchronize code and CSS/HTML and make them standards-compliant and clean. A designer's way to do that is to have full control over rendered HTML. But there's many ways to have that full control in ASP.NET. And for me, having the required HTML in the aspx/ascx file is the most non-scalable and dirty way to do it. If you want to style controls through CSS, you can always set a class server-side through the CssClass property. If you want to access them through JS, you can emit the JS with right IDs server-side again. The only disadvantage that this provides is that a dev and a designer have to work together closely. On any large project this is unavoidable anyway. But the advantages ASP.NET provides far outnumber these difficulties.
Still, if you want standards-compliant HTML, skinning support and other goodies to control rendered markup, you can always use thrid-party controls.&lt;/p&gt;

  Python?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python 'knows' that your string is Unicode. Hence if you do regex on it, it will know which is character and which is not etc, which is really helpful. If you did a strlen it will also give the correct result. As an example if you did string count on Hello, you will get 5 (even if it's Unicode). But if you did a string count of a foreign word and that string was not a Unicode string than you will have much larger result. Pythong uses the information form the Unicode Character Database to identify each character in the Unicode String. Hope that helps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that's not a problem. Refactoring is about changing design without changing function (I hope I haven't corrupted the meaning too badly there) so you can work in a much broader fashion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start out with big chunks. Set up a repeatable execution, and capture what happens as the expected result for subsequent executions. Now you have your app, or part of it at least, under test. Not a very good or comprehensive test, sure, but it's a start and things can only get better from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can start to refactor. You want to start extracting your data access code so that it can be replaced with ORM functionality without disturbing too much. Test often: with legacy apps you'll be surprised what breaks; cohesion and coupling are seldom what they might be.&lt;/p&gt;

However, one big difference between the Java and Python approaches is that with reference counting in the common case (no circular references) objects are cleaned up immediately rather than at some indeterminate later date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I can write sloppy, non-portable code in CPython such as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def parse_some_attrs(fname):
    return open(fname).read().split("~~~")[2:4]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the file descriptor for that file I opened will be cleaned up immediately because as soon as the reference to the open file goes away, the file is garbage collected and the file descriptor is freed.  Of course, if I run Jython or IronPython or possibly PyPy, then the garbage collector won't necessarily run until much later; possibly I'll run out of file descriptors first and my program will crash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you SHOULD be writing code that looks like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def parse_some_attrs(fname):
    with open(fname) as f:
        return f.read().split("~~~")[2:4]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but sometimes people like to rely on reference counting to always free up their resources because it can sometimes make your code a little shorter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd say that the best garbage collector is the one with the best performance, which currently seems to be the Java-style generational garbage collectors that can run in a separate thread and has all these crazy optimizations, etc.  The differences to how you write your code should be negligible and ideally non-existent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works quite well.  No Javascript needed, just CSS and HTML.  With minimal HTML interfering with the other stuff. It's very similar to what Mono posted, but doesn't contain any IE 6 specific hacks, and after checking, doesn't seem to work at all.  Also, another trick is to make the inside portion of each corner image transparent so it doesn't block text that is near the corner.  The outer portion must not be transparent so it can cover up the border of the non-rounded div. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, once CSS3 is widely supported with border-radius, that will be the official best way of making rounded corners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's slower to access than the disk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your server will need to run a script to get to the image instead
of simply serving a file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your script now is responsible for a lot of stuff the web server used
to handle:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting the proper Content-Type header&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting the proper caching/timeout/E-tag headers, so clients can properly cache the image. If do not do this properly, the image serving script will be hit on every request, increasing the load on the server even more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only advantage I can see is that you don't need to keep your database and image files synchronized. I would still recommend against it though.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;OpenID of course doesn't solve that problem. For example, if I use OpenID to sign in to StackOverflow, it doesn't mean I don't need to sign in to another website again using the same openID. -- tj9991&lt;/p&gt;

  a WCF client about changes? (Better
  solution then simple polling, e.g.
  Coment or long polling)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to use push-technology with WCF through client firewalls. This must be a common problem, and I know for a fact it works in theory (see links below), but I have failed to get it working, and I haven't been able to find a code sample that demonstrates it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Requirements: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WCF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clients connects to server through tcp port 80 (netTcpBinding).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server pushes back information at irregular intervals (1 min to several hours).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users should not have to configure their firewalls, server pushes must pass through firewalls that have all inbound ports closed. TCP duplex on the same connection is needed for this, a dual binding does not work since a port has to be opened on the client firewall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clients sends heartbeats to server at regular intervals (perhaps every 15 mins) so server knows client is still alive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server is IIS7 with WAS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution seems to be duplex netTcpBinding. Based on this information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/drnick/archive/2006/05/01/configuring-wcf-for-nats-and-firewalls.aspx"&gt;WCF through firewalls and NATs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I have yet to find a code sample that works.. I've tried combining the "Duplex" and "TcpActivation" samples from Microsoft's WCF Samples without any luck. Please can someone point me to example code that works, or build a small sample app. Thanks a lot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to force your assemblies to work in 32 bit mode, but this requires patching the CLR header, (there is a tool that does that in the Framework) and if your assemblies are strongly-named, this does not work out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could either call out to tail and retrieve the stream back into your app, or as it's open source, maybe try to pull it into your own code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it is possible in C++ iostream to open a file for viewing only and just read to the end, while buffering the last 10-20 lines, then output that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For guidelines, here's an extract from my own guide on naming open source projects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the name you're thinking of is directly pulled from a scifi or fantasy source, don't bother. These sources are WAY overrepresented as naming sources in software. Not only are your chances of coming up with something original pretty small, most of the names of characters and places in scifi are trademarked and you run the risk of being sued.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the name you're thinking of comes straight from Greek, Roman or Norse mythology, try again. We've got more than enough mail related software called variations of "Mercury".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run your proposed name through Google. The fewer results you get the better. If you get down to no results, you're there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't try to get a unique name by just slightly misspelling something. Calling your new Windows filesystem program Phat32 is just going to end up with users getting frustrated looking at the results of "fat32" in a search engine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your name couldn't be said on TV in the 50s or 60s, you're probably on the wrong track. This is particularly true if you would like anyone to use your product in a work environment. No one is going to recommend a product to their co-workers if they can get sued for sexual harassment just for uttering its name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your product name can't be pronounced at all, you'll get no word of mouth benefit at all. Similarly, if no one knows how to pronounce it, they will not be very likely to try to say it out loud to ask questions about it, etc. How do YOU say MySQL? PostgreSQL? GNU? Almost all spoken languages on Earth are based on consonant/vowel syllables of some sort. Alternating between consonants and vowels is a pretty good way to ensure that someone can pronounce it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The shorter the better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See if the .com domain is available. If it's not, it's a pretty good indicator that someone has already thought of it and is using it or closer to using it than you are. Do this even if you don't intend to use the domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't build inherent limitations on your product into the name. Calling your product LinProduct or WinProduct precludes you from ever releasing any sort of cross-platform edition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't use your own name for open source products. If the project lives on beyond your involvement, the project will either have to be renamed or your name may be used in ways you didn't intend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't create simple delegates explicitly in code like that unless you're pre-2.0 so you could use: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-cs prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;   BeginInvoke(new EventHandler&amp;lt;CoolObjectEventArgs&amp;gt;(mCoolObject_CoolEvent),

               args);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also you don't need to create and populate the object array because the args parameter is a "params" type so you can just pass in the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would probably favor &lt;code&gt;Invoke&lt;/code&gt; over &lt;code&gt;BeginInvoke&lt;/code&gt; as the latter will result in the code being called asynchronously which may or may not be what you're after but would make handling subsequent exceptions difficult to propagate without a call to &lt;code&gt;EndInvoke&lt;/code&gt;. What would happen is that your app will end up getting a &lt;code&gt;TargetInvocationException&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

But if you want something like a tree or heap I don't think they exist by default but I'm sure there are free libraries anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To have an array emulate a stack use &lt;code&gt;array_push()&lt;/code&gt; to add and &lt;code&gt;array_pop()&lt;/code&gt; to take off&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An associative array is a hash by default.  In PHP they are allowed to have strings as indexes so this works as expected:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$array['key'] = 'value';
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you can kind of emulate a binary tree with an array with the potential to have wasted space.  Its useful if you know you're going to have a small tree.  Using a linear array, you say for any index (i) you put its left child at index (2i+1) and right child at index (2i+2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these methods are covered nicely in &lt;a href="http://javascript-reference.info/9-javascript-tips-you-may-not-know.htm"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; on how to make JavaScript arrays emulate higher level data structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years ago I inherited a similar application.  It's large, in PHP, very old, and difficult to add new functionality to.  About 18 months ago I was able to switch out most of the "framework" with a new version and that solved lots of my problems.  It only took about a year of tweaking calls to a handful of page template and library calls to make it fairly easy to swap the older bad code for some better stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app is mostly just very custom reports and forms and there are some really old pages.  To give you and idea, one of the oldest reports has a page id of 3 while the login page has a page id of about 100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date I've probably added 25k lines but I'd bet that 80% of the original 6000 or so lines are still there (more or less)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can get away with slowly evolving the program because I spend an hour or two every day working on it. The other approach that comes to mind would be to make new, fancy, modules that sit beside the existing code and operate on the same data.  All you have to do then is tie into some session and permission data but otherwise those pages are separate.  If that's the better framework to work in then future updates will all be made in the new "side" of the app possibly eventually leading to a migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even if you eventually migrate to a new framework you should be able to preserve most of older pages.. ideally you'd just replace the files &amp;amp; functions loaded at the top and bottom of a file while leaving the rest almost unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Simple Example:
Certain pages on my site are only accessible to logged in users. I have two options for implementation (there are others but let's limit it to these two)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create an authenticate.php file and include it on every page. It holds the logic for authentication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a user object, which has an authenticate function, reference the object for authentication on every page. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;
I'd like to see some way weigh the benefits of one over the other. 
My current (and weak reasons) follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Includes - Sometimes a function is just easier/shorter/faster to call
Objects - Grouping of functionality and properties leads for longer term maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Includes - Less code to write (no constructor, no class syntax) call me lazy but this is true.
Objects - Force formality and a single approach to functions and creation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Includes - Easier for a novice to deal with
Objects - Harder for novices, but frowned upon by professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look at these factors at the start of a project to decide if I want to do includes or objects.
Those are a few pros and cons off the top of my head.&lt;/p&gt;

I'll elaborate a bit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To synchronize the database structure, we have a single script, update.php, and a number of files numbered 1.sql, 2.sql, 3.sql, etc. The script uses one extra table to store the current version number of the database. The N.sql files are crafted by hand, to go from version (N-1) to version N of the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can be used to add tables, add columns, migrate data from an old to a new column format then drop the column, insert "master" data rows such as user types, etc. Basically, it can do anything, and with proper data migration scripts you'll never lose data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The update script works like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect to the database.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make a backup of the current database (because stuff &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; go wrong) [mysqldump].&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create bookkeeping table (called _meta) if it doesn't exist.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read current VERSION from _meta table. Assume 0 if not found.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For all .sql files numbered higher than VERSION, execute them in order&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If one of the files produced an error: roll back to the backup&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Otherwise, update the version in the bookkeeping table to the highest .sql file executed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything goes into source control, and every installation has a script to update to the latest version with a single script execution (calling update.php with the proper database password etc.). We SVN update staging and production environments via a script that automatically calls the database update script, so a code update comes with the necessary database updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also use the same script to recreate the entire database from scratch; we just drop and recreate the database, then run the script which will completely repopulate the database. We can also use the script to populate an empty database for automated testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took only a few hours to set up this system, it's conceptually simple and everyone gets the version numbering scheme, and it has been invaluable in having the ability to move forward and evolving the database design, without having to communicate or manually execute the modifications on all databases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beware when pasting queries from phpMyAdmin though!&lt;/em&gt; Those generated queries usually include the database name, which you definitely don't want since it will break your scripts! Something like CREATE TABLE &lt;code&gt;mydb&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;code&gt;newtable&lt;/code&gt;(...) will fail if the database on the system is not called mydb. We created a pre-comment SVN hook that will disallow .sql files containing the &lt;code&gt;mydb&lt;/code&gt; string, which is a sure sign that someone copy/pasted from phpMyAdmin without proper checking.&lt;/p&gt;

My current solution, which sucks, is to send the datetimes into a UDF to convert them to midnight of the same day, and then check those dates for equality.  When it comes to the query plan, this is a disaster, as are almost all UDFs in joins or where clauses.  This is one of the only places in my application that I haven't been able to root out the functions and give the query optimizer something it can actually use to locate the best index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, merging the function code back into the query seems impractical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I am missing something simple here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the function for reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if not exists (select * from dbo.sysobjects 
              where id = object_id(N'dbo.f_MakeDate') and               
              type in (N'FN', N'IF', N'TF', N'FS', N'FT'))
  exec('create function dbo.f_MakeDate() returns int as 
         begin declare @retval int return @retval end')
go

alter function dbo.f_MakeDate
(
    @Day datetime, 
    @Hour int, 
    @Minute int
)
returns datetime
as

/*

Creates a datetime using the year-month-day portion of @Day, and the 
@Hour and @Minute provided

*/

begin

declare @retval datetime
set @retval = cast(
    cast(datepart(m, @Day) as varchar(2)) + 
    '/' + 
    cast(datepart(d, @Day) as varchar(2)) + 
    '/' + 
    cast(datepart(yyyy, @Day) as varchar(4)) + 
    ' ' + 
    cast(@Hour as varchar(2)) + 
    ':' + 
    cast(@Minute as varchar(2)) as datetime)
return @retval
end

go
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complicate matters, I am joining on time zone tables to check the date against the local time, which could be different for every row:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;where 
dbo.f_MakeDate(dateadd(hh, tz.Offset + 
    case when ds.LocalTimeZone is not null 
    then 1 else 0 end, t.TheDateINeedToCheck), 0, 0) = @activityDateMidnight
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Edit]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm incorporating @Todd's suggestion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;where datediff(day, dateadd(hh, tz.Offset + 
    case when ds.LocalTimeZone is not null 
    then 1 else 0 end, t.TheDateINeedToCheck), @ActivityDate) = 0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My misconception about how datediff works (the same day of year in consecutive years yields 366, not 0 as I expected) caused me to waste a lot of effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the query plan didn't change.  I think I need to go back to the drawing board with the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;opendir(DIR, $somedir) || die "Can't open directory $somedir: $!";
@dots = grep { (!/^\./) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; -f "$somedir/$_" } readdir(DIR);
closedir DIR;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, to document what it's doing since the poster didn't: it's passing the returned list from &lt;a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/readdir.html"&gt;readdir()&lt;/a&gt; through a &lt;a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/grep.html"&gt;grep()&lt;/a&gt; that only returns those values that are files (as opposed to directories, devices, named pipes, etc.) and that do not begin with a dot (which makes the list name &lt;code&gt;@dots&lt;/code&gt; misleading, but that's due to the change he made when copying it over from the readdir() documentation). Since it limits the contents of the directory it returns, I don't think it's technically a correct answer to this question, but it illustrates a common idiom used to filter filenames in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl"&gt;Perl&lt;/a&gt;, and I thought it would be valuable to document. Another example seen a lot is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;@list = grep !/^\.\.?$/, readdir(D);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This snippet reads all contents from the directory handle D &lt;strong&gt;except&lt;/strong&gt; '.' and '..', since those are very rarely desired to be used in the listing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've only enabled compression on Windows 2003 server's IIS using this approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Save &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restart IIS (run &lt;code&gt;iisreset&lt;/code&gt;) &lt;/li&gt;

The ExceptionHandler would render the appropriate view for the type of exception. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any validation exceptions however should be handled in the view but typically this logic is common to many parts of your application. So I like to have a helper like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public static class Try {
    public static List&amp;lt;string&amp;gt; This( Action action ) {
      var errors = new List&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;();
      try {
        action();
      }
      catch ( SpecificException e ) {
        errors.Add( "Something went 'orribly wrong" );
      }
      catch ( ... )
      // ...
     return errors;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then when calling your service just do the following&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var errors = Try.This( () =&amp;gt; {
  // call your service here
  tasks.CreateMember( ... );
} );
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in errors is empty, you're good to go.&lt;/p&gt;

If you are using Sybase or SQL Server 2008 you can create variables of type date and assign them your datetime values. The database engine gets rid of the time for you. Here's a quick and dirty test to illustrate (Code is in Sybase dialect):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;declare @date1 date
declare @date2 date
set @date1='2008-1-1 10:00'
set @date2='2008-1-1 22:00'
if @date1=@date2
    print 'Equal'
else
    print 'Not equal'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For SQL 2005 and earlier what you can do is convert the date to a varchar in a format that does not have the time component. For instance the following returns 2008.08.22&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;select convert(varchar,'2008-08-22 18:11:14.133',102)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 102 part specifies the formatting (Books online can list for you all the available formats)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what you can do is write a function that takes a datetime and extracts the date element and discards the time. Like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;create function MakeDate (@InputDate datetime) returns datetime as
begin
    return cast(convert(varchar,@InputDate,102) as datetime);
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can then use the function for companions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2bc0cxhc.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2bc0cxhc.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Runtime Security Policy&lt;/em&gt; section you'll find 3 policy levels: Enterprise, Machine and User.  If you drill into Machine or User you'll find definitions of &lt;em&gt;Code Groups&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Permission Sets&lt;/em&gt; .  When you say that you want to test some .NET code in partial trust environments, I guess you'll want to test against one of the standard permission sets already defined, such as &lt;em&gt;Internet&lt;/em&gt; .  You need to define a &lt;em&gt;Code Group&lt;/em&gt; that matches your app (or specific assemblies) and assign your chosen permission set to that &lt;em&gt;Code Group&lt;/em&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can define your own custom &lt;em&gt;Permission Sets&lt;/em&gt; too, but let's keep it simple for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose whether you want your new code group to exist at machine-wide scope, or just for your user account, and drill into the Machine or User policy level accordingly.  You'll see a code group called &lt;em&gt;All _ Code&lt;/em&gt; .  Create a child code group inside that one, by right-clicking and selecting &lt;em&gt;New...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give it a name, say &lt;em&gt;PartialTrustGroup&lt;/em&gt; , then click &lt;em&gt;Next&lt;/em&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to specify a membership condition for this group, and there are various types.  I like to create a specific folder called &lt;em&gt;PartialTrust&lt;/em&gt; on my machine, and then create a URL membership condition that matches.  So, my URL looks like this...
file://c:/users/martin/documents/partialtrust/*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The * is a wildcard to catch any assembly beneath that path.  Click &lt;em&gt;Next&lt;/em&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can pick a permission set for your new code group.  For now, pick &lt;em&gt;Internet&lt;/em&gt; .  It's quite a restrictive set, similar to a Java applet sandbox.  Click &lt;em&gt;Next&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Finish&lt;/em&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now right-click on your new code-group and select Properties.  In the General tab, ensure the topmost checkbox is selected, then click OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, any .NET assemblies that are loaded from a location beneath the URL you specified will have the &lt;em&gt;Internet&lt;/em&gt; permission set applied to them.  Expect to get some SecurityExceptions if you haven't written your code to carefully observe the reduced permission set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry this is a long description.  It really is a lot more simple than it sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Store the local time for each mail action into the database, then convert on-the-fly. Send mail when SERVER&lt;em&gt;UTC&lt;/em&gt;TIME() == TO&lt;em&gt;UTC&lt;/em&gt;TIME(storedLocalTime, userTimeZone).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should decide what makes most sense for your application. For example if the mailing time is always the same for all users, it makes more sense to go with option (2). If the events times can change between users and even per user, it may make development and debugging easier if you choose option (1). Either way you will need to know the user's time zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*These function calls are obviously pseudo, since I don't know their invocations in T-SQL, but they should exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Any personal experience in overcoming web application performance hurdles? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any recommended strategies for improving the performance of a data-driven web application? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My development team works on a web application (JSP reports, HTML, JavaScript) that uses an Oracle database (PL/SQL). The key functionality the application delivers is in reporting, where a user can get PDFs of reports at a high level and drill down to lower levels of supporting details. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the number of supporting detail records has grown into the millions, the performance of the system has significantly degraded. Based on our current analysis of the metrics, the bottleneck seems to be in the logic hitting the DB and the DB performance. Changing the DB model and re-doing some of the server side logic is currently being explored.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partioning, indexing, explain plans, and running statistics are things that have been done on the DB side to try to help improve performance. While they've helped, they haven't solved the issue satisfactorily. The toughest part in analyzing performance data is that the database and web servers are remotely administered by a different part of the IT organization, so the developers don't have regular, full access to see what's going on (especially in the production environment, which is not mirrored exactly in any other development/testing environment).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;64-bit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vista has a 64-bit edition, and although XP did too, your users are more likely to use Vista 64 than XP 64.  Now you have to deal with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New APIs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are new APIs which are targeted at either new methods of application construction or allowing new functionality:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa376210%28VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cryptography API: Next Generation&lt;/a&gt; (CNG)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because installations can only use common runtimes they install after a transaction has completed, &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/archive/2007/05/20/2760317.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;custom actions&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/archive/2007/01/09/problems-with-custom-actions-that-depend-on-the-visual-c-8-0-runtime-files-on-windows-vista.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;will fail&lt;/a&gt; if your custom action dll requires the Visual C++ runtimes above the VS 2005 CRT (non-SP1).&lt;/p&gt;

Based on your traffic estimates, you have close to 200 writes per second. With MyISAM, &lt;em&gt;only one of these could be in progress at any time&lt;/em&gt;. You have to make sure that your hardware can keep up with these transaction to avoid being overrun, i.e., a single query can take no more than 5ms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That suggests to me you would need a storage engine which supports row-level locking, i.e., InnoDB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it should be fairly trivial to write a few simple scripts to simulate the load with each storage engine, then compare the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be worth it to take a step back from the code and examine the usage patterns of the system.  For example, if you are showing people monthly inventory or sales information do they look at it at only at the end of the month?  If so just build the data on the last day and store it.  If they look at it daily, maybe try building each previous days results and storing the results and avoid the calculation.

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use a profiler.&lt;/strong&gt; Yes they cost money, and using them can occasionally be a bit awkward, but they do provide you with a great deal more real evidence rather than guesswork.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Human beings are universally bad at guessing where performance bottlenecks are. It just seems to be something our brains aren't build to do very well. It may seem obvious, you may have great ideas about what the problem is, but the real world often turns out to be doing something different. And optimising the wrong part of code means, at best, lots of work for minimal benefit. More often it makes things slower, and sometimes it breaks things entirely. So before you make any changes for the sake of optimisation, you should always have real evidence from a profiler or other accurate tool.&lt;/p&gt;

  def (*args)

y = (1, 45, ...)

&lt;p&gt;That being said, profilers are definitely the way to go.  That way you can see where your program is spending most of its time, and not focus on things that you think are slow.  Plus it means you don't have to write anything in your code to actually record the metrics.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I hinted to at the beginning, there are different types of profilers.  The three I find most useful are application profilers, which let you see which functions you actually spend most of your time in.  The second is SQL profilers that let you see how long your queries take to run.  The third is memory profilers, which help to show you what type of objects your memory is being used up by.  All three of these are really useful, and although you won't use them every day, the times you do use them will save you a lot of headache.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I do store all dates in GMT. Here's the use case: something happened at 11:00 PM EST on the 1st, which is the 2nd GMT. I want to see activity for the 1st, and I am in EST so I will want to see the 11PM activity. If I just compared raw GMT datetimes, I would miss things. Each row in the report can represent an activity from a different time zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right, but when you say you're interested in activity for Jan 1st 2008 EST:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT @activityDateMidnight = '1/1/2008', @activityDateTZ = 'EST'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you just need to convert &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; to GMT (I'm ignoring the complication of querying for the day before EST goes to EDT, or vice versa):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Table: TimeZone
Fields: TimeZone, Offset
Values: EST, -4

--Multiply by -1, since we're converting EST to GMT.
--Offsets are to go from GMT to EST.
SELECT @activityGmtBegin = DATEADD(hh, Offset * -1, @activityDateMidnight)
FROM TimeZone
WHERE TimeZone = @activityDateTZ
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which should give you '1/1/2008 4:00 AM'. Then, you can just search in GMT:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event in question is stored with a GMT EventTime of 1/2/2008 3:00 AM. You don't even need the TimeZone in the EventTable (for this purpose, at least). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since EventTime is not in a function, this is a straight index scan - which should be pretty efficient. Make EventTime your clustered index, and it'll fly. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I'd have the app convert the search time into GMT before running the query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be attractive to compute a simple similarity between tags based on frequency: 'subversion' and 'svn' appear very often together, so requesting 'svn' would return SVN-related questions, but also the rare questions only tagged 'subversion' (and vice versa). However, 'java' and 'c#' also appear often together, but for very different reasons (they are not synonyms). So similarity based on frequency is out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An answer to this problem might be a mix of mechanisms, as the ones suggested in this Q/A thread:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filtering out typos by suggesting tags when the user inputs them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintaining a user-generated map of synonyms. This map may not be that big if it just targets synonyms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allowing multi-tag search, such that the user can put 'subversion svn' or 'subversion &amp;amp;&amp;amp; svn' (well, from programmers to programmers) in the search box and get both. This would be quite practical as many users may actually try such approach when they do not know which term is the most meaningful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Nick: Agreed. The question is not meant to argue against tags. Tags have great potential, but users will face a growing issue if one cannot search 'across' tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Steve: Maintaining an ever-growing &lt;em&gt;map&lt;/em&gt; of tags is definitely not practical. As SO is accumulating an ever-growing &lt;em&gt;bag&lt;/em&gt; of tags, how could we shade some light on this bag to make search of Q/A tags even more useful, in a convenient way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Espo: 'Ajax-powered' tag suggestions based on existing tags is apparently available on SO when creating a question. This is by the way very helpful to choose tags and appropriate spelling (avoiding the 'subversion' vs. 'sbversion' issue from Steve).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, using this mechanism means you are going to have scaling problems. I think more reliable solution is to queue up information and have your clients poll for them regularly. Utilize caching if possible such that a subsequent client poll will get the cached data from the customers proxy cache, if they are using one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have to push data in a timely manner, in sub-second land (i.e. financial services), then consider some messaging infrastructure such an NServiceBus distributor on client side, but that will require a customer install...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So have you tried using Toredo? Having read that it would appear there it is prob too complicated for a user to setup.&lt;/p&gt;

I do understand that there are very valid reasons to put logic into the database. However, it depends on the type of application and the way it handles data which approach you should choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, a typical data entry app like some customer (or xyz) management will massively benefit from using an ORM layer as there are not so many different views at the data and you can reduce the boilerplate CRUD code to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, assume you have an application with a lot of concurrency and calculations that span a lot of tables and that has a fine-grained column-level security concept with locking and so on, you're probably better off doing stuff like that directly in the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, it also depends on the variety of views you anticipate for your data. If there are many different combinations of columns and tables that need to be presented to the user, you may also be better off just handing back different result sets rather than map your objects one-by-one to another representation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, the database is good at dealing with sets, whereas OO code is good at dealing with single entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;while - This is used to loop until you meet a condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the three, "while" will most likely provide the best performance in most situations.  Of course, if you do something like the following, you are basically rewriting the "for" loop  (which in c# is slightly more performant).&lt;/p&gt;

As a programmer, you'll want to avoid TSQL and such "Database languages" as much as possible, because they are horrendous, difficult to debug, not extensible and there's nothing you can do with them that you won't be able to do using code on your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only reasons I see &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; writing stored procedures are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your database isn't great (think how SQL Server doesn't implement LIMIT and you have to work around that using a procedure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to be able to change a behaviour by changing code in just one place without re-deploying your client applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The client machines have &lt;strong&gt;big&lt;/strong&gt; calculation-power constraints (think small embedded devices).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most applications though, you should try to keep your code in the application where you can debug it, keep it under version control and fix it using all the tools provided to you by your language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad heap usage, i.e., double frees, read after free, write after free, setting the HEAP&lt;em&gt;NO&lt;/em&gt;SERIALIZE flag with allocs and frees from multiple threads on the same heap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Out of memory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad code (i.e., buffer overflows, buffer underflows, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Timing" issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it's at all the first two but not the last, you should have caught it by now with either pageheap.exe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which most likely means it is due to how the code is accessing shared memory. Unfortunately, tracking that down is going to be rather painful. Unsynchronized access to shared memory often manifests as weird "timing" issues. Things like not using acquire/release semantics for synchronizing access to shared memory with a flag, not using locks appropriately, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very least, it would help to be able to track allocations somehow, as was suggested earlier. At least then you can view what actually happened up until the heap corruption and attempt to diagnose from that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you can easily redirect allocations to multiple heaps, you might want to try that to see if that either fixes the problem or results in more reproduceable buggy behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you were testing with VS2008, did you run with HeapVerifier with Conserve Memory set to Yes? That might reduce the performance impact of the heap allocator. (Plus, you have to run with it Debug-&gt;Start with Application Verifier, but you may already know that.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also try debugging with Windbg and various uses of the !heap command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So...you have four or five RDP sessions open over the corp VPN, you're bashing away inside your favourite IDE, your VPN to the data centre bounces briefly then recovers, all your RDP sessions start re-establishing their connections and whilst doing so sequentially keep grabbing focus, one after the other. Pretty bloody annoying and downright rude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any idea how to prevent this behaviour and just make the RDP client flash it's taskbar button instead of totally grabbing focus away from whatever you were doing?&lt;/p&gt;

I tried &lt;a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Terminals" rel="nofollow"&gt;Terminals&lt;/a&gt; a few times before, but quite often I need to see two or three sessions side by side which the tabbing doesn't really facilitate too well, would've been nice to have a 'pop out in own window' button. I did once grab the source code to fix stuff like that, but never got the time. I also found it behaved oddly whenever there was a brief network disconnect (e.g. xDSL flapping) and it would reconnect to the wrong session (usually a new one) and leave the session I had opened in a disconnected state on the server. Otherwise Terminals would've been really cool, we have 200+ windows servers, and organising all those .rdp files can be a pain.&lt;/p&gt;

To do that with database code requires a potentially-significant amount of effort to either retrieve the procedure from the database and transfer it to somewhere in the source tree, or to do a database backup every time a minor change is made. In either case (and regardless of the amount of effort), it's not intuitive; and for many shops, it's not a good enough solution either. There is also the potential here for developers who may not be as studious at that as others to forget to retrieve and check in a revision. It's technically possible to put ANYTHING in source control; the disconnect here is what I would take issue with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(re debuggable) Fair enough, though that doesn't provide much integration with the rest of the application (where the majority of the code could live). That may or may not be important.&lt;/p&gt;

In production, they just call the standard malloc and free, but in debug, they can do whatever you want. We also have a simple base class that does nothing but override the new and delete operators to use these functions, then any class you write can simply inherit from that class. If you have a ton of code, it may be a big job to replace calls to malloc and free to the new malloc and free (don't forget realloc!), but in the long run it's very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Steve Maguire's book &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mspress/books/1024.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;Writing Solid Code&lt;/a&gt; (highly recommended), there are examples of debug stuff that you can do in these routines, like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep track of allocations to find leaks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allocate more memory than necessary and put markers at the beginning and end of memory -- during the free routine, you can ensure these markers are still there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;memset the memory with a marker on allocation (to find usage of uninitialized memory) and on free (to find usage of free'd memory)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another good idea is to &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; use things like &lt;code&gt;strcpy&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;strcat&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;sprintf&lt;/code&gt; -- always use &lt;code&gt;strncpy&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;strncat&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;snprintf&lt;/code&gt;. We've written our own versions of these as well, to make sure we don't write off the end of a buffer, and these have caught lots of problems too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only real solution is HTTPS. If you don't want to do SSL on your whole site (maybe you have performance concerns), you might be able to get away with only SSL protecting the sensitive areas. To do that, first make sure your login page is HTTPS. When a user logs in, set a secure cookie (meaning the browser will only transmit it over an SSL link) in addition to the regular session cookie. Then, when a user visits one of your "sensitive" areas, redirect them to HTTPS, and check for the presence of that secure cookie. A real user will have it, a session hijacker will not.&lt;/p&gt;

Stored Procedures are &lt;em&gt;MORE&lt;/em&gt; maintainable because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don't have to recompile your C# app whenever you want to change some SQL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You end up reusing SQL code. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code repetition is the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; thing you can do when you're trying to build a maintainable application!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens when you find a logic error that needs to be corrected in multiple places? You're more apt to forget to change that last spot where you copy &amp;amp; pasted your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the performance &amp;amp; security gains are an added plus. &lt;strong&gt;You can still write insecure/inefficient SQL stored procedures.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Easier to port to another DB - no procs to port&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not very hard to script out all your stored procedures for creation in another DB. In fact - it's &lt;em&gt;easier&lt;/em&gt; than exporting your tables because there are no primary/foreign keys to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;

If you want to retrieve a list of items and it happens once during your application's entire run for example, it's probably not worth the effort of using a stored procedure. On the other hand, a query that runs repeatedly and takes a (relatively) long time to execute is an excellent candidate for database storage, since the performance will be better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your application lives almost entirely within the database, stored procedures are a no-brainer. If you're writing a desktop application to which the database is only tangentially important, ad-hoc queries may be a better option, as it &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22818/where-to-put-your-code-database-vs-application" rel="nofollow"&gt;keeps all of your code in one place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Terrapin: I think your assertion that the fact that you don't have to recompile your app to make modifications makes stored procedures a better option is a non-starter. There may be reasons to choose stored procedures over ad-hoc queries, but in the absence of anything else compelling, the compile issue seems like laziness rather than a real reason. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The routing engine that powers the ASP.NET MVC Framework will work with the traditional ASP.NET Framework.  You can take advantage of using the RouteTable and assigning routes, just like you would in an ASP.NET MVC application.  You just don't get the MVC portion in traditional ASP.NET sites.  That was a huge enhancement for the ASP.NET Framework and it was great to see them reuse that code and make it work in both frameworks.  If you want to learn more about this, check out ScottGu's &lt;a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/05/27/asp-net-mvc-preview-3-release.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; and scroll down to URL Routing Improvements.  Also here is a &lt;a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2008/03/11/using-routing-with-webforms.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;reference&lt;/a&gt; on how to use the System.Web.Routing in WebForms by Phil Haack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you still want to write you own.  You will need to learn the ASP.NET HTTP pipeline and how to implement the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ihttpmodule.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;IHttpModule&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ihttphandler.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;IHttpHandler&lt;/a&gt; interfaces to create your own HttpModule or HttpHandler class to handle your routing.  These interfaces are the key in writing your own routing engine.  To help put those interfaces in a working example, I couldn't recommend this &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms972974.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;MSDN article&lt;/a&gt; enough.  It shows you how to with either interface and explains the differences when creating your own routing/url rewriting engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you find out that this might be to much for you.  There are third party libraries you can use of people who already wrote a routing/url rewriting engine in .NET.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Stored Procedures:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For any complex data work.  If you're going to be doing something truly requiring a cursor or temp tables it's usually fastest to do it within SQL Server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you need to lock down access to the data.  If you don't give table access to users (or role or whatever) you can be sure that the only way to interact with the data is through the SP's you create.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use ad-hoc queries:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For CRUD when you don't need to restrict data access (or are doing so in another manner).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For simple searches.  Creating SP's for a bunch of search criteria is a pain and difficult to maintain.  If you can generate a reasonably fast search query use that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most of my applications I've used both SP's and ad-hoc sql, though I find I'm using SP's less and less as they end up being code just like C#, only harder to version control, test, and maintain.  I would recommend using ad-hoc sql unless you can find a specific reason not to.&lt;/p&gt;

Post.find(1).users_who_read       # =&amp;gt; [&amp;lt;User bob&amp;gt;]

Post.find_unread_by(bob)          # =&amp;gt; [&amp;lt;Post 2&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;Post 3&amp;gt;...]
Post.find_read_by(bob)            # =&amp;gt; [&amp;lt;Post 1&amp;gt;]

bob.readings                      # =&amp;gt; [&amp;lt;Reading 1&amp;gt;]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it seems as though if I wanted to list the number of unread messages sitting in a mailbox (for example Inbox (39) ), I should be able to do something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;%= Post.find_unread_by(current-user).count %&amp;gt;

The user can change the populated values, and when they submit the form, I take the values posted to the server and conditionally save them (determined by some business logic).&lt;br&gt;
All but 1 of the text boxes work as intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The odd box out, upon postback, does not contain the updated value that the user typed into the box.&lt;br&gt;

Every other box properly shows their respective user-supplied values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did find a workaround.&lt;br&gt;
My solution was to basically extract the text box's value out of the &lt;code&gt;Request.Form&lt;/code&gt; object:   &lt;code&gt;Request.Form[myTextBox.UniqueID]&lt;/code&gt;, which does contain the user-supplied value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What could be going on, here?&lt;br&gt;
As I mentioned, the other text boxes receive the user-supplied values just fine, and this particular problematic text box doesn't have any logic associated to it -- it just takes the value and saves it.&lt;br&gt;
The main difference between this text box and the others is that this is a multi-line box (for inputting notes), which I believe is rendered as an HTML "textarea" tag instead of an "input" tag in ASP.NET.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always start with a .sql file that is the source of your stored procedure. Put it in version control once you have written your code.

&lt;li&gt;Start with stored procedures in PL/SQL...&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If you think something can't be done using Java Stored procedure, consider Pro*c.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you think you can't achieve something using Pro*C, you might want to rethink what you need to get done.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Plan what I want from the code,
possible object design, whatever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create my first class, add a huge comment to the top outlining
what my "vision" for the class is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outline the basic test scenarios.. These will basically
become the unit tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create my first method.. Also writing a short comment explaining
how it is &lt;em&gt;expected&lt;/em&gt; to work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write an automated test to see if it does what I expect.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I take a hybrid approach to TDD. I don't like to write tests against nothing, so I usually write some of the code first, then put the unit tests in. It's an iterative process, one which you're never really done with. You change the code, you run your tests. If there's any failures, fix and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other sort of testing is integration testing, which comes along later in the process, and might typically be done by a QA testing team. In any case, integration testing addresses the need to test the pieces as a whole. It's the working product you're concerned with testing. This one is more difficult to deal with b/c it usually involves having automated testing tools (like Robot, for ex.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, take a look at a product like CruiseControl.NET to do continuous builds. CC.NET is nice b/c it will run your unit tests with each build, notifying you immediately of any failures.&lt;/p&gt;

If I'm creating some new functionality for the system I'll be looking to initially define the interfaces and then write unit tests for those interfaces. To work out what tests to write consider the API of the interface and the functionality it provides, get out a pen and paper and think for a while about potential error conditions or ways to prove that it is doing the correct job. If this is too difficult then it's likely that your API isn't good enough.
In regards to the tests, see if you can avoid writing "integration" tests that test more than one specific object and keep them as "unit" test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then create a default implementation of your interface (that does nothing, returns rubbish values but doesn't throw exceptions), plug it into the tests to make sure that the tests fail (this tests that your tests work! :) ). Then write in the functionality and re-run the tests.
This mechanism isn't perfect but will cover a lot of simple coding mistakes and provide you with an opportunity to run your new feature without having to plug it into the entire application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this you then need to test it in the main application with the combination of existing features.
This is where testing is more difficult and if possible should be partially outsourced to good QA tester as they'll have the knack of breaking things. Although it helps if you have these skills too.
Getting testing right is a knack that you have to pick up to be honest. My own experience comes from my own naive deployments and the subsequent bugs that were reported by the users when they used it in anger. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first when this happened to me I found it irritating that the user was intentionally trying to break my software and I wanted to mark all the "bugs" down as "training issues". However after reflecting on it I realised that it is our role (as developers) to make the application as simple and reliable to use as possible even by idiots. It is our role to empower idiots and thats why we get paid the dollar. Idiot handling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To effectively test like this you have to get into the mindset of trying to break everything. Assume the mantle of a user that bashes the buttons and generally attempts to destroy your application in weird and wonderful ways.
Assume that if you don't find flaws then they will be discovered in production to your companies serious loss of face. Take full responsibility for all of these issues and curse yourself when a bug you are responsible (or even part responsible) for is discovered in production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do most of the above then you should start to produce much more robust code, however it is a bit of an art form and requires a lot of experience to be good at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that you can acquire just CALs for your users without having to buy Visual Studio for them (I presume for less than a full blown Visual Studio would cost). At that point, you can just distribute to them the Team Explorer, which is a VS shell with nothing but TFS access components. That is available in your TFS server media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one hand are those wordy documents which given to a programmer are likely to cause him/her missing a few things. I personally dread the word documents spec...I think its because of my reading style...I am always speed reading things which I think will cause me to miss out on key points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I have seen this innovative specs written in Excel by one of our clients. The way he used to write the spec was kind of create a mock application in Excel and use some VBA to mock it. He would do things like on button click where should the form go or what action should it perform (in comments). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On data form, he would display a form in cells and on each data entry cell he would comment on what valid values are, what validation should it perform etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that using this technique, it was less likely to miss out on things that needed to be done. Also, it was much easier to unit test it for the developer. The tester too had a better understanding of the system as it 'performed' before actually being written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visio is another tool to do screen design but I still think Excel has a better edge over it considering its VBA support and its functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you think this should become a more popular way of writing spec? I know it involves a bit of extra work on part of project manager(or whoever is writing the spec) but the payoff is huge...I myself could see a lot of productivity gain from using it. And if there are any better formats of specs that would actually help programmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Architect your application so it doesn't care if the back button is pushed.. It will just deal with it.. This may mean a little extra work from a development point of view, but overall will make the application a lot more robust..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I.e if step 3 performs some data chages, then the user clicks back (to step 2) and clicks next again, then the application checks to see if the changes have been made.. Or ideally, it doesnt make any &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; changes until the user clicks "OK" at the end..

&lt;p&gt;IMHO, yes, absolutely. Take the Microsoft PL license as an example. It's completely redundant. Still, I like that one a lot because it's very clearly worded, much shorter than most other licenses and provides a good amount of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, crafting a new license is fraught with risks because until it has proven its worth before an actual court it isn't worth the paper it is written on (if any).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMHO, there are very few licenses that are worth knowing and using, among them GPL (which I personally don't like), LGPL, BSD and Ms-PL, and of course the Creative Commons licenses but these aren't suitable for software.&lt;/p&gt;

It uses "MTV" for Model, Template and View (and can mention also a URL Dispatcher somewhere along the way), whereas a more standard set of terms is "MVC" for Model, View and Controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Model is the same in both meanings - a model of a data entity, often linked to a database table, if the framework implements Object/Relational Mapping (which Django does).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the two remaining terms might be confusing; where Django talks about Views, the 'rest of the world' talks about Controllers. The basic idea is that this is where the presentation logic is done. Calculations are calculated, arrays are sorted, data is retrieved, etc. I'd say that Django's URL dispatcher is also a part of the conventional Controller concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Django's Templates are comparable to Views elsewhere - here you have your presentation, nothing else. Where Django forces you to a very small set of logical commands, other frameworks often just recommend you not to do anything than present HTML, with some presentation logical elements (like loops, branches, etc), but don't stop you from doing other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to recap:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model:&lt;/strong&gt; Data objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controller (View in Django):&lt;/strong&gt; Data process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;View (Template in Django):&lt;/strong&gt; Presentation&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Having your own license (usually a
  variant on one of the existing ones)
  allows you full control over it. I
  suspect that things like the huge
  change between GPL2 and GPL3
  (especially if you deal with web
  services) make people leery of
  licensing with an agreement outside of
  one's control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is true to some extent.  However, when you license under the GPL, you have the option to say, "Version 2", "Version 2 or later".  If you're leary about how the license may change in the future, you are free to just say it is licensed under that specific version.  &lt;/p&gt;

I "care about" dimension 0 only, and "don't care" about the rest (dim 1).
Summing this array with the above specifications will
"collapse" the "stacks" of dimension 1 down to a single 4 x 1 array:

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 
|_ 1 _|_ 3 _|_ 2 _|_ 8 _|

This can then be summed, or have any operation performed.

&lt;li&gt;Sorry for rolling back the edits, I was hoping when I clicked roll-back it would show me the changes so I could see what I messed up, a bit like wikipedia.  This wasn't the case, as I found out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@jeff - What doesnt make sense?  I am using this great service for (what I think is) a legit reason.  I want to get better at my hobby, which is all it is, as I am in high school.  Many of my posts regard implementing a genetic algorithm (This post, sparsearray, rank an array, pointer manipulation).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am using a sparse array representation, as it is possible to exceed the number of molecules in the universe using a traditional (dense) array.  For now, the implementation of the sparsearray itself doesnt matter a whole lot, as I am working to make it work with a standard array before going to a sparse representation.  For those who havent seen my previous questions, I am using a binary search tree as the structure to contain the sparse array points, and a "driver" function to traverse the tree as necessary, returning whatever the function is designed to do.  This is flexible, so I can accomodate a lot of different methods of accessing the array. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The structure is a hypercube, and the number of dimensions is specified at run time, as well as the length of each dimension (which are all the same, as it is a hypercube).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks everyone for your imput.&lt;/p&gt;

The device happens to implement the HID-device profile, such that it's compatible with Microsoft's HID class driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other application installed on the system is opening the device in read/write mode with no share mode. Which prevents my library (and anything that consumes it) from working with the device. I suppose that's the rub with being an HID-compatible device -- other driver software (mice, controllers, PHIDGETS, etc) can be uncooperative. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the device file path is of the form: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
1: "\\?\hid#hpqremhiddevice&amp;col01#5&amp;21ff20e7&amp;0&amp;0000#{4d1e55b2-f16f-11cf-88cb-001111000030}".

2: "\\?\hid#vid_045e&amp;pid_0023#7&amp;34aa9ece&amp;0&amp;0000#{4d1e55b2-f16f-11cf-88cb-001111000030}".

3: "\?\hid#vid_056a&amp;pid_00b0&amp;col01#6&amp;5b05f29&amp;0&amp;0000#{4d1e55b2-f16f-11cf-88cb-001111000030}".
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I'm trying to open it using code, like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;//  First, open it with minimum permissions, this device may not be ours.
//  we'll re-open it later in read/write
hid_device_ref = CreateFile(
    device_path, GENERIC_READ,
    0, NULL, OPEN_EXISTING,
    FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've considered a tool like FileMon or Process Monitor from SysInternals. But I can't seem to get it to report usage on device file handles like the one listed above.&lt;/p&gt;

You can, however, write "javascript:myFunction(this)" in your address bar, and that function is run.

I would also argue that it should not be used in the href attribute of an anchor.  If a browser supports javascript, it will use the properly defined event handler.  If a browser does not, a javascript: link will appear broken.  IMO, it is better to point them to a page explaining that they need to enable javascript to use that functionality, or better yet a non-javascript required version of the functionality.  So, something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var b=document.body;
if(b&amp;amp;&amp;amp;!document.xmlVersion){
  void(z=document.createElement('script'));
  void(z.src='http://www.google.com/reader/ui/subscribe-bookmarklet.js');
  void(b.appendChild(z));
}else{
  location='http://www.google.com/reader/view/feed/'+encodeURIComponent(location.href)
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To have a user easily add this Bookmarklet, you would format it like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a href="javascript:var%20b=document.body;if(b&amp;amp;&amp;amp;!document.xmlVersion){void(z=document.createElement('script'));void(z.src='http://www.google.com/reader/ui/subscribe-bookmarklet.js');void(b.appendChild(z));}else{location='http://www.google.com/reader/view/feed/'+encodeURIComponent(location.href)}"&amp;gt;Drag this to your bookmarks, or right click and bookmark it!&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually think this is an interesting question. I'm not sure how useful it is, but it is a valid question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Ed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you provide a little more info on this question? You said the dimension of the array is dynamic, but is the number of elements dynamic as well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I'm going to try and answer the question anyways. I can't give you the code off the top of my head (it would take a while to get it right without any compiler here on this PC), but I can point you in the right direction ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's use 8 dimensions (0-7) with indexes 0 to 3 as an example. You care about only 1,2 and 6. This means you have two arrays. First, &lt;code&gt;array_care[4][4][4]&lt;/code&gt; for 1,2, and 6. The &lt;code&gt;array_care[4][4][4]&lt;/code&gt; will hold the end result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we want to iterate in a very specific way. We have the array &lt;code&gt;input[4][4][4][4][4][4][4][4]&lt;/code&gt; to parse through, and we care about dimensions 1, 2, and 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to define some temporary indexes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int dim[8] = {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also need to store the order in which we want to increase the indexes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int increase_index_order[8] = {7,5,4,3,0,6,2,1};
int i = 0;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This order is important for doing what you requested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Define a termination flag:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;bool terminate=false;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we can create our loop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;while (terminate)
{
array_care[dim[1]][dim[2]][dim[6]] += input[dim[0]][dim[1]][dim[2]][dim[3]][dim[4]][dim[5]][dim[6]][dim[7]];

while ((dim[increase_index_order[i]] = 3) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (i &amp;lt; 8))
{
dim[increase_index_order[i]]=0;
i++;
}

if (i &amp;lt; 8) {
dim[increase_index_order[i]]++; i=0;
} else {
terminate=true;
}
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That should work for 8 dimensions, caring about 3 dimensions. It would take a bit more time to make it dynamic, and I don't have the time. Hope this helps. I apologize, but I haven't learned the code markups yet. :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking the most efficient would be the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find lowest prime number that divides cleanly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check if result of division is prime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If not, find next lowest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to 2.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm basing this assumption on it being easier to calculate the small prime factors. Is this about right? What other approaches should I look into?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I've now realised that my approach is futile if there are more than 2 prime factors in play, since step 2 fails when the result is a product of two other primes, therefore a recursive algorithm is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit again: And now I've realised that this does still work, because the last found prime number has to be the highest one, therefore any further testing of the non-prime result from step 2 would result in a smaller prime.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;the neurotic paranoid in me began to wonder how close of an eye they were putting on my code. Especially after a few times where I noticed bugs right before I checked in the supposedly reviewed code.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;So I came up the concept of Jester bugs. Jester is a unit test tester for Java. It works by making a syntactically correct change to the original source code under test, compiling it, and then running the unit test suite. If the unit test suite results in everything being A-okay, then you know that the test suite is flawed because it missed the monkey wrench that was thrown into the code.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;Jester bugs are bugs that you intentionally introduce into your code, to see if your code reviewer is really spotting bugs in your code or just giving it a pass.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As a consequence, a purely functional program always yields the same value for an input, and the order of evaluation is not well-defined;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, functional code is generally easier to parallelize.  Since there are (generally) no side effects of the functions, and they (generally) just act on their arguments, a lot of concurrency issues go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functional programming is also used when you need to be capable of &lt;em&gt;proving&lt;/em&gt; your code is correct.  This is much harder to do with procedural programming (not easy with functional, but still easier).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most modern source control systems require some knowledge of the above topics and should help facilitate you learning them.

&lt;p&gt;The first style would plan everything in to steps, and solves the problem by implementing one step (a procedure) at a time. On the other hand, functional programming would emphasize the divide-and-conquer approach, where the problem is divided into sub-problem, then each sub-problem is solved (creating a function to solve that sub problem) and the results are combined to create the answer for the whole problem. Lastly, Objective programming would mimic the real world by create a mini-world inside the computer with many objects, each of which has a (somewhat) unique characteristics, and interacts with others. From those interactions the result would emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each style of programming has its own advantages and weaknesses. Hence, doing something such as "pure programming" (i.e. purely procedural - no one does this, by the way, which is kind of weird - or purely functional or purely objective) is very difficult, if not impossible, except some elementary problems specially designed to demonstrate the advantage of a programming style (hence, we call those who like pureness "weenie" :D).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, from those styles, we have programming languages that is designed to optimized for some each style. For example, Assembly is all about procedural. Okay, most early languages are procedural, not only Asm, like C, Pascal, (and Fortran, I heard). Then, we have all famous Java in objective school (Actually, Java and C# is also in a class called "money-oriented," but that is subject for another discussion). Also objective is Smalltalk. In functional school, we would have "nearly functional" (some considered them to be impure) Lisp family and  ML family and many "purely functional" Haskell, Erlang, etc. By the way, there are many general languages such as Perl, Python, Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;John:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; your solution looks like a lot of engineering :P What I ended up using is following wrapper:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;package com.sun.lwuit;

public class ImageWrapper {
  private final Image image;

  public ImageWrapper(final Image lwuitBuffer) {
    this.image = lwuitBuffer;

  public javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics getGraphics() {
    return image.getGraphics().getGraphics();
  }
}

&lt;p&gt;Now I can get the 'native' Graphics element from LWUIT. Paint on it - effectively painting on LWUIT image. And I can use the image to paint on a component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it still looks like a hack :)&lt;/p&gt;

Its going to web-based and hosted on our servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm using a simple Allow or Deny option for each 'Resource' or screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option A&lt;/strong&gt;
The presence of an entry in the access table means access is allowed.  This will not need a column in the database to store information.  If no results are returned, then access is denied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this will mean a smaller table, but would queries search the whole table to determine there is no match?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option B&lt;/strong&gt;
A bit column is included in the database that controls the Allow/Deny.  This will mean there is always a result to be found, and makes for a larger table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I think this is true to some extent. However, when you license under the GPL, you have the option to say, "Version 2", "Version 2 or later". If you're leary about how the license may change in the future, you are free to just say it is licensed under that specific version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That opens up a different can of worms, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you released under GPL2 &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; and GPL3 comes out and you &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; the changes it makes, you're theoretically going to have to go around to all your contributors and get their unanimous approval to change the license their code is released under.  All it takes is one of them to say "nope, I only licensed my contributions under GPL2 and refuse to permit GPL3" - or they can just not reply - to derail your proposed license change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at the things that are important: your project, your code, your job, your personal life. None of them are going to have their success rest on whether or not you use the "this" keyword to qualify access to fields. The this keyword will not help you ship on time. It's not going to reduce bugs, it's not going to have any appreciable effect on code quality or maintainability. It's not going to get you a raise, or allow you to spend less time at the office. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's really just a style issue. If you like "this", then use it. If you don't, then don't. If you need it to get correct semantics then use it. The truth is, every programmer has his own unique programing style. That style reflects that particular programmer's notions of what the "most aesthetically pleasing code" should look like. By definition, any other programmer who reads your code is going to have a different programing style. That means there is always going to be something you did that the other guy doesn't like, or would have done differently. At some point some guy is going to read your code and grumble about something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't fret over it. I would just make sure the code is as aesthetically pleasing as possible according to your own tastes. If you ask 10 programmers how to format code, you are going to get about 15 different opinions. A better thing to focus on is how the code is factored. Are things abstracted right? Did I pick meaningful names for things? Is there a lot of code duplication? Are there ways I can simplify stuff? Getting those things right, I think, will have the greatest positive impact on your project, your code, your job, and your life. Coincidentally, it will probably also cause the other guy to grumble the least. If your code works, is easy to read, and is well factored, the other guy isn't going to be scrutinizing how you initialize fields. He's just going to use your code, marvel at it's greatness, and then move on to something else.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm using the FLVPlayback component to control the video inside of my program. While running memory checks using System.totalMemory I've noticed that whenever a video is loaded, it will eat up a chunk of memory and even when I remove all the event listeners from it(they are all weakly referenced), remove the component from its parent, stop the video and null the component instance, it still will not give that memory back.&lt;/p&gt;

Currently every video is loaded into a new FLVPlayback instance whenever it is required, but I have read that perhaps the best way to go about this problem is to simply have a global FLVPlayback instance and just reload the new video into the old instance, that way there would only be one FLVPlayback component in the application's memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;else if &lt;code&gt;foo.activated &amp;amp;&amp;amp; foo.endDate &amp;lt;= now&lt;/code&gt;, call &lt;code&gt;doEnd(foo)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(*) "in" means the unique identifier matches, not necessarily the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current (legacy) code does many comparisons to figure out &lt;code&gt;removeSet&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;addSet&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;updateSet&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;startSet&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;endSet&lt;/code&gt;, and then loop to act on each item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code is quite messy (partly because I have left out some spaghetti logic already) and I am trying to refactor it.  Some more background info:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As far as I know, the &lt;code&gt;oldSet&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;newSet&lt;/code&gt; are actually backed by &lt;code&gt;ArrayList&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each set contains less than 100 items, most likely max out at 20&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This code is called frequently (measured in millions/day), although the sets seldom differ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I convert &lt;code&gt;oldSet&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;newSet&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;HashMap&amp;lt;Foo&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (order is not of concern here), with the IDs as keys, would it made the code easier to read and easier to compare?  How much of time &amp;amp; memory performance is loss on the conversion?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would iterating the two sets and perform the appropriate operation be more efficient and concise?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for what you should learn, that depends on what you're interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you looking to challenge yourself while staying in the same medium (web-centric applications)? I would suggest learning about Apache and the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) architecture and challenge yourself to build a web application that you could readily build with ASP .NET using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to learn something completely different? Try &lt;a href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Prolog&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/lispbox/" rel="nofollow"&gt;LISP&lt;/a&gt; and see what you can do with those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you'd like to get into embedded software? Learn C to start.&lt;/p&gt;

If there was a project with their own license and I was going to release a bunch of code to it, it stated that it was licensed under XYX version N, or any future version, then what's to say that the people controlling that license won't do a complete 180 on a future version, and make it completely closed source?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the record, the current release of nUnit 2.5 Alpha &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; seem to contain templates for test projects in Visual Studio 2008. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I followed the directions &lt;a href="http://vishaljoshi.blogspot.com/2008/02/aspnet-mvc-test-framework-integration.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; which describe how to create your own project templates and then add appropriate registry entries that allow your templates to appear in the drop-down box in the &lt;em&gt;Create Unit Test Project&lt;/em&gt; dialog box of an MVC project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a high level, what you have to do is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Export it as a template (which results in a single ZIP archive)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy it from the local user's template folder to the Visual Studio main template test folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute &lt;strong&gt;devenv.exe /setup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;strong&gt;regedit&lt;/strong&gt; and create a few registry entries.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much for the testing framework selection being easy!  Although, to be fair MVC is not even beta yet.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all that, I did get the framework of choice (NUnit) to show up in the drop down box.  However, there was still a bit left to be desired:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although the test project gets properly created, it did not automatically have a project reference to the main MVC project.  When using  &lt;em&gt;Visual Studio Unit Test&lt;/em&gt; as the test project, it automatically does this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I tried to open the ZIP file produced and edit the MyTemplate.vssettings file as well as the .csproj project file in order to correct the aforementioned issue as well as tweak the names of things so they'd appear more user friendly.  This for some reason does not work.  The ZIP file produced can not be updated via WinZip or Win-Rar -- each indicates the archive is corrupt.  Each can extract the contents, though.  So, I tried updating the extracted files and then recreating the ZIP file.  Visual Studio did not like it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I should probably read &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/s365byhx.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; as well which discusses making project templates for Visual Studio (also referenced in the blog post I linked to above.)  I admit to being disappointed though; from all the talk about MVC playing well with other testing frameworks, etc, I thought that it'd be easier to register a 3rd party framework.&lt;/p&gt;

If you feel like getting fancier, say some domain had many subdomains, you could instead make a field into which the reversed domain went, so you'd store com.gmail, com.company.department, or ae.eim so you could find all the United Arab Emirates related addresses with a prefix query of 'ae.'&lt;/p&gt;

If you become very good in many skills then you may never become truly excellent in one.  I know because I have taken this route myself and have found it difficult to get employment at times. After all, who wants someone who is capable at many languages when there is someone who excels at the specific thing they need.  If a company develops in C# then who would want someone who is OK at C# but also is good at C, Visual Basic, Perl and Cobol, when all they really want is the best possible C# developer for the money they can afford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, you will only ever be employed for one, maybe two of your skills. There are very few jobs for people who are good in 10 or 15 skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to a new skill then maybe check out the job boards and find which skills are particularly in need, but be aware that what is the flavour of the month this year may not even be on the scene next year, which will make all of that effort to learn the skill futile and wasted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I would say is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do one thing, and do it well.  This may include supporting skills (C#, ASP.Net, SQL, LINQ etc).  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to choose something else, then choose something complementary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possibly most importantly, choose something you will enjoy.  Maybe Ruby on Rails is the current flavour of the month, but if you don't enjoy doing it, then don't do it.  Really, it's not worth it.  You will never wish, on your death bed, that you had worked more in something you didn't enjoy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another direction you could look at is maybe not for a particular development skill, but look for something else, maybe soft skills like people management, better business understanding or even look to something like literary skills to help improve your communications skills.  All of these will help to allow you to do what you want to do more, and cut down on the stuff you really don't enjoy, thus helping to make your job more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apologies for the waffling here.  Hope you are still awake :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;ct=res&amp;amp;cd=3&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cgisecurity.com%2Fdatabase%2Foracle%2Fpdf%2FCWP_9IVSDB_SECURITY.PDF&amp;amp;ei=RSuvSLSRDI6usAPE-Yht&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFNFGPT9WjTOibt5AmK7oQwTIq_Cg&amp;amp;sig2=34iBQyH401KRnKGQ8sSlKg" rel="nofollow"&gt;Technical comparisons of Oracle and DB/2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a document written from the opposite point of view - Someone moving from Oracle to DB2.  I still find it's useful information:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/db2/library/techarticle/dm-0401gupta/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Leverage your Oracle 10g skills to learn DB2...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And another IBM link that has some really great information all around:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/search/searchResults.jsp?searchType=1&amp;amp;pageLang=&amp;amp;displaySearchScope=dW&amp;amp;searchSite=dW&amp;amp;lastUserQuery1=oracle+db2+differences&amp;amp;lastUserQuery2=&amp;amp;lastUserQuery3=&amp;amp;lastUserQuery4=&amp;amp;qa=oracle%2520db2%2520differences&amp;amp;query=oracle+db2+&amp;amp;searchScope=dW&amp;amp;Go.x=0&amp;amp;Go.y=0" rel="nofollow"&gt;IBM Developer Network Search Results&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Yes, I know propagandaish is not a real word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just did this in lukeall on my index and it worked, therefore it should work in Solr which uses the standard query parser. I don't actually use Solr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In base Lucene there's a fine reason for why you'd never query for every document, it's because to query for a document you must use a &lt;code&gt;new indexReader("DirectoryName")&lt;/code&gt; and apply a query to it. Therefore you could totally skip applying a query to it and use the &lt;code&gt;indexReader&lt;/code&gt; methods &lt;code&gt;numDocs()&lt;/code&gt; to get a count of all the documents, and &lt;code&gt;document(int n)&lt;/code&gt; to retrieve any of the documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic idea is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a hash is a good way to store a password
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you take the user's entered password and hash it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compare it to the stored hash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the hash is the same, the passwords match&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there's a problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppose you pick the password "jeff" and I also pick the password "jeff".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now both of our password hashes are the same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So if I see the stored hash codes, I will know your password is the same as mine, "jeff".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we can add a "salt" string to the password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This can be any random thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppose for your account it is "zuzu" and for my account it is "rjrj".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now we hash the string "jeffzuzu" for your password, and "jeffrjrj" for my password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now we have different hash values for our password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can safely store the salt value with the hashed password, since even knowing the salt value won't help to decode the hash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You mention .net, there's a pointer over in another forum to this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;System.Security.Cryptography.MD5CryptoServiceProvider md5 = new
System.Security.Cryptography.MD5CryptoServiceProvider();

string hash =BitConverter.ToString((md5.ComputeHash(
System.Text.ASCIIEncoding.Default.GetBytes(stringtohash) ) ));

Usage:
iisreset [computername]

    /RESTART            Stop and then restart all Internet services.
    /START              Start all Internet services.
    /STOP               Stop all Internet services.
    /REBOOT             Reboot the computer.
    /REBOOTONERROR      Reboot the computer if an error occurs when starting,
                        stopping, or restarting Internet services.

                        attempting to stop them gracefully fails.
    /TIMEOUT:val        Specify the timeout value ( in seconds ) to wait for
                        a successful stop of Internet services. On expiration
                        of this timeout the computer can be rebooted if

&lt;p&gt;However, I have never come across a solution that searched for content within audio files. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For example:&lt;/strong&gt; Let us assume that I have about 200 podcasts downloaded to my PC in the form of mp3, wav and ogg files. They are all named generically say podcast1.mp3, podcast2.mp3, etc. So, it is not possible to know what the content is, without actually hearing them. Lets say that, I am interested in finding out, which the podcasts talk about 'game programming'. I want the results to be shown as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Podcast1.mp3 - 3 result(s) at time index(es) - 0:16:21, 0:43:45, 1:12:31&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Podcast21.ogg - 1 result(s) at time index(es) - 0:12:01&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So my questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How could one approach this problem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there are suitable algorithms developed to do something like this? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Loading assemblies from GAC mean less overhead and security that your application will always load correct version of .NET library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You shouldn't ngen assemblies that are outside of GAC, because there will be almost no performance gain, in many cases even loss in performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You're already using GAC, because all standard .NET assemblies are actually in GAC and ngened (during installation).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using GAC for your own libraries adds complexity into deployment, I would try to avoid it at all costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your users need to be logged as administrators during installation if you want to put something into GAC, quite a problem for many types of applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to sum it all, start simple and if you later see major performance gains if you put your assemblies into GAC and NGEN them, go for it, otherwise don't bother. GAC is more suitable for frameworks where there is expectation for library to be shared among more applications, in 99% of cases, you don't need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the problem here is that you are misunderstanding the fundamental value add of a code review.  The point of code reviews is not specifically to find bugs.  You should have other processes in place such as unit testing, integration testing, continuous integration builds, QA tools/teams, etc to find bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code reviews provide value by identifying issues at different levels -- obviously you CAN identify specific bugs during code reviews, and that's great, but a code review can also help identify problems at a higher or lower level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, at a slightly higher level someone may be able to point out that there is a requirement that all currency must be stored as cents in integers rather than as dollars in floating point and that the code under review fails to meet that requirement (while otherwise being perfectly correct).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a a lower level, it gives more experienced developers an opportunity to give the more junior developers advice on how they could have solved problems better/more simply/etc.  For example, perhaps the developer has a lot of nested for loops that could be replaced with some simple list comprehensions or higher order functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise it might also give a younger more energetic developer a chance to let an older more experienced, but also more set-in-his-ways developer know about some new cutting edge technology that would simplified their code drastically, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day it also serves to just keep everyone up to date on what is going on in the code base, catch any egregious departures from what is expected, make sure everyone is on the right track, marching in the same direction, and to help the developers involved grow and evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, say you have a partial trust ASP.NET application which needs to perform a task that would require elevated privileges, i.e. &lt;em&gt;Full Trust&lt;/em&gt;. The solution is to put the code that requires elevated privileges into a separate assembly. The assembly is marked with the &lt;code&gt;AllowPartiallyTrustedCallers&lt;/code&gt; attribute and the class that contains the privileged logic is marked with the PermissionSet attribute, something like this: &lt;/p&gt;

If you're creating versioned web services (with more than 1 version of the implemented interfaces) then you often have a single version of your apps business objects with more than 1 version of the data contract/message contract objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, in complex Enterprise Integration situations you often have a canonical data format (Data and Message contracts) which is shared by a number of applications, which forces each application to map the canonical data format to its internal object model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want a tool to help with the nitty gritty of separating data contract/message contract etc. then check out Microsoft's Web Services Software Factory &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc487895.aspx"&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc487895.aspx&lt;/a&gt; which has some good recipes for solving the WCF plumbing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In regards to excpetions, WCF automatically wraps all exceptions in FaultExceptions, which are serialized as wire-format faults. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's also possible to throw generic Fault Exceptions which allows you to specify additional details to be included with the serialized fault. Since the faults thrown by a web service operation are part of its contract it's a good idea to declare the faults on the operation declaration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[FaultContract(typeof(AuthenticationFault))]
[FaultContract(typeof(AuthorizationFault))]
StoreLocationResponse StoreLocation(StoreLocationRequest request);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the AuthenticationFault and AuthorizationFault types represent the additional details to be serialized and sent over the wire and can be thrown as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;throw new FaultException&amp;lt;AuthenticationFault&amp;gt;(new AuthenticationFault());

Anyway the design I've come up with so far looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can't possibly store all the instances of a recurring event, at least not before they occur, so I simply have one table that stores the first instance of the event as an actual date, an optional expiration, and nullable repeat_unit and repeat_increment fields to describe the repetition. For single instances the repition fields are null, otherwise the units will be 'day', 'week', 'month', 'year' and increment is simply the multiple of units to add to start date for the next occurrence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storing past events only seems advantageous if you need to establish relationships with other entities in your model, and even then it's not necessary to have an explicit "event instance" table in every case. If the other entities already have date/time "instance" data then a foreign key to the event (or join table for a many-to-many) would most likely be sufficient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To do "change this instance"/"change all future instances", I was planning on just duplicating the events and expiring the stale ones. So to change a single instances, you'd expire the old one at it's last occurrence, make a copy for the new, unique occurrence with the changes and without any repetition, and another copy of the original at the following occurrence that repeats into the future. Changing all future instances is similar, you would just expire the original and make a new copy with the changes and repition details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two problems I see with this design so far are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It makes MWF-type events hard to represent. It's possible, but forces the user to create three separate events that repeat weekly on M,W,F individually, and any changes they want to make will have to be done on each one separately as well. These kind of events aren't particularly useful in my app, but it does leave a wart on the model that makes it less universal than I'd like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By copying the events to make changes, you break the association between them, which could be useful in some scenarios (or, maybe it would just be occasionally problematic.) The event table could theoretically contain a "copied_from" id field to track where an event originated, but I haven't fully thought through how useful something like that would be. For one thing, parent/child hierarchical relationships are a pain to query from SQL, so the benefits would need to be pretty heavy to outweigh the cost for querying that data. You could use a &lt;a href="http://mikehillyer.com/articles/managing-hierarchical-data-in-mysql/" rel="nofollow"&gt;nested-set&lt;/a&gt; instead, I suppose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly I think it's &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; to compute events for a given timespan using straight SQL, but I haven't worked out the exact details and I think the queries usually end up being too cumbersome to be worthwhile. However for the sake of argument, you can use the following expression to compute the difference in months between the given month and year an event:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(:month + (:year * 12)) - (MONTH(occursOn) + (YEAR(occursOn) * 12))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on the last example, you could use MOD to determine whether difference in months is the correct multiple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;MOD(:month + (:year * 12)) - (MONTH(occursOn) + (YEAR(occursOn) * 12), repeatIncrement) = 0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway this isn't perfect (it doesn't ignore expired events, doesn't factor in start / end times for the event, etc), so it's only meant as a motivating example. Generally speaking though I think most queries will end up being too complicated. You're probably better off querying for events that occur during a given range, or don't expire before the range, and computing the instances themselves in code rather than SQL. If you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want the database to do the processing then a stored procedure would probably make your life a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if what you want is to be able to create "in application" dashboards, where "you" design the reports and have limited parameters you expose to the user, then I suggest looking into "control" based charting vendors like &lt;a href="http://www.steema.com/"&gt;TeeChart&lt;/a&gt; . &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros/cons of each strategy:
Crystal/Microsoft Reporting services will give you out of the box handling of things like report scheduling, export to excel and pdf, and separation between application and report design. 
The independent charting tools you can get give you better control, they render better on any size you need, easier to grammatically manipulate and can handle eye candy such as flash based (no flash charts in MS SSRS)&lt;/p&gt;

there's &lt;a href="http://www.alk.com/pcmiler/pcmiler-system-req.asp"&gt;PC Miler&lt;/a&gt; which is used
by many trucking companies to
calculate shipping rates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make calls to the Google Maps (or other) api. If you need to do many requests per day, consider caching the results on the server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also &lt;strong&gt;very important&lt;/strong&gt; is to consider building an equivalence database for cities, suburbs, towns etc. if you think you'll ever need to group your data. This gets really complicated though, and you may not find a one-size-fits-all solution for your problem.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option is to proxy pass one server to the other. With Apache, you could do something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;NameVirtualHost *

Some web servers (apache does with &lt;a href="http://stderr.net/apache/rpaf/"&gt;mod_rpaf&lt;/a&gt;) can substitute the X-Forwarded-For header in place of the wrong IP address.

&lt;p&gt;For example, I am working on a (non-OOP) &lt;a href="http://www.seqan.de/" rel="nofollow"&gt;framework&lt;/a&gt; where the find algorithm is different depending both on the type of the needle and the haystack. Apart from the fact that this would require double-dispatch in an object-oriented environment, it also means that it isn't meaningful to write either &lt;code&gt;needle.find(haystack)&lt;/code&gt; or to write &lt;code&gt;haystack.find(needle)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, your application could happily delegate finding to either of both classes, or stick with one algorithm altogether in which case the decision is arbitrary. In that case, I would prefer the &lt;code&gt;haystack.find(needle)&lt;/code&gt; way because it seems more logical to apply the finding to the haystack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could insert a record each time one of the above actions is done on a specific table into a logging table that keeps track of the action, what db user did it, timestamp, table it was preformed on, and previous value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is probably a better answer though as this would require you to cache the value before the actual delete or update was preformed I think. But you could use this to do rollbacks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it's a great example of C++ shouting "in your face!" to OOP.  The idea is that OOP is not a silver bullet of any kind;  sometimes things are best described in terms of actions, sometimes in terms of objects, sometimes neither and sometimes both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bjarne Stroustrup said in TC++PL that when you design a system you should strive to reflect reality under the constraints of effective and efficient code.  For me, this means you should never follow anything blindly.  Think about the things at hand (haystack, needle) and the context we're in (searching, that's what the expression is about).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the emphasis is about the searching, then using an algorithm (action) that emphasizes searching (i.e. is flexibly to fit haystacks, oceans, deserts, linked lists).  If the emphasis is about the haystack, encapsulate the find method inside the haystack object, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, sometimes you're in doubt and have hard times making a choice.  In this case, be object oriented.  If you change your mind later, I think it is easier to extract an action from an object then to split an action to objects and classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow these guidelines, and your code will be clearer and, well, more beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's primarily used for importing ruby on rails plugins, but I don't see why it shouldn't work for any subversion repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically what it does is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;svn export latest revision of the remote path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commit these files into your local svn as if they were local files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;attach metadata in the form of svn properties about the remote path and revision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means you can keep a reference to a particular version of a remote repo without having to have it constantly updated like with an svn external.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if you want to update your local copy of the library to the latest remote version, you just do &lt;code&gt;piston update&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also be able to look at the history of updates, by simply looking at the metadata - svn properties are versioned just like files and everything else&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you don't care about the searcher's properties (e.g. searcher strength, vision, etc.), then I would say haystack.find(needle) would be the cleanest solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, if you do care about the searcher's properties (or any other properties for that matter), I would inject an ISearcher interface into either the haystack constructor or the function to facilitate that.  This supports both object oriented design (a haystack has needles) and inversion of control / dependency injection (makes it easier to unit test the "find" function).&lt;/p&gt;

The more I work on immensely complex systems, the more I see the need to truly decouple objects.  He's right.

However, I would take into consideration that stuff does get lost in a haystack, but I know nothing about what exactly that stuff.  I think it's better to not make the haystack look for items in itself (how &lt;em&gt;smart&lt;/em&gt; is a haystack anyway).  The right approach to me is to have the haystack present a collection of things that are in it, but are not straw or hay or whatever gives a haystack its essence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the activity date is meant to indicate the local time zone, but not a specific one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay - back to the drawing board. Try this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;where t.TheDateINeedToCheck BETWEEN (
    dateadd(hh, (tz.Offset + ISNULL(ds.LocalTimeZone, 0)) * -1, @ActivityDate)
    AND
    dateadd(hh, (tz.Offset + ISNULL(ds.LocalTimeZone, 0)) * -1, (@ActivityDate + 1))
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which will translate the @ActivityDate to local time, and compare against that. That's your best chance for using an index, though I'm not sure it'll work - you should try it and check the query plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next option would be an indexed view, with an indexed, computed TimeINeedToCheck &lt;em&gt;in local time&lt;/em&gt;. Then you just go back to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;where v.TheLocalDateINeedToCheck BETWEEN @ActivityDate AND (@ActivityDate + 1)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which would definitely use the index - though you have a slight overhead on INSERT and UPDATE then.&lt;/p&gt;

But what do you mean by web-server functionality - is that the UI that get served up to the users in form of a HTML page? Or is it something more, like a server capturing the video stream and transcoding it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the direction you need to take is to first find the URL end-point of your video stream. Since it's a network camera I assume the camera has a built in IP-stack/HTTP server serving up the video stream. Once you have that feed you probably have to transcode it into a video format consumable by Silverlight. There are multiple tools you can use, but for Silverlight the preferred tool Microsoft Expression Encoder. It supports live transcoding of webcam video streams. I think it supports both Direct Show devices as well as video streams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put all class files into a single directory.  Name the file after the class, ie, &lt;code&gt;classes/User.php&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;classes/User.class.php&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kevin's idea of putting models into one directory, controllers into another, etc.  Works well if all of your classes fit nicely into the MVC framework, but sometimes, things get messy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include the directory in the classname.  For example, a class called Model&amp;#95;User would actually be located at &lt;code&gt;classes/Model/User.php&lt;/code&gt;.  Your __autoload function would know to translate an underscore into a directory separator to find the file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just parse the whole directory structure once.  Either in the __autoload function, or even just in the same PHP file where it's defined, loop over the contents of the &lt;code&gt;classes&lt;/code&gt; directory and cache what files are where.  So, if you try to load the &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; class, it doesn't matter if it's in &lt;code&gt;classes/User.php&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;classes/Models/User.php&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;classes/Utility/User.php&lt;/code&gt;.  Once it finds &lt;code&gt;User.php&lt;/code&gt; somewhere in the &lt;code&gt;classes&lt;/code&gt; directory, it will know what file to include when the &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; class needs to be autoloaded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
