There are different types of extensions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vendor extension - only one vendor provides a certain type of functionality.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example: &lt;code&gt;NV_vertex_program&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multivendor extension - multiple vendors have gotten together and agreed on the functionality.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example: &lt;code&gt;EXT_vertex_program&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ARB extension - the OpenGL Architecture Review Board has blessed the extension.  You have a reasonable expectation that this type of extension will be around for a while.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example: &lt;code&gt;ARB_vertex_program&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extensions don't have to go through all of these steps.  Sometimes an extension is only ever implemented by one vendor, before hardware designs go a different way and the extension is abandoned.  Other times, an extension might make it as far as ARB status before everyone decides there's a better way.  (The &lt;code&gt;ARB_vertex_program&lt;/code&gt; approach, for instance, was set aside in favor of the high-level shading language approach of &lt;code&gt;ARB_vertex_shader&lt;/code&gt; when it came time to roll shaders into the core OpenGL spec.)  Even ARB extensions don't last forever; I wouldn't write something today requiring &lt;code&gt;ARB_matrix_palette&lt;/code&gt;, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of that having been said, it's a very good idea to keep up to date on extensions, in particular the latest ARB and EXT extensions.  In the past it has been true that some of the 'fast paths' through the hardware were only accessible via extensions.  Likewise, if you want to know what all functionality a piece of hardware can do, there's no better place to look than in a vendor-specific extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're just getting started in OpenGL, I'd recommend investigating:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ARB_vertex_buffer_object&lt;/code&gt;  (vertices)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ARB_vertex_shader&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;ARB_fragment_shader&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;ARB_shader_objects&lt;/code&gt; / GLSL spec  (shaders)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More advanced:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ARB/EXT_framebuffer_object&lt;/code&gt;  (off-screen rendering)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all functionality that's been rolled into core, but it can be good to see it in isolation so you can get a better feel for where its boundaries lie.  (The core OpenGL spec seamlessly mixes the old with the new, so this can be pretty important if you want to stay on the fast path, and avoid the legacy and sometimes implemented in software paths.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever you do, make sure you have appropriate checks for the extensions you decide to use, and fallbacks where necessary.  Even though your card may have a given extension, there's no guarantee that the extension will be present on another vendor's card, or even on another operating system with the same card.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm not looking for a specific fix so much as a quick explanation or link that explains OpenGL rotation more generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;glPushMatrix();
  glRotatef(90.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0);
  glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES);        
    glVertex3f( 1.0, 1.0, 0.0 );

  glEnd();
glPopMatrix();

Hmm thanks to Mike Haboustak - it appeared my code was calling a SetCamera function that use glOrtho.  I'm too new to OpenGL to have any idea of what this meant but disabling this and rotating in the Z-axis produced the desired result.  Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should try rotating around the Z axis instead and see if you get something that makes more sense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenGL has two matrices related to the display of geometry, the ModelView and the Projection.  Both are applied to coordinates before the data becomes visible on the screen. First the ModelView matrix is applied, transforming the data from model space into view space. Then the Projection matrix is applied with transforms the data from view space for "projection" on your 2D monitor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ModelView is used to position multiple objects to their locations in the "world", Projection is used to position the objects onto the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your code seems fine, so I assume from reading the documentation you know what the nature of functions like glPushMatrix() is. If rotating around Z still doesn't make sense, verify that you're editing the ModelView matrix by calling glMatrixMode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Do you participate in code peer reviews or practice pair programming, or both?   &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;What hurdles to implementation did you face?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my own case, our development team pursued peer reviews of a number of different software artifacts (requirements analyses, test plans, code, and so on). Peer programming was not even considered as an option. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peer review practice was pushed down from the top, and the developers never bought into it. We had an external SQA group that gathered metrics from the activities, but the numbers were pretty worthless since the effort was half-hearted. After years of this being the "official" way to do things, the developers have come to collectively ignore the prescribed procedures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now there is less visibility into when bugs are getting interjected into the lifecycle. And not doing the peer reviews has led to increased specialization on the team...where no one really knows the requirements/logic of components outside their own specialized area of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be valuable to know your experiences w/ peer reviews or pair programming, especially success stories.  &lt;/p&gt;

Frankly, I think it is probably overkill as @Mike Deck points out. For such a small set of items to compare and process I think arrays would be a better choice from a procedural standpoint but here is my pseudo-coded (because I'm lazy) solution. I have an assumption that the Foo class is comparable based on it's unique id and not all of the data in it's contents:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Collection&amp;lt;Foo&amp;gt; oldSet = ...;
Collection&amp;lt;Foo&amp;gt; newSet = ...;

private Collection difference(Collection a, Collection b) {
Collection result = a.clone();
result.removeAll(b)
return result;
}

private Collection intersection(Collection a, Collection b) {
Collection result = a.clone();
result.retainAll(b)
return result;
}

public doWork() {
    // if foo is in(*) oldSet but not newSet, call doRemove(foo)
    Collection removed = difference(oldSet, newSet);
    if (!removed.isEmpty()) {
     loop removed {
      Foo foo = removedIter.next();
      doRemove(foo);
     }
    }
//else if foo is not in oldSet but in newSet, call doAdd(foo)
Collection added = difference(newSet, oldSet);
if (!added.isEmpty()) {
 loop added  {
  Foo foo = addedIter.next();
  doAdd(foo);
 }
}

// else if foo is in both collections but modified, call doUpdate(oldFoo, newFoo)
Collection matched = intersection(oldSet, newSet);
Comparator comp = new Comparator() {
 int compare(Object o1, Object o2) {
  Foo f1, f2;
  if (o1 instanceof Foo) f1 = (Foo)o1;
  if (o2 instanceof Foo) f2 = (Foo)o2;
  return f1.activated == f2.activated ? f1.startdate.compareTo(f2.startdate) == 0 ? ... : f1.startdate.compareTo(f2.startdate) : f1.activated ? 1 : 0;
 }

 boolean equals(Object o) {
  // equal to this Comparator..not used
 }
}
loop matched {
 Foo foo = matchedIter.next();
 Foo oldFoo = oldSet.get(foo);
 Foo newFoo = newSet.get(foo);
 if (comp.compareTo(oldFoo, newFoo ) != 0) {
  doUpdate(oldFoo, newFoo);
 } else {
  //else if !foo.activated &amp;amp;&amp;amp; foo.startDate &amp;gt;= now, call doStart(foo)
  if (!foo.activated &amp;amp;&amp;amp; foo.startDate &amp;gt;= now) doStart(foo);

  // else if foo.activated &amp;amp;&amp;amp; foo.endDate &amp;lt;= now, call doEnd(foo)
  if (foo.activated &amp;amp;&amp;amp; foo.endDate &amp;lt;= now) doEnd(foo);
 }
}
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as your questions:
If I convert oldSet and newSet into HashMap (order is not of concern here), with the IDs as keys, would it made the code easier to read and easier to compare? How much of time &amp;amp; memory performance is loss on the conversion?
I think that you would probably make the code more readable by using a Map BUT...you would probably use more memory and time during the conversion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would iterating the two sets and perform the appropriate operation be more efficient and concise?
Yes, this would be the best of both worlds especially if you followed @Mike Sharek 's advice of Rolling your own List with the specialized methods or following something like the Visitor Design pattern to run through your collection and process each item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prefer to have both methods 1 and 2 at hand. Using ruby as an example, it comes with &lt;code&gt;.include?&lt;/code&gt; which is used like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;haystack.include? needle
=&amp;gt; returns true if the haystack includes the needle
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes though, purely for readability reasons, I want to flip it round. Ruby doesn't come with an &lt;code&gt;in?&lt;/code&gt; method, but it's a one-liner, so I often do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;needle.in? haystack
=&amp;gt; exactly the same as above
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it's "more important" to emphasise the haystack, or the operation of searching, I prefer to write &lt;code&gt;include?&lt;/code&gt;.
Often though, neither the haystack or the search is really what you care about, just that the object is present - in this case I find &lt;code&gt;in?&lt;/code&gt; better conveys the meaning of the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read and find numerous articles and books that discuss different ways to approach this within various sized teams, but you seem to inquiring about experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think peer review should be made fun. Food provided and keep the atmosphere jovial. It really should be treated as a time where developers/programmers can learn from each other not a chance to judge (and we all know how every programmed seems born with an innate judgmental gene). I have tended to appreciate or assisted to organize reviews to be 1/3rd or 1/4th of the time as open. By that I mean when the group comes together and one person presents a project they are working or even reviewed which is not even related to the current project (I know this is difficult with deadlines but try for it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creatives usually get together to display paintings, designs, and artists theyre currently into in order to help facilitate inspiration. Realistically, inspiration should be the leading concept you hope to foster in a review. Secondary to that people just naturally notice things their fellow developers do which they have NOT noticed before. Oh wow, so you managed to do that in a single line of code? Cool. Getting developers inspired and motivated about what they do, what they're working on, and how they go about it will pay dividends more out than using peer review to establish pecking order and rank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, comes the actually review part but its an inevitable fact. Your better developers will see poor code and after enough reviews its time for the poor coder to either step-up or forget about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you keep things positive and organized its usually a great experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost forgot to touch on pair programming. This is tougher to set-up. Obviously you can't have two of your weaker programmers working together or you might as well arrange a million monkeys with a million typewriters. Try to put a stronger person with a weaker on and offer incentives to both privately. Someone who is weaker should know that improvement could be rewarded (if they require such incentive) and the stronger programmer should know that real leaders start as good mentors. Make sure the weaker dev is typing though. Not vice-versa or it becomes a presentation and "&lt;em&gt;yawn&lt;/em&gt;" someone might not gain anything by the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

I knew enough to use some form of regex, but not enough about regexs to do the job well.  Several days later I finished the task, but in peer review I was crushed to learn that I could have done better and what I produced was trash.  I learned how to do lexical parsing just to prove that I wasnt an idiot, but lets just say that the peer review process sucked.  I didnt need a senior person to dance on my failures, I needed a mentor and I have reminded myself of that every time I have done a peer review. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like peer reviews when we check the egos at the door. (This includes mine!)  There is a finite amount of time in this world, and only so much that you can learn and do.  Through a good peer review you can expand you knowledge and get more done in a shorter time frame.  The problems arise when the things degrade into over anal syntax checking.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a few rules because of this.  I don't peer review anything that we can automate.  Run a spell check, and code beautifier.  If you have something like FXCop available to you, run it, do what it says, or have a darn good reason why you aren't.  Then we can look at how the code is put together, how it functions and things that we can do to improve upon it.  In this way you get a different perspective on how to solve a problem and why someone thinks that way.  Sometimes the other way is not really better, sometimes the new solution is fantastic and something you will use for the rest of you programming life.
Once the review is done, thats it, Im not using it as an example against you.  Its yours to learn what you will from it.  I will not manage by fear or threat, youre a smart person and Im going to let you show it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;In Ruby, I guess you can't marshal a lambda/proc object, right?  Is
  that possible in lisp or other languages?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;What I was trying to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;l = lamda { ... }
Bj.submit "/path/to/ruby/program", :stdin =&amp;gt; Marshal.dump(l)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So, I'm sending BackgroundJob a lambda object, which contains the
  context/code for what to do.  But, guess that wasn't possible.  I
  ended up marshaling a normal ruby object that contained instructions
  for what to do after the program ran.&lt;/p&gt;

This is called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming" rel="nofollow"&gt;dynamic programming&lt;/a&gt;. It is usually a common memory runtime trade-off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of fibo, you don't even need to cache everything :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[edit]
The author of the question seems to be looking for a general method to cache rather than a method to compute Fibonacci. Search wikipedia or look at the code of the other poster to get this answer. Those answers are linear in time and memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Here is a linear-time algorithm O(n), constant in memory *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;in OCaml:

let rec fibo n = 
    let rec aux = fun
        | 0 -&amp;gt; (1,1)
        | n -&amp;gt; let (cur, prec) = aux (n-1) in (cur+prec, cur)
    let (cur,prec) = aux n in prec;;



in C++:

int fibo(int n) {
    if (n == 0 ) return 1;
    if (n == 1 ) return 1;
    int p = fibo(0);
    int c = fibo(1);
    int buff = 0;
    for (int i=1; i &amp;lt; n; ++i) {
      buff = c;
      c = p+c;
      p = buff;
    };
    return c;
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This perform in linear time. But log is actually possible !!!
Roo's program is linear too, but way slower, and use memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is the log algorithm O(log(n))&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the log-time algorithm (way way way faster), here is a method :
If you know u(n), u(n-1), computing u(n+1), u(n) can be done by applying a matrix:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;| u(n+1) |  = | 1 1 | | u(n)   |
| u(n)   |    | 1 0 | | u(n-1) |
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that you have :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;| u(n)    |  = | 1 1 |^(n-1) | u(1) | = | 1 1 |^(n-1) | 1 |
| u(n-1)  |    | 1 0 |       | u(0) |   | 1 0 |       | 1 |
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computing the exponential of the matrix has a logarithmic complexity. 
Just implement recursively the idea :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;M^(0)    = Id
M^(2p+1) = (M^2p) * M
M^(2p)   = (M^p) * (M^p)  // of course don't compute M^p twice here.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also just diagonalize it (not to difficult), you will find the gold number and its conjugate in its eigenvalue, and the result will give you an EXACT mathematical formula for u(n). It contains powers of those eigenvalues, so that the complexity will still be logarithmic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fibo is often taken as an example to illustrate Dynamic Programming, but as you see, it is not really pertinent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@John:
I don't think it has anything to do with do with hash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@John2:
A map is a bit general don't you think? For Fibonacci case, all the keys are contiguous so that a vector is appropriate, once again there are much faster ways to compute fibo sequence, see my code sample over there.&lt;/p&gt;

Just like a table for an arithmatic operation, they go down one side, and find the outer bit sequence, then across the top and find the middle ones.  To answer your question, it could input and output the same number of bits, but this s-box is just set up to do it the way it does.  Its arbitrary.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The problem with this code is that it will generate stack overflow error for any number greater than 15 (in most computers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really? What computer are you using? It's taking a long time at 44, but the stack is not overflowing. In fact, your going to get a value bigger than an integer can hold (~4 billion unsigned, ~2 billion signed) before the stack is going to over flow (Fibbonaci(46)).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would work for what you want to do though (runs wiked fast)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Program
{
    public static readonly Dictionary&amp;lt;int,int&amp;gt; Items = new Dictionary&amp;lt;int,int&amp;gt;();
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(Fibbonacci(46).ToString());
        Console.ReadLine();
    }

    public static int Fibbonacci(int number)
    {
        if (number == 1 || number == 0)
        {
            return 1;
        }

        var minus2 = number - 2;
        var minus1 = number - 1;

        if (!Items.ContainsKey(minus2))
        {
            Items.Add(minus2, Fibbonacci(minus2));
        }

        if (!Items.ContainsKey(minus1))
        {
            Items.Add(minus1, Fibbonacci(minus1));
        }

        return (Items[minus2] + Items[minus1]);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent Linux kernel version allow you to pipe core dumps to a script or program. You could write a script to catch the core dump, collect any extra information you need and mail everything back. 
This is a global setting though, so it'd apply to any crashing program on the system. It will also require root rights to set up.
It can be configured through the /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern file. Set that to something like ' | /home/myuser/bin/my-core-handler-script'.&lt;/p&gt;

Work that includes maintaining a very large and soul destroying website that consists of a hodge podge of VBScript, javascript, Dreamweaver generated cruft and a collection of add-ons that various conmen have convinced them to buy over the years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I got a call "The website is locking up for people using Safari!" Okay, step one download Safari(v3.1.2), step two surf to the site. Everything appears to work fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short I finally isolated the problem and it relates to Safari's back button. The website uses a fancy-pants javascript menu that works in every browser I've tried including Safari, the first time around. But in Safari if you follow a link off the page and then hit the back button the menu no longer works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a pared down webpage to illustrate the principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Safari Back Button Test&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Load the page and you see the alert box. Then follow the link off the page and hit the back button. In IE and Firefox you see the alert box again, in Safari you do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a vigorous googling I've discovered others with similar problems but no really satisfactory answers. So my question is how can I make my pages work the same way in Safari after the user hits the back button as they do in other browsers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is a stupid question please be gentle, javascript is somewhat new to me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;.NET Strings are Immutable&lt;br /&gt;
  Therefore having an instance method makes absolutely no sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By that logic the string class should have no instance methods which return modified copies of the object, yet it has &lt;em&gt;plenty&lt;/em&gt; (Trim, ToUpper, and so on). Furthermore, lots of other objects in the framework do this too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree that if they were to make it an instance method, &lt;code&gt;Format&lt;/code&gt; seems like it would be a bad name, but that doesn't mean the functionality shouldn't be an instance method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Teifon: Um, Apple engineers do almost all of the active development on WebKit (WebKit is a MacOS system framework after all, and apple started the project (as a fork of khtml, but they are now substantially diverged)), non-apple developers focus almost entirely on their respective back and front ends (eg. gtk, qt, wx)  -- if you look at &lt;a href="http://trac.webkit.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;a href="http://trac.webkit.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://trac.webkit.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; you can see that fairly clearly the majority of dev work is from apple -- and the most active irc-ers are apple engineers, so i'm really not sure how you've come to the conclusion that webkit is somehow community minded when apple is not :D (Sorry for long reply, I'm just tired of seeing this particular misconception repeated :-/ )&lt;/p&gt;

Some of the hot shots will huff &amp;amp; puff but the actual best ones will think about what they have written and actually change variable names or layout - and perhaps even add a comment.&lt;/p&gt;

I recommend you give up looking for any logic behind the choice of term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here's my explanation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def foo():
   x = 3
   def bar():
      print x
   x = 5
   return bar

bar = foo()
bar()   # print 5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key idea here is that the function object returned from foo retains a hook to the local var 'x' even though 'x' has gone out of scope and should be defunct. This hook is to the var itself, not just the value that var had at the time, so when bar is called, it prints 5, not 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also be clear that Python 2.x has limited closure: there's no way I can modify 'x' inside 'bar' because writing 'x = bla' would declare a local 'x' in bar, not assign to 'x' of foo. This is a side-effect of Python's assignment=declaration. To get around this, Python 3.0 introduces the nonlocal keyword:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def foo():
   x = 3
   def bar():
      print x
   def ack():
      nonlocal x
      x = 7
   x = 5
   return (bar, ack)

bar, ack = foo()
ack()   # modify x of the call to foo
bar()   # print 7
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I was just trying to point out that spl&lt;em&gt;autoload&lt;/em&gt;register is a better alternative to &lt;em&gt;_autoload since you can define multiple loaders, and they won't conflict with each other. Handy if you have to include libraries that define an _&lt;/em&gt;autoload function as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you sure? The &lt;a href="http://www.php.net/function.spl_autoload_register" rel="nofollow"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; says differently:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If your code has an existing &lt;em&gt;_autoload function then this function must be explicitly registered on the _&lt;/em&gt;autoload stack. This is because spl&lt;em&gt;autoload&lt;/em&gt;register() will effectively replace the engine cache for the &lt;em&gt;_autoload function by either spl&lt;/em&gt;autoload() or spl&lt;em&gt;autoload&lt;/em&gt;call().&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;=&gt; you have to explicitly register any library's &lt;code&gt;__autoload&lt;/code&gt; as well. But apart from that you're of course right, this function is the better alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the WMI query necessary was a little less than straightfoward, since I needed not just a list of users for the whole machine, but the subset of users &lt;em&gt;and groups&lt;/em&gt;, whether local or domain, that were members of the local Administrators group. For the record, that WMI query was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT PartComponent FROM Win32_GroupUser WHERE GroupComponent = "Win32_Group.Domain='thehostname',Name='thegroupname'"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the full code snippet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public string GroupMembers(string targethost, string groupname, string targetusername, string targetpassword)
     {
      StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder(); 
      try
      {
       ConnectionOptions Conn = new ConnectionOptions();
       if (targethost != Environment.MachineName) //WMI errors if creds given for localhost
       {
        Conn.Username = targetusername; //can be null
        Conn.Password = targetpassword; //can be null
       }
       Conn.Timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2);
       ManagementScope scope = new ManagementScope("\\\\" + targethost + "\\root\\cimv2", Conn);
       scope.Connect();
       StringBuilder qs = new StringBuilder();
       qs.Append("SELECT PartComponent FROM Win32_GroupUser WHERE GroupComponent = \"Win32_Group.Domain='");
       qs.Append(targethost);
       qs.Append("',Name='");
       qs.Append(groupname);
       qs.AppendLine("'\"");
       ObjectQuery query = new ObjectQuery(qs.ToString());
       ManagementObjectSearcher searcher = new ManagementObjectSearcher(scope, query);
       ManagementObjectCollection queryCollection = searcher.Get();
       foreach (ManagementObject m in queryCollection)
       {
        ManagementPath path = new ManagementPath(m["PartComponent"].ToString());                                        
        { 
         String[] names = path.RelativePath.Split(',');
         result.Append(names[0].Substring(names[0].IndexOf("=") + 1).Replace("\"", " ").Trim() + "\\"); 
         result.AppendLine(names[1].Substring(names[1].IndexOf("=") + 1).Replace("\"", " ").Trim());                    
        }
       }
       return result.ToString();
      }
      catch (Exception e)
      {
       Console.WriteLine("Error. Message: " + e.Message);
       return "fail";
      }
     }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if I invoke Groupmembers("Server1", "Administrators", "myusername", "mypassword"); I get a single string returned with:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SERVER1\Administrator&lt;br /&gt;
MYDOMAIN\Domain Admins  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual WMI return is more like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\\SERVER1\root\cimv2:Win32_UserAccount.Domain="SERVER1",Name="Administrator"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... so as you can see, I had to do a little string manipulation to pretty it up.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Non-overloaded, non-inherited static methods (like Class.b(a,c)) that take an instance as the first variable are semantically equivalent to a method call (like a.b(c))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, they aren't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;(Assuming it compiles to the same CIL, which it should.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's your mistake. The CIL produced is different. The distinction is that member methods can't be invoked on &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; values so the CIL inserts a check against &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; values. This obviously isn't done in the static variant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;code&gt;String.Format&lt;/code&gt; does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; allow &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; values so the developers had to insert a check manually. From this point of view, the member method variant would be technically superior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each time new class is added I run command line builder script that scans whole directory tree in search for model classes then builds associative array with class names as keys and paths as values. Then, __autoload function looks up class name in that array and gets include path. Here's the code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;autobuild.php&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        unset($map[$className]);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that file naming convention must be [class_name].class.php. Alter the directories classes will be looked in &lt;code&gt;autobuild.php&lt;/code&gt;. You can also run autobuilder from autoload function when class not found, but that may get your program into infinite loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What good, C++ programming IDE is available for Linux?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minimums are fairly standard: syntax highlighting, code completion (like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliSense" rel="nofollow"&gt;intellisense&lt;/a&gt; or its Eclipse counterpart) and integrated debugging (e.g., basic
breakpoints).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have searched for it myself, but there are so many that it is almost impossible to separate the good from the bads by hand, especially for someone like me who has little  C++ coding experience in Linux. I know that &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Eclipse supports C++&lt;/a&gt;, and I really like that IDE for Java, but is it any good for C++ and is there something better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second post actually has some good suggestions, but what I am missing is what exactly makes the sugested IDE so good for the user, what are its (dis)advantages?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I noticed that this simply isn't how you work there*, and I threw everything out, spent a few days reading manuals, set up my shell (bash), set up a GVIM environment, learned the GCC/binutils toolchain, &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;gdb&lt;/code&gt; and lived happily ever after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are certainly disadvantages but I am sure that I work much more productive since making the switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*) It &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; isn't! And that's not an anachronism either because the toolchain described above is incredibly mature and powerful. Any IDE has to replicate hundreds of unique features to get anywhere near the power of these tools that have been honed to the point of perfection for decades. The learning curve might be quite steep, but much less so than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm only saying the following based on the title and your question, but:
Bear in mind that classes provide the advantage of methods and access control, as well. So if you wanted to ensure that people weren't changing weights to negative numbers, you could make the &lt;code&gt;weight&lt;/code&gt; field private and provide some accessor methods, like &lt;code&gt;getWeight()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;setWeight()&lt;/code&gt;. Inside &lt;code&gt;setWeight()&lt;/code&gt;, you could do some value checking, like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public function setWeight($weight)
{
    if($weight &amp;gt;= 0)
    {
        $this-&amp;gt;weight = $weight;
    }
    else
    {
        // Handle this scenario however you like

This is how Zend do it in &lt;a href="http://framework.zend.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Zend Framework&lt;/a&gt;. So when you call &lt;code&gt;Zend_Loader::loadClass("Zend_Db_Table");&lt;/code&gt; it explodes the classname into an array of directories by splitting on the underscores, and then the Zend_Loader class goes to load the required file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all the Zend modules, I would expect you can use just the loader on its own with your own classes but I have only used it as part of a site using Zend's MVC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there have been concerns about performance under load when you use any sort of dynamic class loading, for example see &lt;a href="http://blog.digitalstruct.com/2007/12/23/zend-framework-performance-zend_loader/" rel="nofollow"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; comparing Zend_Loader with hard loading of class files. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as the performance penalty of having to search the PHP include path, it defeats opcode caching. From a comment on that post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When using ANY Dynamic class loader APC cant cache those files fully as its not sure which files will load on any single request. By hard loading the files APC can cache them in full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you have a form field that will only ever accept integers, make sure you're implementing something at both the client-side AND the server-side to sanitise the data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check and double check any input data especially if it's going to end up in an SQL query. I suggest building an escaper function and wrap it around anything going into a query. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I recall correctly (I didn't actually verify this because I don't have an old IDE handy), early versions of the C# IDE had trouble detecting method calls against string literals in IntelliSense, and that has a big impact on the discoverability of the API.  If that was the case, typing the following wouldn't give you any help:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;"{0}".Format(12);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were forced to type &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;new String("{0}").Format(12);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be clear that there was no advantage to making the Format method an instance method rather than a static method.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The .NET libraries were designed by a lot of the same people that gave us MFC, and the String class in particular bears a strong resemblance to the CString class in MFC.  MFC does have an instance Format method (that uses printf style formatting codes rather than the curly-brace style of .NET) which is painful because there's no such thing as a CString literal.  So in a MFC codebase that I worked on I see a lot of this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CString csTemp = "";
csTemp.Format("Some string: %s", szFoo);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which is painful.  (I'm not saying that the code above is a great way to do things even in MFC, but that does seem to be the way that most of the developers on the project learned how to use CString::Format).  Coming from that heritage, I can imagine that the API designers were trying to avoid that sort of situation again.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It's the speed that I am thinking of mostly, for anything more complex than what I have here I'd probably go with classes but the question is, what is the cost of a class?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would seem to be premature optimisation. Your application isn't going to take any real-world performance hit either way, but using a class lets you use getter and setter methods and is generally going to be better for code encapsulation and code reuse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the arrays you're incurring cost in harder to read and maintain code, you can't unit test the code as easily and with a good class structure other developers should find it easier to understand if they need to take it on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when later on you need to add other methods to manipulate these, you won't have an architecture to extend.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;could you clarify a little bit more how it was for you, what you had to change. Maybe you could point me in the right direction by providing some links to the information you used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first source were actually the tools' &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; pages. Just type&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ man toolname
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on the command line (&lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; here is part of the prompt, not the input).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the platform, they're quite well-written and can also be found on the internet. In the case of &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;, I actually read the complete &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; which took a few hours. Actually, I don't think this is necessary or helpful in most cases but I had a few special requirements in my first assignments under Linux that required a sophisticated makefile. After writing the makefile I gave it to an experienced colleague who did some minor tweaks and corrections. After that, I pretty much knew &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used GVIM because I had some (but not much) prior experience there, I can't say anything at all about Emacs or alternatives. I find it really helps to read other peoples' &lt;code&gt;.gvimrc&lt;/code&gt; config file. Many people put it on the web. Here's &lt;a href="http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/krudolph/stuff/gvimrc.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't try to master all binutils at once, there are too many functions. But get a general overview so you'll know where to search when needing something in the future. You &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;, however, know all the important parameters for &lt;code&gt;g++&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ld&lt;/code&gt; (the GCC linker tool that's invoked automatically except when explicitly prevented).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Also I'm curious, do you have code completion and syntax highlighting when you code?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syntax highlighting: yes, and a much better one than Visual Studio. Code completion: yes-&lt;em&gt;ish&lt;/em&gt;. First, I have to admit that I didn't use C++ code completion even in Visual Studio because (compared to VB and C#) it wasn't good enough. I don't use it often now but nevertheless, GVIM &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; native code completion support for C++. Combined with the &lt;a href="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow"&gt;ctags&lt;/a&gt; library and a plug-in like &lt;a href="http://vim-taglist.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow"&gt;taglist&lt;/a&gt; this is almost an IDE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, what got me started was an &lt;a href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/articles/vim-as-development-environment" rel="nofollow"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; by Armin Ronacher. Before reading the text, look at the screenshots at the end of it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;do you have to compile first before getting (syntax) errors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. But this is the same for Visual Studio, isn't it (I've never used Whole Tomato)? Of course, the syntax highlighting will show you non-matching brackets but that's about all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;and how do you debug (again think breakpoints etc)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;code&gt;gdb&lt;/code&gt; which is a command-line tool. There's also a graphical frontend called &lt;code&gt;DDD&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;gdb&lt;/code&gt; is a modern debugging tool and can do everything you can do in an IDE. The only thing that really annoys me is reading a stack trace because lines aren't indented or formatted so it's really hard to scan the information when you're using a lot of templates (which I do). But those also clutter the stack trace in IDEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Like I said, I had the 'pleasure' to set my first steps in the Java programming language using windows notepad and the command line java compiler in high school, and it was, .. wel a nightmare! certainly when I could compare it with other programming courses I had back then where we had decent IDE's&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You shouldn't even try to compare a modern, full-feature editor like Emacs or GVIM to Notepad. Notepad is an embellished &lt;code&gt;TextBox&lt;/code&gt; control, and this really makes all the difference. Additionally, working on the command line is a very different experience in Linux and Windows. The Windows &lt;code&gt;cmd.exe&lt;/code&gt; is severely crippled. PowerShell is much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/EDIT: I should mention explicitly that &lt;strong&gt;GVIM has tabbed editing&lt;/strong&gt; (as in tabbed browsing, not tabs-vs-spaces)! It took me ages to find them although they're not hidden at all. Just type &lt;code&gt;:tabe&lt;/code&gt; instead of plain &lt;code&gt;:e&lt;/code&gt; when opening a file or creating a new one, and GVIM will create a new tab. Switching between tabs can be done using the cursor or several different shortcuts (depending on the platform). The key &lt;code&gt;gt&lt;/code&gt; (type &lt;kbd&gt;g&lt;/kbd&gt;, then &lt;kbd&gt;t&lt;/kbd&gt; in command mode) should work everywhere, and jumps to the next tab, or tab no. &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; if a number was given. Type &lt;code&gt;:help gt&lt;/code&gt; to get more help.&lt;/p&gt;

This works great in cases where the object is still serializable, and I'm only changing to a custom deep clone for perf reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I like to add a debug mode check to all of my Clone implementations using something like this&lt;/p&gt;

        }
    }
    Debug.Assert(test == expected, string.Format("field: {0}", lastField));

&lt;p&gt;This method relies on an accurate implementation of Equals on any nested members, but in my case anything that is cloneable is also equatable&lt;/p&gt;

For example, think of a quicksort - you can separate the list you're sorting into multiple "chunks" and sort each separately in their own thread. SQL engines can do similar things with huge amounts of data in one set-based query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you perform cursor-based operations, the engine can only run sequentially and the operation has to be single threaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I think of TDD or Test Driven Design, the Unit Tests serve the purpose of driving out the &lt;a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/evolution.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;evolutionary design&lt;/a&gt; of the system, hopefully ensuring continuous improvement.&lt;br/&gt; Writing the test shapes the code or highlights issues with a decision that has already been made, hopefully resulting in a refactoring process to increase the quality of design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, the senior developer is normally the person with the most experience and ability, which means that they should be in a better position to spot these refactoring opportunities. (Detect the code smells)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three situations I can think of, off the top of my head, where someone else writing the tests for you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing" rel="nofollow"&gt;Acceptance Tests&lt;/a&gt;/Customer Tests/End To End Tests. Call them what you will, but I mean the tests that start at the data input point, (web service, web page, application screen input), and traverse the entire stack of the system, (to a database, call to another service, back round to the input results screen etc). This could be written by someone who is not implementing the details of the individual units that will be exercised by the tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paired Programming (&lt;a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PairProgrammingPingPongPattern" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ping Pong Pattern&lt;/a&gt;) -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A writes a new test and sees that it
  fails.&lt;br/&gt;B implements the code needed
  to pass the test.&lt;br/&gt; B writes the next
  test.&lt;br/&gt;A implements it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bug Fix Tests - When a bug is found, it is often good practice to write a failing test that exposes the defect. Once this test is in place it is entirely possible that someone implements the code that makes the test pass. I don't think that this is all that good an idea as the act of writing the test that fails due to the defect often gives some insights as to how a fix might be produced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short my answer to your first question would be, no a senior developer should not be exempt from writing unit tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part II&lt;/strong&gt; (Motivating people to write tests)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something that I have had problems with in the past. Even though I now try and perform TDD as often is appropriate, it took me a few months to see that there was a real benefit to writing tests.&lt;br/&gt;
I believe that trying to show others the benefits of TDD and Unit Testing is quite difficult. It is only when the person experiences for themselves, that 'ah ha' moment when TDD/Unit Tests have highlighted a subtlety in their code, that they might have otherwise missed, or helped them fix a bug in short amount of time, that they see the benefits.
Getting them to that point can be quite difficult.&lt;br/&gt;
Personally I got there by pair programming in the aforementioned Ping Pong Pattern, working with an experienced TDDer and seeing the code we were writing to solve a non-trivial piece of functionality evolve into what might be called an elegant solution. Followed by that piece of work making it through QA and into the Live Environment without any defects raised against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, I think that pairing with an experienced programmer who is already convinced of the benefits that come from writing Unit Tests is a great way to help someone become motivated to writing unit tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am already using the SqlClient.SqlBulkCopy (which is based on TDS) to speed up the data transfer across the wire which helped a lot, but I'm still looking for more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a simple table that looks like this: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; CREATE TABLE [BulkData](
 [ContainerId] [int] NOT NULL,
 [BinId] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 [Sequence] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 [ItemId] [int] NOT NULL,
 [Left] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 [Top] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 [Right] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 [Bottom] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 CONSTRAINT [PKBulkData] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED 
 (
  [ContainerIdId] ASC,
  [BinId] ASC,
  [Sequence] ASC
))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm inserting data in chunks that average about 300 rows where ContainerId and BinId are constant in each chunk and the Sequence value is 0-n and the values are pre-sorted based on the primary key.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The %Disk time performance counter spends a lot of time at 100% so it is clear that disk IO is the main issue but the speeds I'm getting are several orders of magnitude below a raw file copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it help any if I:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drop the Primary key while I am doing the inserting and recreate it later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do inserts into a temporary table with the same schema and periodically transfer them into the main table to keep the size of the table where insertions are happening small&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anything else?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--
Based on the responses I have gotten, let me clarify a little bit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portman: I'm using a clustered index because when the data is all imported I will need to access data sequentially in that order.  I don't particularly need the index to be there while importing the data.  Is there any advantage to having a nonclustered PK index while doing the inserts as opposed to dropping the constraint entirely for import?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chopeen:  The data is being generated remotely on many other machines (my SQL server can only handle about 10 currently, but I would love to be able to add more).  It's not practical to run the entire process on the local machine because it would then have to process 50 times as much input data to generate the output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason: I am not doing any concurrent queries against the table during the import process, I will try dropping the primary key and see if that helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pulling data out to the middle tier to process it can be useful, though, because it removes the processing overhead off the DB server (which is the hardest thing to scale, and is normally doing other things as well). Also, you normally don't have the same overheads (or benefits) in the middle tier.

&lt;p&gt;Out of curiosity, why is your index set up like that? It seems like ContainerId/BinId/Sequence is &lt;strong&gt;much&lt;/strong&gt; better suited to be a nonclustered index. Is there a particular reason you wanted this index to be clustered?&lt;/p&gt;

Generally, a set based language is going to be more efficient, because that is what it was designed to do. There are two places where a cursor is at an advantage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are updating a large data set in a database where locking rows is not acceptable (during production hours maybe). A set based update has a possibility of locking a table for several seconds (or minutes), where a cursor (if written correctly) does not. The cursor can meander through the rows updating one at a time and you don't have to worry about affecting anything else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advantage to using SQL is that the bulk of the work for optimization is handled by the database engine in most circumstances.  With the enterprise class db engines the designers have gone to painstaking lengths to make sure the system is efficient at handling data.  The drawback is that SQL is a set based language.  You have to be able to define a set of data to use it.  Although this sounds easy, in some circumstances it is not. A query can be so complex that the internal optimizers in the engine can't effectively create an execution path, and guess what happens... your super powerful box with 32 processors uses a single thread to execute the query because it doesn't know how to do anything else, so you waste processor time on the database server which generally there is only one of as opposed to multiple application servers  (so back to reason 1, you run into resource contentions with other things needing to run on the database server).  With a row based language (C#, PHP, JAVA etc.), you have more control as to what happens.  You can retrieve a data set and force it to execute the way you want it to. (Separate the data set out to run on multiple threads etc).  Most of the time, it still isn't going to be efficient as running it on the database engine, because it will still have to access the engine to update the row, but when you have to do 1000+ calculations to update a row (and lets say you have a million rows), a database server can start to have problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Also, are they unique to Java, is there a C++ equivalent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, but VB and C# have &lt;a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/dotnetattributes.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt; which are the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their use is quite diverse. One typical Java example, &lt;code&gt;@Override&lt;/code&gt; has no effect on the code but it can be used by the compiler to generate a warning (or error) if the decorated method doesn't actually override another method. Similarly, methods can be marked obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there's reflection. When you reflect a type of a class in your code, you can access the attributes and act according to the information found there. I don't know any examples in Java but in .NET this is used by the compiler to generate &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.serializableattribute.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;(de)serialization&lt;/a&gt; information for classes, determine the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.interopservices.structlayoutattribute.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;memory layout&lt;/a&gt; of structures and &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.interopservices.dllimportattribute.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;declare function imports&lt;/a&gt; from legacy libraries (among others). They also control how the IDE form designer works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/EDIT: Attributes on classes are comparable to tag interfaces (like &lt;a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Serializable&lt;/a&gt; in Java). However, the .NET coding guidelines say not to use tag interfaces. Also, they only work on class level, not on method level.&lt;/p&gt;

it is possible. You can create library with window hook proc using managed C++. All you need to do is to inject this hook into some application using standard WinAPI (SetWindowsHookEx etc.). Inside this hook you can call System::AppDomain::CurrentDomain-&gt;Load method to load your assembly into target application's AppDomain.

Usually, it means we code review. We try to make it a habit around the team that reviews are an inherent part of writing code. You write it, then ask someone for an opinion.&lt;br /&gt;
Also, on projects where we have enough people available (are when the tasks are of right size) we try to pair programming.&lt;br /&gt;
I must say we have definitely seen an advantage to this. First of all, it's a great way to mentor junior developers in the team - when you review their code you get to show them what can be done better, and when pairing with them they get to see better ways of doing stuff, how experienced people think and even how to use the IDE better.&lt;br /&gt;
Also, it keeps the whole team in sync as far as knowing how the code looks.&lt;br /&gt;
And, furthermore, it simply increases everyone's joy and personal development - a team that is capable of talking and reasoning about code is a better team, a team that keeps learning and sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things to watch out for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure seniors let juniors program too when pairing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't let people pair on small tasks, usually wastes time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch how pairs get along (don't force a pair together)&lt;/li&gt;

You'd probably find it more likely to be able to find work in Dotnet than Delphi these days.&lt;/p&gt;

Few people use OOP in any rigorous sense (few people adhere to or understand principles such as LSP); there seems to be little uniformity or consistency to the approaches that people take to modelling problem domains.  All too often, the class is used simply for its syntactic sugar; it puts the functions for a record type into their own little namespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've written a large amount of code for a wide variety of applications. Although there have been places where true substitutable subtyping played a valuable role in the application, these have been pretty exceptional. In general, though much lip service is given to talk of "re-use" the reality is that unless a piece of code does &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what you want it to do, there's very little cost-effective "re-use".  It's extremely hard to design classes to be extensible &lt;em&gt;in the right way&lt;/em&gt;, and so the cost of extension is normally so great that "re-use" simply isn't worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many regards, this doesn't surprise me.  The real world isn't "OO", and the idea implicit in OO--that we can model things with some class taxonomy--seems to me very fundamentally flawed (I can sit on a table, a tree stump, a car bonnet, someone's lap--but not one of those is-a chair).  Even if we move to more abstract domains, OO modelling is often difficult, counterintuitive, and ultimately unhelpful (consider the classic examples of circles/ellipses or squares/rectangles).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what am I missing here? Where's the value of OOP, and why has all the time and money failed to make software any better?&lt;/p&gt;

I would argue that it actually &lt;strong&gt;has&lt;/strong&gt; reduced costs, made large software projects manageable, and so forth. That doesn't mean it's solved the fundamental problem of software messiness, and it doesn't mean the average developer is an OOP expert. But the modularization of function into object-components has certainly reduced the amount of spaghetti code out there in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can think of dozens of libraries off the top of my head which are beautifully reusable and which have saved time and money that can never be calculated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to the extent that OOP has been a waste of time, I'd say it's because of lack of programmer training, compounded by the steep learning curve of learning a language specific OOP mapping. Some people "get" OOP and others never will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is true and has been observed by other people (take Stepanov, inventor of the STL), the rest is nonsense. OOP may be flawed and it certainly is no silver bullet but it makes large-scale applications much simpler because it's a great way to reduce dependencies. Of course, this is only true for good OOP design. Sloppy design won't give any advantage. But good, decoupled design can be modelled very well using OOP and not well using other techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well @jschroedl thats was fun indeed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing an activex in console app is fun. But I think its worth not trying down that path. You can call the methods or set and get the properties either through the way @jschroedl had explained or you can call the IDIspatch object through the Invoke function. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is to GetIDsByName and call the function through Invoke and parameters to the function should be an array of VARIANTS in the Invoke formal parameter list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All is fine and dandy. But once you get to events its downhill from there. Windows application requires a message pump to fire events. On a console you don't have one. I went down the path to implement a EventNotifier for the events just like you implement a CallBack interface in classic C++ way. But the events doesn't get to your implemented interface. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am pretty sure this cannot be done on a console application. But I am really hoping someone out there will have a different take on events in a console application&lt;/p&gt;

Other than using messaging, it's hard for me to imagine other approach.  The main benefit I see totally in line with what CodingTheWheel said: modularisation.  OO naturally leads me to construct my applications from modular components that have clean interfaces and clear responsibilities (i.e. loosely coupled, highly cohesive code with a clear separation of concerns).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think where OO breaks down is when people create deeply nested class heirarchies.  This can lead to complexity.  However, factoring out common finctionality into a base class, then reusing that in other descendant classes is a deeply elegant thing, IMHO!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But to the extent that OOP has been a waste of time, I'd say it's because of lack of programmer training, compounded by the steep learning curve of learning a language specific OOP mapping. Some people "get" OOP and others never will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dunno if that's really surprising, though.  I think that technically sound approaches (LSP being the obvious thing) make &lt;em&gt;hard to use&lt;/em&gt;, but if we don't use such approaches it makes the code brittle and inextensible anyway (because we can no longer reason about it).  And I think the counterintuitive results that OOP leads us to makes it unsurprising that people don't pick it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More significantly, since software is already fundamentally too hard for normal humans to write reliably and accurately, should we really be extolling a technique that is consistently taught poorly and appears hard to learn? If the benefits were clear-cut then it might be worth persevering in spite of the difficulty, but that doesn't seem to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But "procedural" developers have been doing that for decades anyway.  The syntax and terminology might differ, but the effect is identical.  There is more to OOP than "reusing common functionality in a base class", and I might even go so far as to say that that is hard to describe as OOP at all; calling the same function from different bits of code is a technique as old as the subprocedure itself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;OOP may be flawed and it certainly is no silver bullet but it makes large-scale applications much simpler because it's a great way to reduce dependencies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the dogma. I am not seeing what makes OOP significantly better in this regard than procedural programming of old. Whenever I make a procedure call I am isolating myself from the specifics of the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

The idea is that you can pass functions as parameters to other functions and return them as values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functional programming involves writing code that does not change state. The primary reason for doing so is so that successive calls to a function will yield the same result. You can write functional code in any language that supports first-class functions, but there are some languages, like Haskell, which do not allow you to change state. In fact, you're not supposed to make any side effects (like printing out text) at all - which sounds like it could be completely useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haskell instead employs a different approach to IO: monads. These are objects that contain the desired IO operation to be executed by your interpreter's toplevel. At any other level they are simply objects in the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What advantages does functional programming provide? Functional programming allows coding with fewer potentials for bugs because each component is completely isolated. Also, using recursion and first-class functions allows for simple proofs of correctness which typically mirror the structure of the code.&lt;/p&gt;

The Mono implementation is nevertheless still large enough for enterprise(y) applications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the IDE corner: At a talk with Anders Hejlsberg (one of the designers of C#), he mentioned that using the .NET platform without code-completion stopped even seasoned testers in their tracks. After that I decided to try out Eclipse and MonoDevelop, both of which have code-completion, but found their abstraction layers prevented me from understanding how the framework really functions.

And when/if your page ever loads on MSDN, the documentation you'll find there is also very good. Peter Seestoft has also written a generic collections library for c#: &lt;a href="http://www.itu.dk/research/c5/" rel="nofollow"&gt;C5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to what strengths .NET has: It's big (as Java). It's integrated into the Windows platform. A lot of jobs are available if you can use the .NET framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But - as always - I would recommend Python for great fun when unpaid. (You can also access the .NET framework through IronPython, a Microsoft implementation of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython" rel="nofollow"&gt;CPython&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

Let me give an example.  In Java, I often find myself creating maps to record structures, and thus writing getOrCreate structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SomeKindOfRecord&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; getOrCreate(T thing) { 
    if(localMap.contains(t)) { return localMap.get(t); }

    localMap = localMap.put(t,record);
    return record; 
}

                  Function&amp;lt;RT&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt; thingConstructor, 
                  Map&amp;lt;T,RT&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt; localMap) {

    localMap = localMap.put(t,record);
    return record; 
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and I would never have to write a new one of these again, I could inherit it. But I could do one better then inheriting, I could say in the constructor of this thing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;getOrCreate = myLib.getOrCreate(*,
                                SomeKindOfRecord&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;.constructor(&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;), 
                                localMap);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(where * is a kind of "leave this parameter open" notation, which is a sort of currying)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then the local getOrCreate is exactly the same as it would have been if I wrote out the whole thing, in one line, with no inheritance dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of combining files, this too would be easy to do with the current YUI Compressor and a command line (as I'm sure you already know), but the projects that I've worked on have opted for combining JS files at runtime before sending down to the client.  This allows for greater flexibility of picking and choosing appropriate JS packages for a specific users' current needs (and thus minimizing the amount of JS being sent to the client while trying, of course, to balance these packages in an appropriate browser caching scheme).

I've used them to successfully transform everything from plain text CSV files, from existing SQL tables, and even from XLS files with 6-digit rows spanned across multiple worksheets. You could use C# to transform the data into an importable format (CSV, XLS, etc), then have your SQL server run a scheduled SSIS job to import the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's pretty easy to create an SSIS package, there's a wizard built-into SQL Server's Enterprise Manager tool (labeled "Import Data" I think), and at the end of the wizard it gives you the option of saving it as an SSIS package.

This idea leads to the notion of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that seperates the interface from implementation. These are hugely important concepts and the basis for putting a framework in place to think about program design in a different way and better (I think) way. You can't really argue against those properties - there is no trade-off made and it is always a cleaner way to modulize things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other aspects of OOP including inheritance and polymorphism are important too, but as others have alluded to, those are commonly over used. ie: Sometimes people use inheritance and/or polymorphism because they can, not because they should have. They are powerful concepts and very useful, but need to be used wisely and are not automatic winning advantages of OOP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relative to re-use. I agree re-use is over sold for OOP. It is a possible side effect of well defined objects, typically of more primitive/generic classes and is a direct result of the encapsulation and information hiding concepts. It is potentially easier to be re-used because the interfaces of well defined classes are just simply clearer and somewhat self documenting.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Relative to straight procedural programming, the first fundamental tenet of OOP is the notion of information hiding and encapsulation. This idea leads to the notion of the class that seperates the interface from implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which has the more hidden implementation: C++'s iostreams, or C's FILE*s?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the use of opaque context objects (HANDLEs in Win32, FILE*s in C, to name two well-known examples--hell, HANDLEs live on the other side of the kernel-mode barrier, and it really doesn't get much more encapsulated than that) is found in procedural code too; I'm struggling to see how this is something particular to OOP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose that may be a part of why I'm struggling to see the benefits: the parts that are obviously good are not specific to OOP, whereas the parts that are specific to OOP are not obviously good! (this is not to say that they are necessarily bad, but rather that I have not seen the evidence that they are widely-applicable and consistently beneficial).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;HANDLEs (and the rest of the WinAPI) is OOP!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Are they, though? They're not inheritable, they're certainly not substitutable, they lack well-defined classes... I think they fall a long way short of "OOP".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever created a window using WinAPI? Then you should know that you define a class (&lt;code&gt;RegisterClass&lt;/code&gt;), create an instance of it (&lt;code&gt;CreateWindow&lt;/code&gt;), call virtual methods (&lt;code&gt;WndProc&lt;/code&gt;) and base-class methods (&lt;code&gt;DefWindowProc&lt;/code&gt;) and so on. WinAPI even takes the nomenclature from SmallTalk OOP, calling the methods messages (Window Messages).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handles may not be inheritable but then, there's &lt;code&gt;final&lt;/code&gt; in Java. They don't lack a class, they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; a placeholder for the class: That's what the word handle means. Looking at architectures like MFC or .NET WinForms it's immediately obvious that except for the syntax, nothing much is different from the WinAPI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I find this to be too prevalent as well. This is not Object Oriented Programming. It's Object Based Programming and data centric programing. In my 10 years of working with OO Languages, I see people mostly doing Object Based Programming. OBP breaks down very quickly IMHO since you are essentially getting the worst of both words: 1) Procedural programming without adhering to proven structured programming methodology and 2) OOP without adhering to to proven OOP methodology.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OOP done right is a beautiful thing. It makes very difficult problems easy to solve, and to the uninitiated (not trying to sound pompous there), it can almost seem like magic. That being said, OOP is just one tool in the toolbox of programming methodologies. It is not the be all end all methodology. It just happens to suit large business applications well.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most developers who work in OOP languages are utilizing examples of OOP done right in the frameworks and types that they use day-to-day, but they just aren't aware of it. Here are some very simple examples: ADO.NET, Hibernate/NHibernate, Logging Frameworks, various language collection types, the ASP.NET stack, The JSP stack etc... These are all things that heavily rely on OOP in their codebases.&lt;/p&gt;

However, Python programmers think more about whether an object type is &lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;. Mutable objects can be changed in-place (e.g., dictionaries, lists, user-defined objects), whereas immutable objects can't (e.g., integers, strings, tuples).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following example shows a function that is passed two arguments, an immutable string, and a mutable list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; def do_something(a, b):
...     a = "Red"
...     b.append("Blue")
... 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a = "Yellow"
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b = ["Black", "Burgundy"]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; do_something(a, b)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print a, b
Yellow ['Black', 'Burgundy', 'Blue']
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The line &lt;code&gt;a = "Red"&lt;/code&gt; merely creates a local name, &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, for the string value &lt;code&gt;"Red"&lt;/code&gt; and has no effect on the passed-in argument (which is now hidden, as &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; must refer to the local name from then on). Assignment is not an in-place operation, regardless of whether the argument is mutable or immutable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; parameter is a reference to a mutable list object, and the &lt;code&gt;.append()&lt;/code&gt; method performs an in-place extension of the list, tacking on the new &lt;code&gt;"Blue"&lt;/code&gt; string value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Because string objects are immutable, they don't have any methods that support in-place modifications.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the function returns, the re-assignment of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; has had no effect, while the extension of &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; clearly shows pass-by-reference style call semantics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, even if the argument for &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is a mutable type, the re-assignment within the function is not an in-place operation, and so there would be no change to the passed argument's value:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a = ["Purple", "Violet"]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; do_something(a, b)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print a, b
['Purple', 'Violet'] ['Black', 'Burgundy', 'Blue', 'Blue']
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you didn't want your list modified by the called function, you would instead use the immutable tuple type (identified by the parentheses in the literal form, rather than square brackets), which does not support the in-place &lt;code&gt;.append()&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a = "Yellow"
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b = ("Black", "Burgundy")
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; do_something(a, b)

&lt;p&gt;MySQL-specific libraries are fine, but bear in mind that you are locking yourself down to one DB implementation - if you ever need to change in the future it's gonna be a whole lot of work - even if you design your code such that the DB-specific stuff is behind a facade.

The &lt;code&gt;__iter__&lt;/code&gt; returns the iterator object and is implicitly called at the start of loops.  The &lt;code&gt;next()&lt;/code&gt; method returns the next value and is implicitly called at each loop increment.  &lt;code&gt;next()&lt;/code&gt; raises a StopIteration exception when there are no more value to return, which is implicitly captured by looping constructs to stop iterating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a simple example of a counter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Counter:
    def __init__(self, low, high):
        self.current = low
        self.high = high

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def next(self): # Python 3: def __next__(self)
        if self.current &amp;gt; self.high:
            raise StopIteration
        else:
            self.current += 1
            return self.current - 1


for c in Counter(3, 8):
    print c
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;3
4
5
6
7
8
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is easier to write using a generator, as covered in a previous answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def counter(low, high):
    current = low
    while current &amp;lt;= high:
        yield current
        current += 1

for c in counter(3, 8):
    print c
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The printed output will be the same.  Under the hood, the generator object supports the iterator protocol and does something roughly similar to the class Counter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't be thinking you'll just import a modern page into Flash and it'll render - that ain't going to happen. This stuff is for styling text areas. You won't get JavaScript executing because you're reliant on the subset of HTML and CSS that Flash supports in a text object, and Flash has a different object model from a web page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very least, make sure old cookies lose their value after a while. Even a successful hijaking attack will be thwarted when the cookie stops working. If the user has a cookie from a session that logged in more than a month ago, make them reenter their password. Make sure that whenever a user clicks on your site's "log out" link, that the old session UUID can never be used again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if this idea will work but here goes: Add a serial number into your session cookie, maybe a string like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SessionUUID, Serial Num, Current Date/Time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encrypt this string and use it as your session cookie. Regularly change the serial num - maybe when the cookie is 5 minutes old and then reissue the cookie.  You could even reissue it on every page view if you wanted to. On the server side, keep a record of the last serial num you've issued for that session.  If someone ever sends a cookie with the wrong serial number it means that an attacker may be using a cookie they intercepted earlier so invalidate the session UUID and ask the user to reenter their password and then reissue a new cookie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that your user may have more than one computer so they may have more than one active session. Don't do something that forces them to log in again every time they switch between computers.&lt;/p&gt;

Take Doubt's example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The rule with goto that we use is that goto is okay to for jumping forward to a single exit cleanup point in a function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is true  but only if the language doesn't allow structured exception handling with cleanup code (such as RAII or &lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt;), which does the same job better (as it is specially built for doing it), or when there's a good reason not to employ structured exception handling (but you will never have this case except at a very low level).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most other languages, the only acceptable use of &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt; is to exit nested loops. And even there it is almost always better to lift the outer loop into an own method and use &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt; is a sign that not enough thought has gone into the particular piece of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Modern languages which support &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt; implement some restrictions (e.g. &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt; may not jump into or out of functions) but the problem fundamentally remains the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, the same is of course also true for other language features, most notably exceptions. And there are usually strict rules in place to only use these features where indicated, such as the rule not to use exceptions to control non-exceptional program flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cleanly exiting a function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often in a function, you may allocate resources and need to exit in multiple places.  Programmers can simplify their code by putting the resource cleanup code at the end of the function, and all "exit points" of the function would goto the cleanup label.  This way, you don't have to write cleanup code at every "exit point" of the function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exiting nested loops&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're in a nested loop and need to break out of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; loops, a goto can make this much cleaner and simpler than break statements and if-checks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low-level performance improvements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is only valid in perf-critical code, but goto statements execute very quickly and can give you a boost when moving through a function.  This is a double-edged sword, however, because a compiler typically cannot optimize code that contains gotos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that in all these examples, gotos are restricted to the scope of a single function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our experiences is that you can potentially get much better performance than typical relational databases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, you really have to tweak your objects to get this kind of performance. For example, if you've got a list containing a lot of objects, DB4O activation of these lists is slow. There are a number of ways to get around this problem, for example, by inverting the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another pain is activation. When you retrieve or delete an object from DB4O, by default it will activate the whole object tree. For example, loading a Foo will load Foo.Bar.Baz.Bat, etc until there's nothing left to load. While this is nice from a programming standpoint, performance will slow down the more nesting in your objects. To improve performance, you can tell DB4O how many levels deep to activate. This is time-consuming to do if you've got a lot of objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area of pain was text searching. DB4O's text searching is far, far slower than SQL full text indexing. (They'll tell you this outright on their site.) The good news is, it's easy to setup a text searching engine on top of DB4O. On our project, we've hooked up Lucene.NET to index the text fields we want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some APIs don't seem to work, such as the GetField APIs useful in applying database upgrades. (For example, you've renamed a property and you want to upgrade your existing objects in the database, you need to use these "reflection" APIs to find objects in the database. Other APIs, such as the [Index] attribute don't work in the stable 6.4 version, and you must instead specify indexes using the Configure().Index("someField"), which is not strongly typed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've witnessed performance degrade the larger your database. We have a 1GB database right now and things are still fast, but not nearly as fast as when we started with a tiny database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've found another issue where Db4O.GetByID will close the database if the ID doesn't exist anymore in the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've found the Native Query syntax (the most natural, language-integrated syntax for queries) is far, far slower than the less-friendly SODA queries. So instead of typing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// C# syntax for "Find all MyFoos with Bar == 23".
// (Note the Java syntax is more verbose using the Predicate class.)
IList&amp;lt;MyFoo&amp;gt; results = db4o.Query&amp;lt;MyFoo&amp;gt;(input =&amp;gt; input.Bar == 23);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of that nice query code, you have to an ugly SODA query which is string-based and not strongly-typed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For .NET folks, they've recently introduced a LINQ-to-DB4O provider, which provides for the best syntax yet. However, it's yet to be seen whether performance will be up-to-par with the ugly SODA queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DB4O support has been decent: we've talked to them on the phone a number of times and have received helpful info. Their user forums are next to worthless, however, almost all questions go unanswered. Their JIRA bug tracker receives a lot of attention, so if you've got a nagging bug, file it on JIRA on it often will get fixed. (We've had 2 bugs that have been fixed, and another one that got patched in a half-assed way.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all this hasn't scared you off, let me say that we're very happy with DB4O, despite the problems we've encountered. The performance we've got has blown away some O/RM frameworks we tried. I recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Validating all the world's post/zip codes is too hard; a fixed list of countries is too politically sensitive; mandatory state/region/other administrative subdivision is just plain inappropriate (all too often I'm asked which county I live in--when I don't, because Greater London is not a county at all).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More to the point, it's simply unnecessary. Your application is highly unlikely to be modelling addresses in any serious way. If you want a postal address, ask for the postal address. Most people aren't so stupid as to put in something other than a postal address, and if they do, they can kiss their newly purchased item bye-bye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exception to this is if you're doing something that's naturally constrained to one country anyway.  In this situation, you should ask for, say, the { postcode, house number } pair, which is enough to identify a postal address.  I imagine you could achieve similar things with the extended zip code in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If so, why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C has no multi-level/labelled break, and not all control flows can be easily modelled with C's iteration and decision primitives.  gotos go a long way towards redressing these flaws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it's clearer to use a flag variable of some kind to effect a kind of pseudo-multi-level break, but it's not always superior to the goto (at least a goto allows one to easily determine where control goes to, unlike a flag variable), and sometimes you simply don't want to pay the performance price of flags/other contortions to avoid the goto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;libavcodec is a performance-sensitive piece of code. Direct expression of the control flow is probably a priority, because it'll tend to run better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;loop1:
  a
loop2:
  b
  if(cond1) goto loop1
  c
  if(cond2) goto loop2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would create the bizarre, but possibly legal flow-of-control structure where a sequence like (a, b, c, b, a, b, a, b, ...) is possible, which makes compiler hackers unhappy. Apparently there are a number of clever optimization tricks that rely on this type of structure not occuring. (I should check my copy of the dragon book...) The result of this might (using some compilers) be that other optimizations aren't done for code that contains &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be useful if you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; it just, "oh, by the way", happens to persuade the compiler to emit faster code. Personally, I'd prefer to try to explain to the compiler about what's probable and what's not before using a trick like goto, but arguably, I might also try &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt; before hacking assembler.&lt;/p&gt;

When the domain of numbers you operate on is just 1 and 0, then they are exactly the same, but in cases where your booleans are not strictly 1 and 0--as is the case with the c language--you may end up with some behavior you didn't want.

&lt;p&gt;From there, you will get to choose your origin and destination data sources and which tables you want to transfer. When you select your tables, click on the advanced (or options) button and select the check box called "preserve primary keys". Otherwise, new primary key values will be created for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that your code &lt;strong&gt;made money&lt;/strong&gt;, for example by automating a previously manual process, adding a feature that makes more people buy your product, or fixing a bug that was making people not buy your product. Call the amount of money generated by your code "R".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, R must be greater than what you were paid to write it, "C0". Also, if your code requires modification in the future, the cost of revisions "Cn" must not exceed "R". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;profitability = R - C0 - {C1 + C2 + C3...}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code is beautiful when there is &lt;strong&gt;nothing else you can do to it&lt;/strong&gt; that will increase profitability. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the index to nonclustered, and leave it as a heap table, without a clustered index&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the index to nonclustered, but then add a surrogate key (like "id") and make it an identity, primary key, and clustered index&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either one will speed up your inserts &lt;strong&gt;without&lt;/strong&gt; noticeably slowing down your reads. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it this way -- right now, you're telling SQL to do a bulk insert, but then you're asking SQL to reorder the entire table every table you add anything. With a nonclustered index, you'll add the records in whatever order they come in, and then build a separate index indicating their desired order. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that between an algorithm in O(n) and one in O(n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), the fastest is not always the first one (though there always exists a value of n such that for problems of size &gt;n, the first algorithm is the fastest).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the hidden constant very much depends on the implementation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, in some cases, the runtime is not a deterministic function of the &lt;em&gt;size&lt;/em&gt; n of the input. Take sorting using quick sort for example: the time needed to sort an array of n elements is not a constant but depends on the starting configuration of the array. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different time complexities: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worst case (usually the simplest to figure out, though not always very meaningful)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the directory where your executable is created there will be a &lt;code&gt;BuildLog.htm&lt;/code&gt; file. Open that file in your browser and then for each section such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Creating temporary file "c:\some\path\RSP00003C.rsp" with contents
[
/D "WIN32" /D "_WINDOWS" /D "STRICT" /D "NDEBUG" ..... (lots of other switches)
.\Project.cpp
.\Another.cpp
.\AndAnother.cpp
".\And Yet Another.cpp"
]
Creating command line "cl.exe @c:\some\path\RSP00003C.rsp /nologo"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;create a .rsp file with the content between the square brackets (but not including the square brackets) and call it whatever you like. I seem to remember having problems with absolute paths so you may have to make sure all the paths are relative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in your build script add the command line from the &lt;code&gt;BuildLog.htm&lt;/code&gt; file but with your .rsp filename:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cl.exe @autobuild01.rsp /nologo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(note there will also be a link.exe section as well as cl.exe)&lt;/p&gt;

makes by far the best tablets I have ever used.  They come in a variety of prices with associated features.  If you want to be able to draw 'on-screen' they have the Cintiq, which is the most expensive, starting at $999 but definitely worth it.  For a cheaper more 'traditional' tablet there is Bambo and Intuos which start at $79, however with the Bambo and the Intuos there is quite a learning curve if your not already used to using tablets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit:
A bit of googling gave the following:
&lt;a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/patricksmacchia/archive/2008/01/05/rambling-on-the-sealed-keyword.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/patricksmacchia/archive/2008/01/05/rambling-on-the-sealed-keyword.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://codebetter.com/blogs/patricksmacchia/archive/2008/01/05/rambling-on-the-sealed-keyword.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quoting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three reasons why a sealed class is better than an unsealed class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Versioning&lt;/strong&gt;: When a class is originally sealed, it can change to unsealed in the future without breaking compatibility. ()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance&lt;/strong&gt;: () if the JIT compiler sees a call to a virtual method using a sealed types, the JIT compiler can produce more efficient code by calling the method non-virtually.()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security and Predictability&lt;/strong&gt;: A class must protect its own state and not allow itself to ever become corrupted. When a class is unsealed, a derived class can access and manipulate the base classs state if any data fields or methods that internally manipulate fields are accessible and not private.()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Another user may want to re-use your code by sub-classing your class. I don't see a reason to stop this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they want to use the functionality of my class they can achieve that with containment, and they will have much less brittle code as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example I can think of right now are customized contained classes with deep clones in .Net.  If you inherit from them you lose the deep clone ability.[I'm kind of fuzzy on this example, it's been a while since I worked with IClonable]  If you have a true singelton class, you probably don't want inherited forms of it around, and a data persistence layer is not normally place you want a lot of inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;

A better definition might be 'Representing the essential features of something without including background or inessential detail.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information hiding is the principle that users of a software component (such as a class) need to know only the essential details of how to initialize and access the component, and do not need to know the details of the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;: I seems to me that abstraction is the &lt;strong&gt;process&lt;/strong&gt; of deciding which parts of the implementation that should be &lt;strong&gt;hidden&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

I think the reasons to seal a class are few and far between.  Quite the contrary, I have been in the situation more than once where I want to extend a class, but couldn't because it was sealed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a perfect example, I was recently creating a small package (Java, not C#, but same principles) to wrap functionality around the memcached tool.  I wanted an interface so in tests I could mock away the memcached client API I was using, and also so we could switch clients if the need arose (there are 2 clients listed on the memcached homepage).  Additionally, I wanted to have the opportunity to replace the functionality altogether if the need or desire arose (such as if the memcached servers are down for some reason, we could potentially hot swap with a local cache implementation instead).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I exposed a minimal interface to interact with the client API, and it would have been awesome to extend the client API class and then just add an implements clause with my new interface.  The methods that I had in the interface that matched the actual interface would then need no further details and so I wouldn't have to explicitly implement them.  However, the class was sealed, so I had to instead proxy calls to an internal reference to this class.  The result: more work and a lot more code for no real good reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I think there are potential times when you might want to make a class sealed... and the best thing I can think of is an API that you will invoke directly, but allow clients to implement.  For example, a game where you can program against the game... if your classes were not sealed, then the players who are adding features could potentially exploit the API to their advantage.  This is a very narrow case though, and I think any time you have full control over the codebase, there really is little if any reason to make a class sealed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one reason I really like the Ruby programming language... even the core classes are open, not just to extend but to ADD AND CHANGE functionality dynamically, TO THE CLASS ITSELF!  It's called monkeypatching and can be a nightmare if abused, but it's damn fun to play with!&lt;/p&gt;

There can be semantics and relationships present that are easily broken by inheriting and overriding methods. Overriding one method at a time is an easy way to do this.  You design a class/object as a single meaningful entity and then someone comes along and thinks if a method or two were 'better' it would do no harm.  That may or may not be true.  Maybe you can correctly separate all methods between private and not private or virtual and not virtual but that still may not be enough. Demanding inheritance of all classes also puts a huge additional burden on the original developer to foresee all the ways an inheriting class could screw things up.&lt;br /&gt;

This way you can jump to the definition of a function and sub easy, which i think helps a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On separating logic from "views". VBScript supports som kind of OO with classes. I tend to write classes which do the logic which I include on the asp-page which acts as a "view". Then i hook together the view with the class like Username: &amp;lt;%= MyAccount.UserName %&gt;. The MyAccount class can also have methods like: MyAccount.Login() and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kind of primitive, but at least you can capsulate some code and hide it from the HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

Even if you're right and the other developer shouldn't have used your class to solve their problem, using a keyword isn't a great way of preventing such a mistake. Documentation is.

Treat me as (sigh) an alien that has just landed on the planet, albeit one that knows PHP and a few optimisation techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm developing a tool in &lt;strong&gt;PHP&lt;/strong&gt; that could attain quite a lot of users, if it works out right. However while I'm fully capable of developing the program I'm pretty much clueless when it comes to making something that can deal with huge traffic. So here's a few questions on it (feel free to turn this question into a resource thread as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Databases&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment I plan to use the MySQLi features in PHP5. However how should I setup the databases in relation to users and content? Do I actually &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; multiple databases? At the moment everything's jumbled into one database - although I've been considering spreading user data to one, actual content to another and finally core site content (template masters etc.) to another. My reasoning behind this is that sending queries to different databases will ease up the load on them as one database = 3 load sources. Also would this still be effective if they were all on the same server?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Caching&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a template system that is used to build the pages and swap out variables. Master templates are stored in the database and each time a template is called it's cached copy (a html document) is called. At the moment I have two types of variable in these templates - a static var and a dynamic var. Static vars are usually things like page names, the name of the site - things that don't change often; dynamic vars are things that change on each page load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question on this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say I have comments on different articles. Which is a better solution: store the simple comment template and render comments (from a DB call) each time the page is loaded or store a cached copy of the comments page as a html page - each time a comment is added/edited/deleted the page is recached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Finally&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any tips/pointers for running a high load site on PHP. I'm pretty sure it's a workable language to use - Facebook and Yahoo! give it great precedence - but are there any experiences I should watch out for?&lt;/p&gt;

If you don't have to deal with these issues right now then don't, focus on delivering something that works correctly first.  That being said, if the optimizations can't wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try profiling your database queries, figure out what's slow and what happens alot and come up with an optimization strategy from that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would investigate &lt;a href="http://es.php.net/memcache"&gt;Memcached&lt;/a&gt; as it's what a lot of the higher load sites use for efficiently caching content of all types, and the PHP object interface to it is quite nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Splitting up databases among servers and using some sort of load balancing technique (e.g. generate a random number between 1 and # redundant databases with necessary data - and use that number to determine which database server to connect to) can also be an excellent way to increase efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These have all worked out pretty well in the past for some fairly high load sites.  Hope this helps to get you started :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Cache, cache, cache. Caching is one of the simplest and most effective ways to reduce load on your webserver and database. Cache page content, queries, expensive computation, anything that is I/O bound. Memcache is dead simple and effective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use multiple servers once you are maxed out. You can have multiple web servers and multiple database servers (with replication).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce overall # of request to your webservers. This entails caching JS, CSS and images using expires headers. You can also move your static content to a CDN, which will speed up your user's experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measure &amp;amp; benchmark. Run Nagios on your production machines and load test on your dev/qa server. You need to know when your server will catch on fire so you can prevent it.&lt;/li&gt;

You really need to get a tool like &lt;a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/"&gt;jmeter&lt;/a&gt; and benchmark to see where your problem points will be. You can spend a lot of time guessing and improving, but you won't see real results until you measure and compare your changes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, for many years, the MySQL query cache was the solution to all of our performance problems. If your site was slow, MySQL experts suggested turning the query cache on. It turns out that if you have a high write load, the cache is actually crippling. If you turned it on without testing, you'd never know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And don't forget that you are never done scaling. A site that handles 10req/s will need changes to support 1000req/s. And if you're lucking enough to need to support 10,000req/s, your architecture will probably look completely different as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Databases&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't use MySQLi -- &lt;a href="http://ca.php.net/pdo"&gt;PDO&lt;/a&gt; is the 'modern' OO database access layer. The most important feature to use is placeholders in your queries. It's smart enough to use server side prepares and other optimizations for you as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You probably don't want to break your database up at this point. If you do find that one database isn't cutting, there are several techniques to scale up, depending on your app. Replicating to additional servers typically works well if you have more reads than writes. Sharding is a technique to split your data over many machines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Caching&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You probably don't want to cache in your database. The database is typically your bottleneck, so adding more IO's to it is typically a bad thing. There are several PHP caches out there that accomplish similar things like &lt;a href="http://ca.php.net/apc"&gt;APC&lt;/a&gt; and Zend. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measure your system with caching on and off. I bet your cache is heavier than serving the pages straight. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it takes a long time to build your comments and article data from the db, integrate &lt;a href="http://www.danga.com/memcached/"&gt;memcache&lt;/a&gt; into your system. You can cache the query results and store them in a memcached instance. It's important to remember that retrieving the data from memcache must be faster than assembling it from the database to see any benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your articles aren't dynamic, or you have simple dynamic changes after it's generated, consider writing out html or php to the disk. You could have an index.php page that looks on disk for the article, if it's there, it streams it to the client. If it isn't, it generates the article, writes it to the disk and sends it to the client. Deleting files from the disk would cause pages to be re-written. If a comment is added to an article, delete the cached copy -- it would be regenerated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I have read before (and agree with) that a design pattern is often a sign of missing features in the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a perfect example, the "Factory" pattern is completely unnecessary in some languages, Ruby as the example I am thinking of (because object construction is just a method on the Class instance):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# create a factory for MyObject
my_factory = MyObject
instance_1 = my_factory.new

# change the factory to another class
my_factory = MyOtherObject
instance_2 = my_factory.new
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you are applying a design pattern to a different language than it was initially developed for, make sure you consider if it is REALLY necessary, and what ways you might be able to improve it with the new language features available.  Design patterns are just a guide, you should always consider if the use you intend really needs the pattern, or if it can be adopted in a better way in your case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest change you will find migrating to SVN is the idea of "Check out" and "Check in" aren't exactly the same as "Update" and "Commit". . . thus, any IDE integration with VB6 is limited because VB6 supports MSSCCI, a check-out/check-in mechanism.  I once used TamTam SVN (&lt;a href="http://www.daveswebsite.com/software/tamtamsvn/index.shtml"&gt;http://www.daveswebsite.com/software/tamtamsvn/index.shtml&lt;/a&gt;) with Visual Studio 2003, but stopped since I found it limiting.

I'd really recommend you look those over and pick the one that appears the easiest for you, and to most closely fit the way you prefer to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of them, the most comfortable for me to work with was &lt;a href="http://wicket.apache.org/"&gt;Wicket&lt;/a&gt;, due to the lightweight nature of component building and simplicity of page templating.  That goes doubly so if you are using your own db code instead of Hibernate or some other framework (I was never completely happy with Wicket Hibernate or Spring Integration).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://echo.nextapp.com/site/"&gt;Echo&lt;/a&gt; is great if you don't mind writing all of your layout in Java.  I know that is different now, but I still think that product serves a fairly narrow niche.  They change the development model with every major release as well it seems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tapestry.apache.org/tapestry3/"&gt;Tapestry&lt;/a&gt; is a great product, but it is obviously very different from the others in terms of development model as it is led mainly by one dude.  Howard Lewis Ship is no doubt quite smart, but I am disappointed with their decision to basically forget backwards compatibility with each release.  Again, though, for your needs this may not matter, and I've always found the Tapestry products pleasurable to work against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/javaserverfaces-139869.html"&gt;JSF&lt;/a&gt; has been out for years, and still feels like something that a &lt;a href="http://struts.apache.org/"&gt;Struts&lt;/a&gt; guy built to fix all of the problems of Struts.  Without really understanding all of the problems with Struts.  It still has an unfinished feel to it, although the product is obviously very flexible.  I use it and have some fondness for it, with great hopes for its future.  I think the next release (2.0) to be delivered in JEE6 will really bring it into its own, with a new template syntax (similar to Facelets) and a simplified component model (custom components in only 1 file... finally).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, of course, there are a million smaller frameworks and tools that get their own following (&lt;a href="http://velocity.apache.org/"&gt;Velocity&lt;/a&gt; for basic needs, raw &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Pages"&gt;JSPs&lt;/a&gt;, Struts, etc).  I generally prefer component oriented frameworks myself, though.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I'd recommend just taking a look at Tapestry, Wicket, and JSF and just picking the one that feels the best to you.  You'll probably find one that just fits the way you like to work very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need to spend a lot of time browsing source code. For this, check out &lt;a href="http://lxr.linux.no/"&gt;http://lxr.linux.no/&lt;/a&gt; which is a browsable linked version of the source and makes life a lot easier.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Abstraction and encapsulation are complementary concepts: abstraction
  focuses on the observable behavior of an object... encapsulation
  focuses upon the implementation that gives rise to this behavior...
  encapsulation is most often achieved through information hiding, which
  is the process of hiding all of the secrets of object that do not
  contribute to its essential characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words: abstraction = the object externally; encapsulation (achieved through information hiding) = the object internally,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: 
In the .NET Framework, the &lt;code&gt;System.Text.StringBuilder&lt;/code&gt; class provides an abstraction over a string buffer. This buffer abstraction lets you work with the buffer without regard for its implementation. Thus, you're able to append strings to the buffer without regard for how the &lt;code&gt;StringBuilder&lt;/code&gt; internally keeps track of things such the pointer to the buffer and managing memory when the buffer gets full (which it does with encapsulation via information hiding).&lt;/p&gt;

This query will yield duplicates usually, because you will get 1 row of each object, per tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to do this in SQL would be to have three tables:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    SELECT obj 
      FROM object
     WHERE EXISTS( SELECT * 
                     FROM tags 
                    WHERE tag = 'fruit' 
                      AND oid = object_id ) 
       AND EXISTS( SELECT * 
                     FROM tags 
                    WHERE tag = 'Apple'
                      AND oid = object_id )
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also other ways you can do it, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT oid
  FROM tags
 WHERE tag = 'Apple'
INTERSECT
SELECT oid
  FROM tags
 WHERE tag = 'Fruit'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Unfortunately, it's not a hook into Explorer - so you can only use it for your own &lt;code&gt;IFileOperation&lt;/code&gt; actions. Depending on your needs, you can write a shell extension to do your own &lt;code&gt;ConfirmRename&lt;/code&gt; (or something), and branch from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, you're looking at hooking &lt;code&gt;SHFileOperation&lt;/code&gt;, I think. This would have to be done in unmanaged code, as you'll be loaded into Explorer.exe. For Vista, this has been changed to &lt;code&gt;IFileOperation&lt;/code&gt; - which probably means you'll have to hook the creation of it and pass out your mock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think since you're talking a rename, &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24644/hooking-my-program-with-windows-explorers-rename-event#24742"&gt;wilhelmtell's idea&lt;/a&gt; of confirming &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the change, and undoing it if necessary is the best idea.&lt;/p&gt;

I thought AJAX was the way to go, but Dave has &lt;a href="http://encosia.com/2007/10/03/easy-incremental-status-updates-for-long-requests/" rel="nofollow"&gt;a nice article about using Javascript&lt;/a&gt;. I integrated it into my application and it worked great on my client, but NOT my server WebHost4Life. I have another server @ Brinkster and decided to try it there and it DOES work. All the code is the same on my client, WebHost4Life, and Brinkster, so there's obviously something going on with WebHost4Life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm planning to write an email to them or request technical support, but I'd like to be proactive and try to figure out what could be going on with their end to cause this difference. I did everything I could with my code to turn off Buffering like Page.Response.BufferOutput = False. What server settings could they have implemented to cause this difference? Is there any way I could circumvent it on my own without their help? If not, what would they need to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reference, a link to the working version of a simpler version of my application is located @ &lt;a href="http://www.jasoncomedy.com/javascriptfun/javascriptfun.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jasoncomedy.com/javascriptfun/javascriptfun.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.jasoncomedy.com/javascriptfun/javascriptfun.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the same version that isn't working is located @ &lt;a href="http://www.tabroom.org/Ajaxfun/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tabroom.org/Ajaxfun/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.tabroom.org/Ajaxfun/Default.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. You'll notice in the working version, you get updates with each step, but in the one that doesn't, it sits there for a long time until everything is done and then does all the updates to the client at once ... and that makes me sad :(&lt;/p&gt;

The activity has to call out to a third party library method that itself runs another process asynchronously and may take anywhere from seconds to many hours to complete.  This library offers the ability for me to either poll for the method result or to subscribe to an event that indicates its completion.  In my non-workflow apps, I typically just subscribe to that event, but that doesn't seem to be reasonable in the workflow case.  I'm also not sure exactly how to best implement a polling scheme.  Can someone recommend some pointers to similar problems?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need something that speaks SMB/CIFS on one end, and your own code on the other. The easiest way to do that is with a userspace file system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, here's a couple of links:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.palissimo.de/index.php?c=6" rel="nofollow"&gt;WinFUSE&lt;/a&gt;, which is kind of a barebones CIFS/SMB server that can host your own filesystem. I've done a couple of small samples with it - and the docs are terrible, but it more or less worked.&lt;/li&gt;

For instance, it would not be unusual to block traffic from certain sources during a denial of service attack.  If a user fails to provide proper credentials more than 3 times the IP address is blocked or the account is locked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When ScanAlert issues hundreds of requests which may include SQL injection--to name one--it certainly matches what the site code should consider "malicious behavior".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, just putting UrlScan or eEye SecureIIS in place may deny many such requests, but is that a true test of the site code.  It's the job of the site code to detect malicious users/requests and deny them. At what layer is the test valid? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ScanAlert presents in two different ways: the number of requests which are malformed and the variety of each individual request as a test. It's seems like the 2 pieces of advice that emerge are as follows: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The site code should not try to detect malicious traffic from a particular source and block that traffic, because that is a futile effort.&lt;/li&gt;

It's well worth reading if you do any .NET development.  Based on that text, my understanding is that the value types within a reference type do live in the heap embedded in the parent object.  Reference types are &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; on the heap.
Boxing and unboxing are not symmetric. Boxing can be a bigger concern than unboxing. Boxing &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; require copying the contents of the value type from the stack to the heap.  Depending on how frequently this happens to you there may be no point in having a struct instead of a class.  If you have some performance critical code and you're not sure if boxing and unboxing is happening use a tool to examine the IL code of your method.  You'll see the words box and unbox in the IL.  Personally, I would measure the performance of my code and only then see if this is a candidate for worry.  In your case I don't think this will be such a critical issue.  You are not going to have to copy from the stack to the heap (box) every time you access this value type inside the reference type.  That scenario is where boxing becomes a more meaningful problem.&lt;/p&gt;

The thread's stack for a method only lives for the duration of a method; how can the value persist if it only exists within that stack?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A class' object size in the managed heap is the sum of its value-type fields, reference-type pointers, and additional CLR overhead variables like the Sync block index. When one assigns a value to an object's value-type field, the CLR copies the value to the space allocated within the object for that particluar field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take for example, a simple class with a single field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class EmbeddedValues
{
  public int NumberField;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with it, a simple testing class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class EmbeddedTest
{
  public void TestEmbeddedValues()
  {
    EmbeddedValues valueContainer = new EmbeddedValues();

    valueContainer.NumberField = 20;
    int publicField = valueContainer.NumberField;
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use the MSIL Disassembler provided by the .NET Framework SDK to peek at the IL code for EmbeddedTest.TestEmbeddedValues()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.method public hidebysig instance void  TestEmbeddedValues() cil managed
{
  // Code size       23 (0x17)
  .maxstack  2
  .locals init ([0] class soapextensions.EmbeddedValues valueContainer,
           [1] int32 publicField)
  IL_0000:  nop
  IL_0001:  newobj     instance void soapextensions.EmbeddedValues::.ctor()
  IL_0006:  stloc.0
  IL_0007:  ldloc.0
  IL_0008:  ldc.i4.s   20
  IL_000a:  stfld      int32 soapextensions.EmbeddedValues::NumberField
  IL_000f:  ldloc.0
  IL_0010:  ldfld      int32 soapextensions.EmbeddedValues::NumberField
  IL_0015:  stloc.1
  IL_0016:  ret
} // end of method EmbeddedTest::TestEmbeddedValues
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the CLR is being told to &lt;strong&gt;stfld&lt;/strong&gt; the loaded value of "20" in the stack to the loaded EmbeddValues' NumberField field location, directly into the managed heap. Similarly, when retrieving the value, it uses &lt;strong&gt;ldfld&lt;/strong&gt; instruction to directly copy the value out of that managed heap location into the thread stack. No box/unboxing happens with these types of operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i++ could potentially be slower than ++i, since the old value of i

compilers will optimize this away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can demonstrate this by looking at the code for this function,
both with ++i and i++.&lt;/p&gt;

extern void g(int i);
void f()

    int i;

    for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; 100; i++)
        g(i);

}

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ diff i++.c ++i.c

---
&amp;gt;     for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; 100; ++i)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

$ gcc -S i++.c ++i.c

Here is a contrived example (bear in mind my syntax will be off; my C is rusty, but this example will still illustrate the concept):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class MyClass
{
   SomeOtherClass *myObject;

   public MyClass()
   {
      //The object is created when the class is constructed
      myObject = (SomeOtherClass*)malloc(sizeof(myObject));
   }

   public ~MyClass()
   {
      //The class is destructed
      //If you don't free the object here, you leak memory
      free(myObject);
   }

   public void SomeMemberFunction()
   {
      //Some use of the object
      myObject-&amp;gt;SomeOperation();
   }


};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, I'm using an object of type SomeOtherClass during the lifetime of MyClass. The SomeOtherClass object is used in several functions, so I've dynamically allocated the memory: the SomeOtherClass object is created when MyClass is created, used several times over the life of the object, and then freed once MyClass is freed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously if this were real code, there would be no reason (aside from possibly stack memory consumption) to create myObject in this way, but this type of object creation/destruction becomes useful when you have a lot of objects, and want to finely control when they are created and destroyed (so that your application doesn't suck up 1GB of RAM for its entire lifetime, for example), and in a Windowed environment, this is pretty much mandatory, as objects that you create (buttons, say), need to exist well outside of any particular function's (or even class') scope.&lt;/p&gt;

However, if string manipulation works for you, then go for it! There are plenty of cases where small or simple XML text can be safely built by hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just be aware that creating XML text is harder than it looks. Here's some criteria I would consider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First: how much &lt;em&gt;control&lt;/em&gt; do you have on the information that goes into the xml?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The less control you have on the source data, the more likely you will have trouble, and the more advantageous the library becomes. For example: (a) Can you &lt;em&gt;guarantee&lt;/em&gt; that the element names will never have a character that is illegal in a name? (b) How about quotes in an attribute's content? Can they happen, and are you handling them? (c) Does the data ever contain anything that might need to be encoded as an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_entity" rel="nofollow"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt; (like the less-than which often needs to be output as &lt;strong&gt;&amp;amp;lt;&lt;/strong&gt;); are you doing it correctly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, maintainability: is the code that builds the XML easy to understand &lt;em&gt;by someone else&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably don't want to be stuck with the code for life. I've worked with second-hand C++ code that hand-builds XML and it can be surprisingly obscure. Of course, if this is a personal project of yours, then you don't need to worry about "others": substitute "in a year" for "others" above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't worry about performance. If your XML is simple enough that you can hand-write it, any overhead from the library is probably meaningless. Of course, your case might be different, but you should measure to prove it first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Yes; you can hand build XML text by hand if it's simple enough; but not knowing the libraries available is &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; not the right reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A modern XML library is a quite powerful tool, but it can also be daunting. However, learning the essentials of your XML library is not that hard, and it can be quite handy; among other things, it's almost a requisite in today's job marketplace. Just don't get bogged down by namespaces, schemas and other fancier features until you get the essentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

However, the part of the cloud it lives in is under our control. I would never trust a third party to do that sort of lifting for my application, because I don't have control over it. The recent Amazon S3 outage is an excellent illustration of why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I absolutely, positively, would never put any part of my infrastruture on (for example) Amazon's servers. Build servers, source code, etc, is always tightly controlled. Not only because of potential unreliability, but because I find the licenses for these services overly permissive for the service provider. Besides that, an unscrupulous host* could potentially take my source code and use it for their own purposes, even if something like that is not legalized by the license agreement I would have to accept in order to use the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For C++, the answer is a bit more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; is a simple type (not an instance of a C++ class), then the answer given for C holds, since the compiler is generating the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; is an instance of a C++ class, then &lt;code&gt;i++&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;++i&lt;/code&gt; are making calls to one of the &lt;code&gt;operator++&lt;/code&gt; functions. Here's a standard pair of these functions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Foo&amp;amp; Foo::operator++()   // called for ++i
{
    this-&amp;gt;data += 1;
    return *this;
}

Foo Foo::operator++(int ignored_dummy_value)   // called for i++
{
    Foo tmp(*this);   // variable "tmp" cannot be optimized away by the compiler
    ++(*this);
    return tmp;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the compiler isn't generating code, but just calling an &lt;code&gt;operator++&lt;/code&gt; function, there is no way to optimize away the &lt;code&gt;tmp&lt;/code&gt; variable and its associated copy constructor. If the copy constructor is expensive, then this can have a significant performance impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;char *strdup(char *src)

    char * dest;
    dest = malloc(strlen(src) + 1);
    if (dest == NULL)
        abort();
    strcpy(dest, src);
    return dest;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you call it like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;main()
{
    char *s;
    s = strdup("hello");
    printf("%s\n", s);
    s = strdup("world");
    printf("%s\n", s);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see that the program works, but you have allocated memory (via malloc) without freeing it up.  You have lost your pointer to the first memory block when you called strdup the second time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is no big deal for this small amount of memory, but consider the case:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; 1000000000; ++i)  /* billion times */
    s = strdup("hello world");    /* 11 bytes */
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have now used up 11 gig of memory (possibly more, depending on your memory manager) and if you have not crashed your process is probably running pretty slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix, you need to call free() for everything that is obtained with malloc() after you finish using it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;s = strdup("hello");
free(s);  /* now not leaking memory! */
s = strdup("world");
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Ans#1: Heap. Paraphrasing Don Box from his excellent 'Essential .Net Vol 1'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Reference Types(RT) always yield instances that are allocated on the heap. &lt;strong&gt;In contrast, value types(VT) are dependent on the context - If a local var is a VT, the CLR allocates memory on the stack. If a field in a class is a member of a VT, then the CLR allocates memory for the instance as part of the layout of the object/Type in which field is declared.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ans#2: No. Boxing would occur only when you access a struct via a Object Reference / Interface Pointer. &lt;em&gt;obInstance.VT_typedfield&lt;/em&gt; will not box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;RT variables contains the address of the object it refers to. 2 RT var can point to the same object. &lt;strong&gt;In contrast, VT variables are the instances themselves. 2 VT var cannot point to same object(struct)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ++ operator may or may not be defined as a function.  For primitive types (int, double, ...) the operators are built in, so the compiler will probably be able to optimize your code.  But in the case of an object that defines the ++ operator things are different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The operator++(int) function must create a copy.  That is because postfix ++ is expected to return a different value than what it holds:  it must hold its value in a temp variable, increment its value and return the temp.  In the case of operator++(), prefix ++, there is no need to create a copy:  the object can increment itself and then simply return itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an illustration of the point:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;struct C
{
    C&amp;amp; operator++();      // prefix
    C  operator++(int);   // postfix

private:

    int i_;
};

C&amp;amp; C::operator++()
{
    ++i_;
    return *this;   // self, no copy created
}

C C::operator++(int ignored_dummy_value)
{
    C t(*this);
    ++(*this);
    return t;   // return a copy
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time you call operator++(int) you must create a copy, and the compiler can't do anything about it.  When given the choice, use operator++();  this way you don't save a copy.  It might be significant in the case of many increments (large loop?) and/or large objects.&lt;/p&gt;

SQLSTATE: 08S01, SQLCODE: -605
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When putting the settings in a regular connection string and opening with .NET code, that is fine. I am new to BizTalk and DB2. Can anybody suggest what to look out for when this error surfaces?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24 Aug 08:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, if normal .NET code with a regular DB2 connection string is used, the connection can be made and queries submitted. What this DB2 adapter is reporting is it cannot even make a proper connection handshake, let alone submitting queries. I am unsure of what are the actual mechanisms involved to make a DB2 connection happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25 Aug 08:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/msdn/showpost.aspx?postid=1155829&amp;amp;siteid=1&amp;amp;sb=0&amp;amp;d=1&amp;amp;at=7&amp;amp;ft=11&amp;amp;tf=0&amp;amp;pageid=0" rel="nofollow"&gt;this MSDN forums posting&lt;/a&gt;, it seems to be a login issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen that and that is not the case here. If we put the user name as the Package Collection it still hits the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;26 Aug 08:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the scarcity of information regarding connecting to mainframe DB2 databases from Microsoft products, I undertook the task of inspecting raw network packets to get a clue what is going on between the .NET DB2 provider's connection (which works) and the BizTalk 2006 DB2 adapter (which bombs). I observed DB2 traffic is done using the DRDA protocol. And ultimately concluded the BizTalk adapter method fails because of what's recorded in the server's reply SECCHKRM packet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why the same credentials fails here while succeeding in the .NET provider is beyond me. Right now, what I can observe is a marked difference between each method when it comes to the sequence of packets transferred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to witness the .NET provider issue out various DRDA protocol packets within in a single TCP segment. The BizTalk adapter on the other hand, places only one protocol packet per TCP segment. I do not know why this is so. However, I at the moment think that is a red herring and the true difference causing the failure in authentication is in the DRDA data exchange. I do not know the DRDA protocol so will have to study it before I can make more sense of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18 Sep 08:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage the problem is still not solved, as getting cooperation from the DB2 DBA team and help from Microsoft have been met with many obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I do want to report is, I have observed perhaps one crucial difference between all the cases of successful connection versus the failed attempt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BizTalk DB2 adapter is underlyingly using &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft ODBC Driver for DB2&lt;/strong&gt;. The other software tests that succeed make use of &lt;strong&gt;IBM DB2 ODBC DRIVER&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;IBM DB2 ODBC DRIVER  IBMCL1&lt;/strong&gt;. The IBM driver's parameter configuration is different from Microsoft's driver. But we do not see any obviously critical difference that may lead to a failed authentication for the Microsoft driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int main() {
    char* myString = (char*)malloc(5*sizeof(char));
    myString = "abcd";
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point you've allocated 5 bytes for myString and filled it with "abcd\0" (strings end in a null - \0).
If your string allocation was&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;myString = "abcde";
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would be assigning "abcde" in the 5 bytes you've had allocated to your program, and the trailing null character would be put at the end of this - a part of memory that hasn't been allocated for your use and could be free, but could equally be being used by another application - This is the critical part of memory management, where a mistake will have unpredictable (and sometimes unrepeatable) consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(define-key global-map (kbd "C-c C-f") 'function-name)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;define-key&lt;/code&gt; is, unsurprisingly, the function to define a new key. &lt;code&gt;global-map&lt;/code&gt; is the global keymap, as opposed to individual maps for each mode. &lt;code&gt;(kbd "C-c C-f")&lt;/code&gt; returns a string representing the key sequence &lt;code&gt;C-c C-f&lt;/code&gt;. There are other ways of doing this, including inputting the string directly, but this is usually the most straightforward since it takes the normal written representation. &lt;code&gt;'function-name&lt;/code&gt; is a symbol that's the name of the function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, unless your function is already defined, you'll want to define it before you use this. To do that, write&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(defun function-name (args)
  (interactive)
  stuff
  ...)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;defun&lt;/code&gt; defines a function - use &lt;code&gt;C-h f defun&lt;/code&gt; for more specific information. The &lt;code&gt;(interactive)&lt;/code&gt; there isn't really a function call; it tells the compiler that it's okay for the function to be called by the user using &lt;code&gt;M-x function-name&lt;/code&gt; and via keybindings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, for interactive searching in particular, this is tricky; the &lt;code&gt;isearch&lt;/code&gt; module doesn't really seem to be set up for what you're trying to do. But you can use this to do something similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int  a;
char c;
char d[16];
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The variables are created in the "&lt;strong&gt;stack&lt;/strong&gt;". Stack variables are automatically freed when they go out of scope (that is, when the code can't reach them anymore). You might hear them called "automatic" variables, but that has fallen out of fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many beginner examples will use only stack variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stack is nice because it's automatic, but it also has two drawbacks: (1) The compiler needs to know in advance how big the variables are, and (b) the stack space is somewhat limited. For example: in Windows, under default settings for the Microsoft linker, the stack is set to 1 MB, and not all of it is available for your variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't know at compile time how big your array is, or if you need a big array or struct, you need "plan B".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plan B is called the "&lt;strong&gt;heap&lt;/strong&gt;". You can usually create variables as big as the Operating System will let you, but you have to do it yourself. Earlier postings showed you one way you can do it, although there are other ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int size;
// ...
// Set size to some value, based on information available at run-time. Then:
// ...
char *p = (char *)malloc(size);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note that variables in the heap are not manipulated directly, but via pointers)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you create a heap variable, the problem is that the compiler can't tell when you're done with it, so you lose the automatic releasing. That's where the "manual releasing" you were referring to comes in. Your code is now responsible to decide when the variable is not needed anymore, and release it so the memory can be taken for other purposes. For the case above, with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;free(p);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes this second option "nasty business" is that it's not always easy to know when the variable is not needed anymore. Forgetting to release a variable when you don't need it will cause your program to consume more memory that it needs to. This situation is called a "leak". The "leaked" memory cannot be used for anything until your program ends and the OS recovers all of its resources. Even nastier problems are possible if you release a heap variable by mistake &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; you are actually done with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In C and C++, you are responsible to clean up your heap variables like shown above. However, there are languages and environments such as Java and .NET languages like C# that use a different approach, where the heap gets cleaned up on its own. This second method, called "garbage collection", is much easier on the developer but you pay a penalty in overhead and performance. It's a balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I have glossed over many details to give a simpler, but hopefully more leveled answer)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that a fair assumption?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;: The reason I'm asking is that in many cases you can rewrite an SQL based on IN to use an EXISTS instead, and vice versa, and for some database engines, the query optimizer will treat the two differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE Exists (
    SELECT *
    FROM Orders
    WHERE Orders.CustomerID = Customers.ID
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;can be rewritten to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE ID IN (
    SELECT CustomerID
    FROM Orders
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or with a join:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT Customers.*
FROM Customers
    INNER JOIN Orders ON Customers.ID = Orders.CustomerID
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question still stands, is the original poster wondering about what IN and EXISTS does, and thus how to use it, or does he ask wether rewriting an SQL using IN to use EXISTS instead, or vice versa, will be a good idea?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;EXISTS&lt;/code&gt; is when you need to match the results of query with another subquery.
Query#1 results need to be retrieved where SubQuery results match. Kind of a Join..
E.g. select customers table#1 who have placed orders table#2 too&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN is to retrieve if the value of a specific column lies &lt;code&gt;IN&lt;/code&gt; a list (1,2,3,4,5)

&lt;p&gt;For use with pipes, reading from standard input as &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24931/how-to-capture-python-interpreters-andor-cmdexes-output-from-a-python-script#24939" rel="nofollow"&gt;lassevk&lt;/a&gt; suggested you'd do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import sys
x = sys.stderr.readline()
y = sys.stdin.readline()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sys.stdin and sys.stdout are standard file objects as noted above, defined in the &lt;a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-sys.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;sys&lt;/a&gt; module. You might also want to take a look at the &lt;a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-pipes.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;pipes&lt;/a&gt; module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading data with readline() as in my example is a pretty nave way of getting data though. If the output is not line-oriented or indeterministic you probably want to look into &lt;a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/poll-objects.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;polling&lt;/a&gt; which unfortunately does not work in windows, but I'm sure there's some alternative out there.&lt;/p&gt;

If you want to call a function with a parameter in the future, you need to set up some anonymous function calls. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to pass the function as an argument for it to be called later. In effect this means without brackets behind the name. The following will call the alert at once, and it will display 'Hello world':&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var a = "world";
setTimeout(alert("Hello " + a), 2000);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix this you can either put the name of a function (as Flubba has done) or you can use an anonymous function. If you need to pass a parameter, then you have to use an anonymous function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var a = "world";
setTimeout(function(){alert("Hello " + a)}, 2000);
a = "Stack Overflow";
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you run that code you will notice that after 2 seconds the popup will say 'Hello Stack Overflow'. This is because the value of the variable a has changed in those two seconds. To get it to say 'Hello world' after two seconds, you need to use the following code snippet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function callback(a){
    return function(){
     alert("Hello " + a);
    }
}
var a = "world";
setTimeout(callback(a), 2000);
a = "Stac Overflow";
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will wait 2 seconds and then popup 'Hello world'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using &lt;a href="http://office.microsoft.com/visio"&gt;Visio&lt;/a&gt;, I tend to use &lt;a href="http://softwarestencils.com/uml/index.html"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; stencils for my UMLing needs (the built in kind of suck).

&lt;p&gt;Dont forget the usefulness of online forurms such as this or aigamedev.com as I used these extensivly throughout my own AI degree. You might also find that you need to buy a specific game AI book to help with some game logic as this can be substantially different from AI  'application' logic. In game scenarios I think you're generally lucky if you get ~5-10% of the processing time whereas in an application the AI is generally the only thing running and this allows for much more advanced and processor heavy techniques. This is also something that you might need to consider and Im not entirely sure that Russel &amp;amp; Norvig is the best place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When working with collections, do will still test for obvious add/remove/inserts successful, even when based on Generics etc where we kind of "know" its going to work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some tests seem to take forever to implement.. Such as when working with string output, is there a "better" way to go about this sort of thing? (e.g. test the object model before parsing, break parsing down into small ops and test there) In my mind you should always test the "end result" but that can vary wildly and be tedious to set up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don't have a testing framework to use (work wont pay for one) so I can "practice" more. Are there any good ones that are free for commercial use? (at the moment I am using good 'ol &lt;em&gt;Debug.Assert&lt;/em&gt; :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probably the biggest.. Sometimes I don't know what to expect &lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt; to happen.. I mean, you get your green light but I am always concerned that I may be missing a test.. Do you dig deeper to try and break the code, or leave it be and wait for it all fall over later (which will cost more)..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If it is completely trivial (getters/setters etc) do not test it, unless you don't have confidence in the code for some reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it is a quite simple, but non-trivial method, test it. The test is probably easy to write anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When it comes to what to expect not to happen, I would say that if a certain potential problem is the responsibility of the class you are testing, you need to test that it handles it correctly. If it is not the current class' responsibility, don't test it.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+1 for not testing framework code, but you may still need to test classes derived from framework classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If some class/method is cumbersome to test it may be strong indication that something is wrong with desing. I try to follow "1 class - 1 responsibility, 1 method - 1 action" principle. That way you will be able to test complex methods much easier by doing that in smaller portions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+1 for xUnit. For Java you may also consider &lt;a href="http://testng.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;TestNG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TDD is not single event it is a process. So do not try to envision everything from the beginning, but make sure that every bug found in code is actually covered by test once discovered.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First step would be to gather information on everything the app needs to run; this I usually accomplish by running &lt;a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=systrace&amp;amp;sektion=1" rel="nofollow"&gt;systrace(1)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ldd&amp;amp;sektion=1" rel="nofollow"&gt;ldd(1)&lt;/a&gt; to find out what is needed to run the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go through the output of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;systrace -A -d. &amp;lt;app&amp;gt;
ldd &amp;lt;app&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and make sure that everything the app touches and needs (quite a lot of apps touch stuff it doesn't actually need) is available in the chroot environment. You might need to tweak configs and environment variables a bit. Also, if there is an option to have the app log to syslog, I usually do that and create a syslog socket (see the -a option of &lt;a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=syslogd&amp;amp;sektion=8" rel="nofollow"&gt;syslogd(8)&lt;/a&gt;) in order to decrease the places the app needs write access to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I just described is a generic way to make just about any program run in a chroot environment (however, if you need to import half the userland and some suid commands, you might want to just not do chroot :). For apps running under Apache (I'm sure you're aware that the OpenBSD &lt;a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=httpd&amp;amp;sektion=8" rel="nofollow"&gt;httpd(8)&lt;/a&gt; is slightly different) you have the option (once the program has started; any dynamic libraries still needs to be present in the jail) of using apache to access the files, allowing  the use of &lt;a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/configuring.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;httpd.conf&lt;/a&gt; to import resources in the chroot environment without actually copying them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also useful (if slightly outdated) is &lt;a href="http://www.phpbuilder.com/manual/en/install.unix.openbsd.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; link, outlining some gotchas in chrooted PHP on OpenBSD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methods cannot be genericised in the same way that a type can, so the only option for a method with a dynamically-typed generic return type -- phew that's a mouthful :-) -- is to pass in the type as an argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wouldn't make sense in this context to use the array argument as in &lt;code&gt;Collection.toArray( T[] )&lt;/code&gt;. The only reason an array is used there is because the same (pre-allocated) array is used to contain the results (if the array is large enough to fit them all in). This saves on allocating a new array at run-time all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for the purposes of education, if you did want to use the array typing, the syntax is very similar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;static &amp;lt;T&amp;gt; List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; createEmptyList( T[] array ) {

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;double red = (percent &amp;lt; 50) ? 255 : 256 - (percent - 50) * 5.12;
double green = (percent &amp;gt; 50) ? 255 : percent * 5.12;
var color = Color.FromArgb(255, (byte)red, (byte)green, 0);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Works perfectly - Only adjustment I had to make from Marius solution was to use 256, as (255 - (percent - 50) * 5.12 yield -1 when 100%, resulting in Yellow for some reason in Silverlight (-1, 255, 0) -&gt; Yellow ...&lt;/p&gt;

To check this look at the relation in opposite direction: is a Shape a generalization of Circle? If the answer is yes then it is ok to use inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you have a class for which there can not be any particular cases that specialize its behavior it should be sealed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also due to LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle) one can use derived class where base class is expected and this is actually imposes the greatest impact from use of inheritance: code using base class &lt;em&gt;may be given an inherited class and it still has to work as expected&lt;/em&gt;. In order to protect external code when there is no obvious need for subclasses you seal the class and its clients can rely that its behavior will not be changed. Otherwise external code needs to be explicitly designed to expect possible changes in behavior in subclasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more concrete example would be Singleton pattern. You need to seal singleton to ensure one can not break the "singletonness".&lt;/p&gt;

Well, as it is a list of some type that should be returned the corresponding example should look something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;static &amp;lt;T&amp;gt; List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; createEmptyList( List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; a ) {
  return new ArrayList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But yes, passing the class object is clearly the better one. My only argument is that of familiarity, and in this exact instance it isn't worth much (in fact it is bad).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If you need to do so much for your test, maybe your object/method is doing too much as well.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Just test the &lt;em&gt;correct thing that will happen&lt;/em&gt;. You don't &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to test everything that can go wrong: you have to wait for your tests to fail for that.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for creating exceptions becoming tedious, you kinda get used to it. Use of a good code generator or template can create the exception class with minimal hand editing within about 5 or 10 seconds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in many real world applications, error handling can be 70% of the work, so it's all just part of the game really. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As tgmdbm suggests, in MVC/MVP applications I let all my unhandlable exceptions bubble up to the top and get caught by the dispatcher which delegates to an ExceptionHandler. I set it up so that it uses an ExceptionResolver that looks in the config file to choose an appropriate view to show the user. Java's Spring MVC library does this very well. Here's a snippet from a config file for Spring MVC's Exception resolver - its for Java/Spring but you'll get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This takes a huge amount of exception handling out of your presenters/controllers altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reads a line of text. A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed (&lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;), a carriage return (&lt;code&gt;\r&lt;/code&gt;), or a carriage return followed immediately by a linefeed. &lt;/p&gt;

So say for instance that you have an aggregate root X which potentially has a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of child Y entities. Now, for some scenario, you only really care about a subset of these Y entities at a time (maybe you're displaying them in a paged list or whatever).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it OK to implement a repository then, so that in such scenarios it returns an &lt;em&gt;incomplete&lt;/em&gt; aggregate? Ie. an X object who'se Ys collection only contains the Y instances we're interested in and not &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of them? This could for instance cause methods on X which perform some calculation involving the Ys to not behave as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this perhaps an indication that the Y entity in question should be considered promoted to an aggregate root?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current idea (in C#) is to leverage the delayed execution of LINQ, so that my X object has an IQueryable to represent its relationship with Y. This way, I can have transparent lazy loading with filtering... But getting this to work with an ORM (Linq to Sql in my case) might be a bit tricky.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;From my understanding of this, readLine should return null the first time no input is entered other than a line termination, like '\r'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is not correct. &lt;code&gt;readLine&lt;/code&gt; will return &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; if the end of the stream is reached. That is, for example, if you are reading a file, and the file ends, or if you're reading from a socket and the socket closses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you're simply reading the console input, hitting the return key on your keyboard does not constitute an end of stream. It's simply a character that is returned (&lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;\r\n&lt;/code&gt; depending on your OS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you want to break on both the empty string and the end of line, you should do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;while (line != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !line.equals(""))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, your current program should work as expected if you pipe some file directly into it, like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;java -cp . Echo &amp;lt; test.txt

&lt;p&gt;The reason you have to memory management worth mentioning is when you have a problem / solution that requires you to create complex structures.

Typically, the first data structure you'll need to learn is some kind of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_List" rel="nofollow"&gt;list&lt;/a&gt;. Here's a single linked one, off the top of my head:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;typedef struct listelem { struct listelem *next; void *data;} listelem;

listelem * create(void * data)
{
   listelem *p = calloc(1, sizeof(listelem));
   if(p) p-&amp;gt;data = data;
   return p;
}

listelem * delete(listelem * p)
{
   listelem next = p-&amp;gt;next;
   free(p);
   return next;
}

void deleteall(listelem * p)
{
  while(p) p = delete(p);
}

void foreach(listelem * p, void (*fun)(void *data) )
{
  for( ; p != NULL; p = p-&amp;gt;next) fun(p-&amp;gt;data);
}

listelem * merge(listelem *p, listelem *q)
{
  while(p != NULL &amp;amp;&amp;amp; p-&amp;gt;next != NULL) p = p-&amp;gt;next;

    p-&amp;gt;next = q;
    return p;
  } else
    return q;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, you'd like a few other functions, but basically, this is what you need memory management for. I should point out that there are a number tricks that are possible with "manual" memory management, e.g.,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the fact that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malloc" rel="nofollow"&gt;malloc&lt;/a&gt; is guaranteed (by the language standard) to return a pointer divisible by 4,&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The MySQL Improved Extension - mysqli
  - is the flagship. It supports all features of the MySQL Server including
  Charsets, Prepared Statements and
  Stored Procedures. The driver offers a
  hybrid API: you can use a procedural
  or object-oriented programming style
  based on your preference. mysqli comes
  with PHP 5 and up. Note that the End
  of life for PHP 4 is 2008-08-08.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The PHP Data Objects (PDO) are a
  database access abstraction layer. PDO
  allows you to use the same API calls
  for various databases. PDO does not
  offer any degree of SQL abstraction.
  PDO_MYSQL is a MySQL driver for PDO.
  PDO_MYSQL comes with PHP 5. As of PHP
  5.3 MySQL developers actively contribute to it. The PDO benefit of a
  unified API comes at the price that
  MySQL specific features, for example
  multiple statements, are not fully
  supported through the unified API.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Please stop using the first MySQL
  driver for PHP ever published:
  ext/mysql. Since the introduction of
  the MySQL Improved Extension - mysqli
  - in 2004 with PHP 5 there is no reason to still use the oldest driver

I really like PDO over MySQLi. It's straight forward to me. The API is a lot closer to other languages I've programmed in. OO Database interfaces seem to work better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven't come across any specific MySQL features that weren't available through PDO. I would be surprised if I ever did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cannot just say "don't use MySQLi" as they have different goals. PDO is almost like an abstraction layer (although it is not actually) and is designed to make it easy to use multiple database products whereas MySQLi is specific to MySQL conections. It is wrong to say that PDO is the modern access layer in the context of comparing it to MySQLi because your statement implies that the progression has been mysql -&gt; mysqli -&gt; PDO which is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choice between MySQLi and PDO is simple - if you need to support multiple database products then you use PDO. If you're just using MySQL then you can choose between PDO and MySQLi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why would you choose MySQLi over PDO? See below...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24675/tactics-for-using-php-in-a-high-load-site#25011"&gt;@ross&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are correct about MySQLnd which is the newest MySQL core language level library, however it is not a replacement for MySQLi. MySQLi (as with PDO) remains the way you would interact with MySQL through your PHP code. Both of these use libmysql as the C client behind the PHP code. The problem is that libmysql is outside of the core PHP engine and that is where mysqlnd comes in i.e. it is a Native Driver which makes use of the core PHP internals to maximise efficiency, specifically where memory usage is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MySQLnd is being developed by MySQL themselves and has recently landed onto the PHP 5.3 branch which is in RC testing, ready for a release later this year. You will then be able to use MySQLnd with MySQLi...but not with PDO. This will give MySQLi &lt;a href="http://blog.ulf-wendel.de/?p=136"&gt;a performance boost&lt;/a&gt; in many areas (not all) and will make it the best choice for MySQL interaction if you do not need the abstraction like capabilities of PDO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, MySQLnd &lt;a href="http://blog.ulf-wendel.de/?p=193"&gt;is now available in PHP 5.3&lt;/a&gt; for PDO and so you can get the advantages of the performance enhancements from ND into PDO, however, PDO is still a generic database layer and so will be &lt;a href="http://blog.ulf-wendel.de/?p=191"&gt;unlikely to be able to benefit as much from the enhancements in ND as MySQLi can&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://brian.moonspot.net/2006/08/25/pdo-turbo-button/"&gt;Some useful benchmarks can be found here&lt;/a&gt; although they are from 2006. You also need to be aware of things like &lt;a href="http://netevil.org/uuid/444a6017-0548-2459-2943-44a601714d58"&gt;this option&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of considerations that need to be taken into account when deciding between MySQLi and PDO. It reality it is not going to matter until you get to rediculously high request numbers and in that case, it makes more sense to be using an extension that has been specifically designed for MySQL rather than one which abstracts things and happens to provide a MySQL driver. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not a simple matter of which is best because each has advantages and disadvantages. You need to read the links I've provided and come up with your own decision, then test it and find out. I have used PDO in past projects and it is a good extension but my choice for pure performance would be MySQLi with the new MySQLND option compiled (when PHP 5.3 is released).&lt;/p&gt;

They had me set up with everything needed and gave me an introduction into what the project actually was (basic stuff like what the requirements were etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first we got to do minor tasks like researching things that mattered to the project (they had given us a list of topics). This was, I think, to see how much we could handle ourselves, as the things we needed to look up and research were not that trivial and it took a good 2 weeks or so (counting the basic demos we had to create for it). That testing phase was actually done really without much 'coaching'.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after that period we could work on the actual project itself. This was also the moment we began to be coached together, in a similar style to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming"&gt;pair programming&lt;/a&gt;, except there were three of us (2 interns and 1 'coach').&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learned a lot from him, but it was in an informal manner, and he didn't act like the 'all-knowing-listen-to-me' guy. When we had suggestions he would listen and think through with us whether they were any good. or give his view on why an idea should not be done in that way... Now that I think of it, he actively encouraged us to make suggestions, and to think about better ways to do things, instead of just sitting there 'taking orders' from someone who probably knows what to do better then you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in short:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let the junior programmer work (mostly) on his own to study the materials at hand, give him a list of minor TODO things like looking up information, or building small demos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the work he has done regularly and advise him if there are better ways to do things. Also point out the items he actually did well, that way he'll remember those for later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let him work on a real project, and mentor him by working together at the same project, giving him advice when he has questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The effort has to come from both directions: encourage him to ask questions, to challenge 'the way it is currently done'. Ask him questions on how he thinks it should be done and give him your opinion as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it 'enjoyable' - don't let it look like you are giving orders.&lt;/li&gt;

A quick test with VC shows that it, at least, can do that in certain cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following example, the code generated is identical for prefix and postfix, for instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;

class Foo
{
public:

 Foo() { myData=0; }
 Foo(const Foo &amp;amp;rhs) { myData=rhs.myData; }

 const Foo operator++(int)
 {
  Foo tmp(*this);
  this-&amp;gt;myData++;
  return tmp;
 }

 int GetData() { return myData; }

private:

 int myData;
};

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
 Foo testFoo;

 int count;
 printf("Enter loop count: ");
 scanf("%d", &amp;amp;count);

 for(int i=0; i&amp;lt;count; i++)
 {
  testFoo++;
 }

 printf("Value: %d\n", testFoo.GetData());
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you do ++testFoo or testFoo++, you'll still get the same resulting code. In fact, without reading the count in from the user, the optimizer got the whole thing down to a constant. So this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for(int i=0; i&amp;lt;10; i++)
{
 testFoo++;
}

printf("Value: %d\n", testFoo.GetData());
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resulted in the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;00401000  push        0Ah  
00401002  push        offset string "Value: %d\n" (402104h) 
00401007  call        dword ptr [__imp__printf (4020A0h)]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while it's certainly the case that the postfix version could be slower, it may well be that the optimizer will be good enough to get rid of the temporary copy if you're not using it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;First step would be to gather information on everything the app needs to run; this I usually accomplish by running systrace(1) and ldd(1) to find out what is needed to run the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll give this a try. The big issue I've found with xinc is that while it is a PHP application, it wants to know application installation paths (yet it still spreads stuff into other folders) and runs some PHP scripts in daemon mode (those scripts being the hardest to get running). So, for example, I told it to install to /var/www/xinc and then made a symlink of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/var/www/var/www/xinc -&gt; /var/www/xinc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and it partially worked. I got the GUI to come up bit it refused to recognize any projects that I had set up. I think the biggest problem is that part of it is running a chroot and the other half is running outside. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all else fails I'm going to just have to build something as we program inside chrooted environments since our production is chrooted. We've run into issues where we code outside of a chroot and then have to back track to find what we need to make it work inside a chroot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The title and first half of your question are philosophical/theoretical. I think the reason for accessing entities only through their "aggregate root" is to abstract away the kinds of implementation details you're describing. Access through the aggregate root is a way to reduce complexity by having a trusted point of access. You're eliminating friction/ambiguity/uncertainty by adhering to a convention. It doesn't matter how it's implemented within the root, you just know that when you ask for an entity it will be there. I don't think this perspective rules out a "filtered repository" as you describe. But to provide a &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2003/10/02/50420.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;pit of success&lt;/a&gt; for devs to fall into, it should be impossible instantiate the repository without being explicit about its "filteredness;" likewise, if shared access to a  repository instance is possible, the "filteredness" should be explicit when coding in the caller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second half of your question is about implementation on a specific platform. Not sure why you mention delayed execution, I think that's really orthogonal to the filtering question. The filtering itself could be a bit tricky to implement with LINQ. Maybe rather than inlining the Where lambdas, you set up a collection of them and select one depending on the filter you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For streaming data, the entire parser would look something like an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern" rel="nofollow"&gt;adapter&lt;/a&gt;, adapting from a stream object to an object stream (which usually is just a queue).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your example there would probably be one builder for the complete data structure (from head to EOF) which internally uses builders for the internal data elements (fed by the interpreter). Once the EOF is encountered an object would be emitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, objects created in a switch statement in some factory function is probably the simplest way for many lesser tasks. Also, I like keeping my data-objects immutable as you never know when someone shoves concurrency down your throat :)&lt;/p&gt;

I'd really like to learn about SO folks model checking experience and thoughts on the subject.

&lt;p&gt;When no parsing is supposed to happen, I usually just escape the data to not interfere with the database when I store it, and escape everything I read up from the database to not interfere with html when I display it (cgi.escape() in python).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chances are, if someone tried to input html characters or stuff, they actually wanted that to be displayed as text anyway. If they didn't, well tough :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short always escape what can affect the current target for the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I did need some parsing (markup or whatever) I usually tried to keep that language in a non-intersecting set with html so I could still just store it suitably escaped (after validating for syntax errors) and parse it to html when displaying without having to worry about the data the user put in there interfering with your html.&lt;/p&gt;

Both drives of the RAID1 and one drive of the RAID5 were inaccessible. Incredibly, the VMware hypervisor continued to run for three days from memory with no access to its host disk, keeping the VMs it managed alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At step 3 above we diagnosed the hardware problem and replaced the RAID controller, cables, and backplane. After restart, we re-initialized the RAID by instructing the controller to query the drives for their configurations. Both were degraded and both were repaired successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At step 4, it was not necessary to reinstall ESX; although, at bootup, it did not want to register the VMs. We had to dig up some buried management stuff to instruct the kernel to resignature the VMs. (Search VM docs for "resignature.")&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that our fallback plan would have worked, the VMware Converter images of the VMs that were running "orphaned" were tested and ran fine with no data loss. I highly recommend performing a VMware Converter imaging of any VM that gets into this state, after shutting down as many services as possible and getting the VM into as read-only a state as possible. Loading a vmdk either elsewhere or on the original host as a repair is usually going to be WAY faster than rebuilding a server from the ground up with backups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both libraries allow to accomplish the tasks mentioned above but in both cases I'm not really happy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AnaSys uses a internal XML representation for all SWIFT messages which you need to know in order to access the fields of a message. And you need to operate on the DOM of the XML representation, there is no way to say "get the contents of field '50K' of the SWIFT message".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Datamation library seems to have the nicer API but does not find all errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time-complexity of the best algorithms is in O(M(n)log(n)), where M(n) is the time-complexity for the multiplication of two n-bit integers (M(n)=O(n log(n) log(log(n))) using FFT-based algorithms, which are usually needed when computing digits of \pi, and such an algorithm is implemented in GMP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that even though the mathematics behind the algorithms might not be trivial, the algorithms themselves are usually a few lines of pseudo-code, and their implementation is usually very straightforward (if you chose not to write your own multiprecision arithmetic :-) ). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(there are some issues with Stack Overflow's markup and the Underscore, but it's easy to follow the code).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have actually removed that override some time ago when I saw that it wasn't working. I'll add it again now and test. Basically I want to replace the Label with some new label called: IWillNotAutoSizeLabel ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I basically hate the autosize property "on by default".&lt;/p&gt;

Just don't get discouraged and quit, you will need to give it some time.  It is a major paradigm shift in how we think about solving a problem in code.  I like to think of it like when we switched from procedural to object oriented programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I feel that test driven development is first and foremost a design activity that is used to flesh out the design of a component by creating a test that first describes the API it is going to expose and how you are going to consume it's functionality. The test will help shape and mold the System Under Test until you have been able to encapsulate enough functionality to satisfy whatever tasks you happen to be working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking the above paragraph in mind, let's look at your questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I am using a collection in my system under test, then I will setup an expectation to make sure that the code was called to insert the item and then assert the count of the collection.  I don't necessarily test the Add method on my internal list.  I just make sure it was called when the method that adds the item is called.  I do this by adding a mocking framework into the mix, with my testing framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing strings as output can be tedious.  You cannot account for every outcome.  You can only test what you expect based on the functionality of the system under test.  You should always break your tests down to the smallest element that it is testing.  Which means you will have a lot of tests, but tests that are small and fast and only test what they should, nothing else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a lot of open source testing frameworks to choose from.  I am not going to argue which is best.  Just find one you like and start using it.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mbunit.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;MbUnit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nunit.org/index.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;nUnit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.codeplex.com/xunit" rel="nofollow"&gt;xUnit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All you can do is setup your tests to account for what you want to happen.  If a scenario comes up that introduces a bug in your functionality, at least you have a test around the functionality to add that scenario into the test and then change your functionality until the test passes.  One way to find where we may have missed a test is to use &lt;a href="http://www.ncover.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;code coverage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I introduced you to the mocking term in the answer for question one.  When you introduce mocking into your arsenal for TDD, it dramatically makes testing easier to abstract away the parts that are not part of the system under test.  Here are some resources on the mocking frameworks out there are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/moq/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Moq&lt;/a&gt;: Open Source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;RhinoMocks&lt;/a&gt;: Open Source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.typemock.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;TypeMock&lt;/a&gt;: Commercial Product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://nsubstitute.github.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;NSubstitute&lt;/a&gt;: Open Source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to help in using TDD, besides reading about the process, is to watch people do it.  I recommend in watching the screen casts by JP Boodhoo on &lt;a href="http://www.dnrtv.com/archives.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;DNRTV&lt;/a&gt;.  Check these out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, these will help you see how the terms I introduced are used.  It will also introduce another tool called &lt;a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Resharper&lt;/a&gt; and how it can facilitate the TDD process.  I couldn't recommend this tool enough when doing TDD.  Seems like you are learning the process and you are just finding some of the problems that have already been solved with using other tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I would be doing an injustice to the community, if I didn't update this by adding Kent Beck's new series on &lt;a href="http://www.pragprog.com/screencasts/v-kbtdd/test-driven-development" rel="nofollow"&gt;Test Driven Development on Pragmatic Programmer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This felt better than the usual "run a script to setup my test db, then after the tests run do a cleanup of the junk/test data".  This also felt closer to unit testing because these tests could be run alone w/out having a great deal of "everything in the db needs to be 'just so' before I run these tests".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is a snippet of the abstract base class used for data access&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Public MustInherit Class Repository(Of T As Class)
    Implements IRepository(Of T)

    Private mConnectionString As String = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings("Northwind.ConnectionString").ConnectionString
    Private mConnection As IDbConnection

    Public Sub New()
        mConnection = Nothing

    End Sub

    Public Sub New(ByVal connection As IDbConnection, ByVal transaction As IDbTransaction)
        mConnection = connection
        mTransaction = transaction
    End Sub

    Public MustOverride Function BuildEntity(ByVal cmd As SqlCommand) As List(Of T)

    Public Function ExecuteReader(ByVal Parameter As Parameter) As List(Of T) Implements IRepository(Of T).ExecuteReader
        Dim entityList As List(Of T)
        If Not mConnection Is Nothing Then
            Using cmd As SqlCommand = mConnection.CreateCommand()
                cmd.Transaction = mTransaction
                cmd.CommandType = Parameter.Type
                cmd.CommandText = Parameter.Text
                If Not Parameter.Items Is Nothing Then
                    For Each param As SqlParameter In Parameter.Items
                        cmd.Parameters.Add(param)
                    Next
                End If

                    cmd.CommandType = Parameter.Type

                            cmd.Parameters.Add(param)
                        Next
                    End If
                    conn.Open()
                    entityList = BuildEntity(cmd)
                    If Not entityList Is Nothing Then
                        Return entityList
                    End If
                End Using
            End Using
        End If

        Return Nothing
    End Function
End Class
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;next you will see a sample data access class using the above base to get a list of products&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Public Class ProductRepository
    Inherits Repository(Of Product)
    Implements IProductRepository

    Private mCache As IHttpCache

    'This const is what you will use in your app
    Public Sub New(ByVal cache As IHttpCache)
        MyBase.New()
        mCache = cache
    End Sub

    'This const is only used for testing so we can inject a connectin/transaction and have them roll'd back after the test
    Public Sub New(ByVal cache As IHttpCache, ByVal connection As IDbConnection, ByVal transaction As IDbTransaction)
        MyBase.New(connection, transaction)
        mCache = cache
    End Sub

    Public Function GetProducts() As System.Collections.Generic.List(Of Product) Implements IProductRepository.GetProducts
        Dim Parameter As New Parameter()
        Parameter.Type = CommandType.StoredProcedure
        Parameter.Text = "spGetProducts"
        Dim productList As List(Of Product)
        productList = MyBase.ExecuteReader(Parameter)
        Return productList
    End Function

    'This function is used in each class that inherits from the base data access class so we can keep all the boring left-right mapping code in 1 place per object
    Public Overrides Function BuildEntity(ByVal cmd As System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand) As System.Collections.Generic.List(Of Product)
        Dim productList As New List(Of Product)
        Using reader As SqlDataReader = cmd.ExecuteReader()
            Dim product As Product
            While reader.Read()
                product = New Product()
                product.ID = reader("ProductID")
                product.SupplierID = reader("SupplierID")
                product.CategoryID = reader("CategoryID")
                product.ProductName = reader("ProductName")
                product.QuantityPerUnit = reader("QuantityPerUnit")
                product.UnitPrice = reader("UnitPrice")
                product.UnitsInStock = reader("UnitsInStock")
                product.UnitsOnOrder = reader("UnitsOnOrder")
                product.ReorderLevel = reader("ReorderLevel")
                productList.Add(product)
            End While
            If productList.Count &amp;gt; 0 Then
                Return productList
            End If
        End Using
        Return Nothing
    End Function
End Class
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And now in your unit test you can also inherit from a very simple base class that does your setup / rollback work - or keep this on a per unit test basis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;below is the simple testing base class I used&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Imports System.Configuration
Imports System.Data
Imports System.Data.SqlClient
Imports Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting

Public MustInherit Class TransactionFixture
    Protected mConnection As IDbConnection
    Protected mTransaction As IDbTransaction
    Private mConnectionString As String = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings("Northwind.ConnectionString").ConnectionString

    &amp;lt;TestInitialize()&amp;gt; _
    Public Sub CreateConnectionAndBeginTran()
        mConnection = New SqlConnection(mConnectionString)
        mConnection.Open()
        mTransaction = mConnection.BeginTransaction()
    End Sub

    &amp;lt;TestCleanup()&amp;gt; _
    Public Sub RollbackTranAndCloseConnection()
        mTransaction.Rollback()
        mTransaction.Dispose()
        mConnection.Close()
        mConnection.Dispose()
    End Sub
End Class
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and finally - the below is a simple test using that test base class that shows how to test the entire CRUD cycle to make sure all the sprocs do their job and that your ado.net code does the left-right mapping correctly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I know this doesn't test the "spGetProducts" sproc used in the above data access sample, but you should see the power behind this approach to unit testing sprocs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        Assert.AreEqual(Nothing, Product4)
    End Sub

End Class
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this is a long example, but it helped to have a reusable class for the data access work, and yet another reusable class for my testing so I didn't have to do the setup/teardown work over and over again ;)&lt;/p&gt;

However might I suggest reducing 'if' statements to readable english wherever possible by using well-named boolean vars.For example, and this is using boolean operators but you could equally use bitwise and name the bools appropriately:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;bool onlyAIsTrue = (a &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !b); // you could use bitwise XOR here
bool onlyBIsTrue = (b &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !a); // and not need this second line
if (onlyAIsTrue || onlyBIsTrue)
{
 .. stuff ..
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might think that using a boolean seems unnecessary, but it helps with two main things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your code is easier to understand because the intermediate boolean for the 'if' condition makes the intention of the condition more explicit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are using non-standard or unexpected code, such as bitwise operators on boolean values, people can much more easily see why you've done this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: You didnt explicitly say you wanted the conditionals for 'if' statements (although this seems most likely), that was my assumption. But my suggestion of an intermediate boolean value still stands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common to these is that there is a single way of determining the set of current fields. You'd simply select all entries with the active user and a NULL 'Valid-To' or 'deprecation date' or a true 'active'.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Id="25249" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="25238" CreationDate="2008-08-24T18:12:21.007" Score="87" Body="&lt;p&gt;I am using the following one: &lt;a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~peterned/examples/csslayout1.html"&gt;CSS Layout - 100 % height&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Min-height&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The #container element of this page has a min-height of 100%. That
  way, if the content requires more height than the viewport provides,
  the height of #content forces #container to become longer as well.
  Possible columns in #content can then be visualised with a background
  image on #container; divs are not table cells, and you don't need (or
  want) the fysical elements to create such a visual effect. If you're
  not yet convinced; think wobbly lines and gradients instead of
  straight lines and simple color schemes. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relative positioning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Because #container has a relative position, #footer will always remain
  at its bottom; since the min-height mentioned above does not prevent
  #container from scaling, this will work even if (or rather especially when) #content forces #container to become longer. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Padding-bottom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Since it is no longer in the normal flow, padding-bottom of #content
  now provides the space for the absolute #footer. This padding is
  included in the scrolled height by default, so that the footer will
  never overlap the above content.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Scale the text size a bit or resize your browser window to test this
  layout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;html,body {
    margin:0;
    padding:0;
    height:100%; /* needed for container min-height */
    background:gray;

h1 {

    margin:0 0 0.5em;
}
    h1, h2, a {
        color:orange;
    }

p { 
    line-height:1.5; 
    margin:0 0 1em;
}

div#container {
    position:relative; /* needed for footer positioning*/
    margin:0 auto; /* center, not in IE5 */
    width:750px;
    background:#f0f0f0;

    height:auto !important; /* real browsers */
    height:100%; /* IE6: treaded as min-height*/

    min-height:100%; /* real browsers */
}

div#header {
    padding:1em;
    background:#ddd url("../csslayout.gif") 98% 10px no-repeat;
    border-bottom:6px double gray;
}
    div#header p {
        font-style:italic;
        font-size:1.1em;
        margin:0;
    }

div#content {
    padding:1em 1em 5em; /* bottom padding for footer */
}
    div#content p {
        text-align:justify;
        padding:0 1em;
    }

div#footer {
    position:absolute;
    width:100%;
    bottom:0; /* stick to bottom */
    background:#ddd;
    border-top:6px double gray;
}
div#footer p {
    padding:1em;
    margin:0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Works fine for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although these tools were fun to use, I think they really shine when you combine them with something that dynamically enforces constraints on your program (so that it's a bit easier to verify 'useful' things about your program). We ended up taking the &lt;a href="http://www.springframework.org/webflow" rel="nofollow"&gt;Spring WebFlow framework&lt;/a&gt;, which uses XML to write a state-machine like file that specifies which web pages can transition to which other ones, and using SMV to be able to perform verification on said applications (&lt;a href="http://cs.ucsb.edu/~cgb/mvcVerification.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;shameless plug here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer your last question, I think model checking is definitely useful to have, but I lean more towards using unit testing as a technique that makes me feel comfortable about delivering my final product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can either use SIG_BLOCK to block the signals in the set list, or SIG_UNBLOCK to unblock them.  Neither of these changes the signals that aren't set in the list.  SIG_SETMASK blocks the signals in the list, and unblocks the ones that aren't set in the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, assume that the old blocking list was {SIGSEGV, SIGSUSP} and you call sigprocmask with these arguments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sigset_t x;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not just use the built in hash functions in your specific language? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we should know how hash tables work and be able to implement them. This may not seem like a super important topic, but knowing how one of the most used data structures works seems pretty important to me. If this is to become the wikipedia of programming, then these are some of the types of questions that I will come here for. I'm not looking for a CS book to be written here. I could go pull Intro to Algorithms off the shelf and read up on the chapter on hash tables and get that type of info. More specifically what I am looking for are &lt;strong&gt;code examples&lt;/strong&gt;. Not only for me in particular, but also for others who would maybe one day be searching for similar info and stumble across this page. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be more specific: If you &lt;strong&gt;had&lt;/strong&gt; to implement them, and could not use built-in functions, how would you do it? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't need to put the code here. Put it in pastebin and just link it. &lt;/p&gt;

vision_searcher.find(pitchfork, haystack)
brute_force_searcher.find(money, wallet)

Here is a quick example of a linked list that inserts a new link at the beginning of the list, deletes from the beginning of the list and loops through the list to print the links contained in it. &lt;strong&gt;Enhancements&lt;/strong&gt; to this implementation include making it a &lt;strong&gt;double-linked list&lt;/strong&gt;, adding methods to &lt;strong&gt;insert&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;delete&lt;/strong&gt; from the middle or end, and by adding &lt;strong&gt;get&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;sort&lt;/strong&gt; methods as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: In the example, the Link object doesn't actually contain another Link object -  &lt;em&gt;nextLink&lt;/em&gt; is actually only a reference to another link. &lt;/p&gt;

We use old-school XML Web Services &lt;em&gt;internally&lt;/em&gt; for communicating between a server farm and several distributed &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; local clients. No third parties involved, only our own applications used by ourselves and our customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're currently pondering moving from XML WS to a WCF/object-based model and have been experimenting with various approaches. One of them involves transferring the domain objects/aggregates directly over the wire, possibly invoking DataContract attributes on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using IExtensibleDataObject and a DataContract using the Order property on the DataMembers, we should be able to cope with simple property versioning issues (remember, we controll all clients and can easily force-update them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet I keep hearing that we should use dedicated, transfer-only Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) over the wire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Is there really still a reason to do so? We use the same domain model on the server side and client side, of course prefilling collections etc. only when deemed right and "neccessary". Collection properties generally utilize the service locator principle and IoC to invoke either an Nhibernate-based "service" to fetch data directly (on the server side), and a WCF "service" client on the client side to talk to the WCF server farm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So - why do we need to use DTOs?&lt;/p&gt;

Boxed values are typically stored as pointers to objects on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_memory_allocation"&gt;the heap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, boxed values use more memory and take at minimum two memory lookups to access: once to get the pointer, and another to follow that pointer to the primitive.  Obviously this isn't the kind of thing you want in your inner loops.  On the other hand, boxed values typically play better with other types in the system.  Since they are first-class data structures in the language, they have the expected metadata and structure that other data structures have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Java and Haskell generic collections can't contain unboxed values.  Generic collections in .NET can hold unboxed values with no penalties.  Where Java's generics are only used for compile-time type checking, .NET will &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f4a6ta2h.aspx"&gt;generate specific classes for each generic type instantiated at run time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java and Haskell have unboxed arrays, but they're distinctly less convenient than the other collections.  However, when peak performance is needed it's worth a little inconvenience to avoid the overhead of boxing and unboxing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* For this discussion, a primitive value is any that can be stored on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack"&gt;the call stack&lt;/a&gt;, rather than stored as a pointer to a value on the heap.  Frequently that's just the machine types (ints, floats, etc), structs, and sometimes static sized arrays.  .NET-land calls them value types (as opposed to reference types).  Java folks call them primitive types.  Haskellions just call them unboxed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** I'm also focusing on Java, Haskell, and C# in this answer, because that's what I know.  For what it's worth, Python, Ruby, and Javascript all have exclusively boxed values.  This is also known as the "Everything is an object" approach***. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*** Caveat: A sufficiently advanced compiler / JIT can in some cases actually detect that a value which is semantically boxed when looking at the source, can safely be an unboxed value at runtime. In essence, thanks to brilliant language implementors your boxes are sometimes free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passion&lt;/strong&gt;: The mentor loved the field he was in, the problems he was solving, and the technologies he was using. When I came under his wing, I found this to be infectious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharp and Articulate&lt;/strong&gt;: The mentor approached issues critically and framed them concisely. There wasn't a lot of fuzziness in our discussions; we got to the root of the matter and he directed me on wise courses of problem solving and action.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When implementing a needle search of a
  haystack in an object-oriented way,
  you essentially have three

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;needle.find(haystack)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/ol&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Which do you prefer, and why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Correct me if I'm wrong, but in all three examples you already &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; a reference to the needle you're looking for, so isn't this kinda like looking for your glasses when they're sitting on your nose? :p&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pun aside, I think it really depends on what you consider the responsibility of the haystack to be within the given domain. Do we just care about it in the sense of being a thing which contains needles (a collection, essentially)? Then haystack.find(needlePredicate) is fine. Otherwise, farmBoy.find(predicate, haystack) might be more appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't find any information about building flash projects in a way that lets the coder do their thing AND gives the designer freedom as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Version control is a must (as always) but can be difficult to explain to designers&lt;/li&gt;

It works by hashing a value and converting that value to an offset in an array.  The concept of a hash table is fairly easy to understand, but implementing is obviously harder.  I'm not pasting the whole hash table here, but here are some snippets of a hash table I made in C a few weeks ago...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the basics of creating a hash table is having a good hash function.  I used the djb2 hash function in my hash table:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int ComputeHash(char* key)
{
    int hash = 5381;
    while (*key)
    hash = ((hash &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 5) + hash) + *(key++);
    return hash % hashTable.totalBuckets;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then comes the actual code itself for creating and managing the buckets in the table&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;typedef struct HashTable{
    HashTable* nextEntry;
    char*      key;
    char*      value;
}HashBucket;

typedef struct HashTableEntry{
    int totalBuckets;       // Total number of buckets allocated for the hash table
    HashTable** hashBucketArray; // Pointer to array of buckets
}HashTableEntry;
HashTableEntry hashTable;

bool InitHashTable(int totalBuckets)
{
    if(totalBuckets &amp;gt; 0)
    {
        hashTable.totalBuckets = totalBuckets;
        hashTable.hashBucketArray = (HashTable**)malloc(totalBuckets * sizeof(HashTable));
        if(hashTable.hashBucketArray != NULL)
        {
            memset(hashTable.hashBucketArray, 0, sizeof(HashTable) * totalBuckets);
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

bool AddNode(char* key, char* value)
{
    int offset = ComputeHash(key);
    if(hashTable.hashBucketArray[offset] == NULL)
    {
        hashTable.hashBucketArray[offset] = NewNode(key, value);
        if(hashTable.hashBucketArray[offset] != NULL)
            return true;
    }

    else
    {
        if(AppendLinkedNode(hashTable.hashBucketArray[offset], key, value) != NULL)
            return true;
    }
    return false;
}

HashTable* NewNode(char* key, char* value)
{
    HashTable* tmpNode = (HashTable*)malloc(sizeof(HashTable));
    if(tmpNode != NULL)
    {
        tmpNode-&amp;gt;nextEntry = NULL;
        tmpNode-&amp;gt;key   = (char*)malloc(strlen(key));
        tmpNode-&amp;gt;value = (char*)malloc(strlen(value));

        strcpy(tmpNode-&amp;gt;key, key);
        strcpy(tmpNode-&amp;gt;value, value);
    }
    return tmpNode;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AppendLinkedNode finds the last node in the linked list and appends a new node to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code would be used like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if(InitHashTable(100) == false) return -1;
AddNode("10", "TEN");
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding a node is a simple as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;HashTable* FindNode(char* key)
{
    int offset = ComputeHash(key);
    HashTable* tmpNode = hashTable.hashBucketArray[offset];
    while(tmpNode != NULL)
    {
        if(strcmp(tmpNode-&amp;gt;key, key) == 0)
            return tmpNode;
        tmpNode = tmpNode-&amp;gt;nextEntry;
    }
    return NULL;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And is used as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;char* value = FindNode("10");
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have recently started reading &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0596007124"&gt;Head First Design Patterns&lt;/a&gt; and it is excellent. Certainly much easier to read, and it is very engaging. Much better for learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, get Head First Design Patterns, read that. It should give you a good understanding of the various patterns etc. Then, if you want to, get the GOF book for a reference (there is a strong overlap of patterns).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and as an aside, Heads First is all Java based, while the GOF book is (I think) more in C++ and Smalltalk (but the patterns are language agnostic, so that doesn't really matter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;TDD does NOT mean writing twice the amount of code. Test code is typically fairly quick and painless to write and is a key part of your design process and critically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;TDD helps you to realize when to stop coding! Your tests give you confidence that you've done enough for now and can stop tweaking and move on to the next thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tests and the code work together to achieve better code. Your code could be bad / buggy. Your TEST could be bad / buggy. In TDD you are banking on the chances of BOTH being bad / buggy being fairly low. Often its the test that needs fixing but that's still a good outcome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;TDD helps with coding constipation. You know that feeling that you have so much to do you barely know where to start? It's Friday afternoon, if you just procrastinate for a couple more hours... TDD allows you to flesh out very quickly what you think you need to do, and gets your coding moving quickly. Also, like lab rats, I think we all respond to that big green light and work harder to see it again!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, these designer types can SEE what they're working on. They can wander off for a juice / cigarette / iphone break and return to a monitor that immediately gives them a visual cue as to where they got to. TDD gives us something similar. It's easier to see where we got to when life intervenes...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it was Fowler who said: "Imperfect tests, run frequently, are much better than perfect tests that are never written at all". I interprete this as giving me permission to write tests where I think they'll be most useful even if the rest of my code coverage is woefully incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;TDD helps in all kinds of surprising ways down the line. Good unit tests can help document what something is supposed to do, they can help you migrate code from one project to another and give you an unwarranted feeling of superiority over your non-testing colleagues :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;: are lambda expressions useful for anything other than querying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lamba expressions are nothing much other than a convenient way of writing a function 'in-line'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they're useful any place you wanted a bit of code which can be called as though it's a separate function but which is actually written inside its caller.  (In addition to keeping related code in the same location in a file, this also allows you to play fun games with variable scoping - see 'closures' for a reference.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of a non-query-related use of a lamba might be a bit of code which does something asynchronously that you start with ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem.  The important point is that you could also write this using anonymous delegates (which were a C#2 introduction), or just a plain separate class member function.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;At what point did you insert your login/password? Did you have a look at the tables that where created? Althought your password must be encrypted, maybe it's worth just checking if your user was actually created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forms Authentication does not require any form of user database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve, can you please paste in your forms authentication web.config section, also any relevant code to the ASP.NET Login control you were using.&lt;/p&gt;

The host is Shared Intellect and they support v3.5 of the framework.  However, I am uncertain to whether they have SP1 installed.  My suspicion is that they do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a simple "News" table that has the following structure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;NewsID          uniqueidentifier
Title           nvarchar(250)
Introduction    nvarchar(1000)
Article         ntext
DateEntered     datetime (default getdate())
IsPublic        bit (default true)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal is to display the 3 most recent records from this table.  I initially went the D&amp;amp;D method (I know, I know) and created a linq datasource and was unable to find a way to limit the results the way I desired, so I removed that and wrote the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    var dc = new NewsDataContext();
    var news = from a in dc.News
               where a.IsPublic == true
               orderby a.DateEntered descending
               select new { a.NewsID, a.Introduction };

    lstNews.DataSource = news.Take(3);
    lstNews.DataBind();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This worked perfectly on my local machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when I uploaded everything to the shared host, I recieved the following error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;.Read_&amp;lt;&gt;f__AnonymousType0&lt;code&gt;2

  .Read_&amp;lt;&gt;f__AnonymousType0&lt;code&gt;2(System.Data.Linq.SqlClient.Implementation.ObjectMaterializer&lt;/code&gt;1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to research the error on Google, but met with no success. I then tried to modify my query in every way I could imagine, removing various combinations of the where/orderby parameters as well as limiting my query to a single column and even removing the "Take" command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Question therefore comes in 3 parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has anyone else encountered this and if so, is there a "quick" fix?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a way to use the datasource to limit the rows?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there some way to determine what version of the framework the shared host is running short of emailing them directly (which I have done and am awaiting an answer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance for the help and please let me know if I need to provide more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a never-ending nightmare. Every minor layout change feels like a hack. Solutions to problems seem to often involve jiggering numbers around like some chef trying to work out exactly how much nutmeg to put in his soon-to-be famous rice pudding. Then comes the multiple browser issue, the multiple resolution issues..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.. to cut a long story short, it's a pain. A PITA, if you will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many frameworks seek to abstract away from HTML (custom tags, JSFs component system) in an effort to make dealing with that particular kettle of fish easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there anything you folks have used that has a similar concept applied to CSS? Something that does a bunch of cross-browser magic for you, supports like variables (why do I have to type #3c5c8d every time I want that colour), supports caclulated fields (which are 'compiled' into CSS and JS), etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, am I even thinking about this correctly? Am I trying to push a very square block through a very round hole? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've personally tried drop-down menus for the hour, minute, and second fields (and sometimes an "AM/PM" field, as well).  I've also tried several clock-like input devices, most of which are too hard to use for the typical end-user.  I've even tried "pop-out" time selection menus (which allow you to, for example, hover over the hour "10" to receive a submenu that contains ":00",":15",":30", and ":45") -- but none of these methods seem natural.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, the best (and most universal) method I have found is just using simple text fields and forcing a user to manually populate the hour, minute, and second.  Alternatively, I've had good experiences creating something similar to Outlook's "Day View" which allows you to drag and drop an event to set the start and end times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a "best way" to ask for this information?  Is anybody using some type of time input widget that's really intuitive and easy to use?  Or is there at least a way that's more efficient than using plain text boxes?&lt;/p&gt;

Most of the reflection code was only executed once, so any performance hit was quite small, but the benefits were great.

Class loadedClass = cl.loadClass("classname"); // must be in package.class name format

&lt;li&gt;(Some of your) &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25450/abstraction-away-from-css#25467" rel="nofollow"&gt;Variable and calculated&lt;/a&gt; field functionality can be taken care of through whatever templating engine you use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a combination of all these certianly solves a large sum of problems (although to be fair deeply learning CSS is not an option for everyone; some people just don't use it enough to justify the time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some problems none of the above points cover (certain types of calculated fields would require writing a JS library for, me thinks) but it's certainly a good start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tool-chain works like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers program the behavior of each window by hand-editing MXML files (it's not as hard as it sounds) and developing the corresponding .AS files at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designers make graphics for skins and other UI elements that get (link) exported and store them in .FLAs alongside the code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers [Import()] the resources in the .AS files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first started using CSS I also thought it was a pain that it didn't support variables, expressions, etc.  But as I started to use it more and more, I developed a different style to overcome these issues.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example, instead of this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a { color: red }
.entry { color: red }
h1 { color: red }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a, .entry, h1 { color: red }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can keep the color declared in one spot by doing this...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, once you use CSS enough you should be able to overcome most browser inconsistencies easily.  If you find that you need to use a CSS hack...there is probably a better way to do it...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Master pages give the ability to define pages in terms of content slotted into a master template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Master pages are a feature of ASP.Net (the .Net web framework), so you are looking for a feature similar to master pages in a Java web framework.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tiles.apache.org/framework/tutorial/basic/pages.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://tiles.apache.org/framework/tutorial/basic/pages.html&lt;/a&gt; gives some basic examples using Tiles and JSP to implement something similar with Struts, a Java web framework.  In this case, the Master Pages functionality is a plugin on top of Struts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Velocity is a generic templating engine, not specialized for web pages and definitely more complicated than you need.  (I've seen it used for code generation.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tapestry is more of a full featured web stack than Tile, and is probably good for your purposes.  Its templating functionality involves creating a component and putting all common markup in that.

&lt;li&gt;Solid Documentation - The docs are clear and to the point, with great examples&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep per-platform support - There are some unique features in the window service management system that are supported perfectly by service wrapper (w/o restarting).  And on Windows, you will even see your app name in the process list instead of just "java.exe".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standards Compliant - Unlike many ad-hoc Java init scripts, the scripts for service wrapper tend to be compliant with LSB standards.  This can end up being very important if you ever want high availability management from something like Linux Heartbeat/HA.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;H3Y5NC8E-TGA5B6SB-2NVAQ4E0

&lt;p&gt;and return the following using Split:
    H3Y5NC8E
    TGA5B6SB
    2NVAQ4E0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I validate each character against a specific character set (note that the letters 'I', 'O', 'U' &amp;amp; 'W' are absent), so using string.Split is not an option. The number of characters in each group can vary and the number of groups can also vary. I am using the following expression:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;([ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTVXYZ0123456789]{8}-?){3}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will match exactly 3 groups of 8 characters each. Any more or less will fail the match.
This works insofar as it correctly matches the input. However, when I use the Split method to extract each character group, I just get the final group. RegexBuddy complains that I have repeated the capturing group itself and that I should put a capture group around the repeated group. However, none of my attempts to do this achieve the desired result. I have been trying expressions like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(([ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTVXYZ0123456789]{8})-?){4}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this does not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I generate the regex in code, I could just expand it out by the number of groups, but I was hoping for a more elegant solution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that the character set does not include the entire alphabet. It is part of a product activation system. As such, any characters that can be accidentally interpreted as numbers or other characters are removed. e.g. The letters 'I', 'O', 'U' &amp;amp; 'W' are not in the character set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hyphens are optional since a user does not need top type them in, but they can be there if the user as done a copy &amp;amp; paste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you learn CSS to the point where you can code most things without having to look up the reference (if you're still looking up reference regularly you don't really know it and can't claim to complain I think), and then develop for firefox/safari, it's a pretty nice place to be in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nabble.com/String-upcase-downcase-with-UTF-8-strings-in-Ruby-1.9-td18372062.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;This mailing list question, with answer from Matz&lt;/a&gt; indicates that Ruby 1.9's built in &lt;code&gt;String#upcase&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;String#downcase&lt;/code&gt; methods will only handle ASCII characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without testing it myself, I would see this as strong evidence that all non-ascii characters in source code will likely be considered lowercase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can someone download and compile the latest 1.9 and see?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My generic suggestion, validate the charset in a first step, then split and parse in a seperate method based on what you expect. If this is in a web site/app then you can use the ASP Regex validation on the front end then break it up on the back end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so that has nothing to do with C's &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;That should get you your minimum requirements - rows with sales in either 2007 or 2008, or both. To get rows with no sales in either year, you just need to INNER JOIN to a 1-12 numbers table (you do &lt;a href="http://sqljunkies.com/WebLog/amachanic/articles/NumbersTable.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;have one of those&lt;/a&gt;, don't you?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One tutorial I really like is the &lt;a href="http://www.drpaulcarter.com/pcasm/"&gt;PC Assembly Tutorial&lt;/a&gt; (the zipper PDF can be found &lt;a href="http://www.drpaulcarter.com/pcasm/pcasm-book-pdf.zip"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) found here.  Until you create and run a simple program, and debug it, it will be difficult to understand assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cases it's easier to learn on a simpler processor.  I learned first on a Java simulator which used a simpler derivative of the x86 instruction set, with fewer registers, then moved up to programming on a &lt;a href="http://www.mgtek.com/miniide/resources/hc12.aspx"&gt;Motorola MC68HC12&lt;/a&gt; project board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you're comfortable with C, get a basic understanding of instructions and registers for your architecture, then run a debugger (GDB on Linux and WinDbg or OllyDebug on Windows) over some basic C apps to see how they run at that level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prefix version is always preferred over the postfix in regards to objects, especially in regards to iterators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for this if you look at the call pattern of the operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Prefix
Integer&amp;amp; Integer::operator++()
{
    *this += 1;
    return *this;
}

// Postfix
const Integer Integer::operator++(int)
{
    Integer oldValue = *this;
    ++(*this);
    return oldValue;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at this example it is easy to see how the prefix operator will always be more efficient than the postfix. Because of the need for a temporary object in the use of the postfix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why when you see examples using iterators they always use the prefix version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as you point out for int's there is effectively no difference because of compiler optimisation that can take place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way you can share code and link is via an intermediary datastructure.  Unfortunately, from what I understand, you can't modify the code that defines the interface between your C++ program and C library.  If you could, I'd suggest using something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;union boolean {
   bool value_cpp;
   int  value_c;

&lt;p&gt;The effect of which will be to make the datatype the same width in both languages; conversion to the native data type will need to be performed at both ends.  Swap the use of bool for boolean in the library function definition, fiddle code in the library to convert, and you're done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what you're going to have to do instead is create a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing)" rel="nofollow"&gt;shim&lt;/a&gt; between the C++ program and the C library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;extern "C" bool library_func_1(int i, char c, bool b);

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;bool library_func_1_cpp(int i, char c, bool b)
{
   int result = library_func_1(i, c, static_cast&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;(b));
   return (result==true);

&lt;p&gt;However if 'i' is  complex type then you may well find a measurable difference. For i++ you must make a copy of your class before incrementing it. Depending on what's involved in a copy it could indeed be slower since with ++it you can just return the final value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Foo Foo::operator++()
{
  Foo oldFoo = *this; // copy existing value - could be slow
  // yadda yadda, do increment
  return oldFoo;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another difference is that with ++i you have the option of returning a reference instead of a value. Again, depending on what's involved in making a copy of your object this could be slower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A real-world example of where this can occur would be the use of iterators. Copying an iterator is unlikely to be a bottle-neck in your application, but it's still good practice to get into the habit of using ++i instead of i++ where the outcome is not affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the steps that I followed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a href="http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow"&gt;FontForge&lt;/a&gt;. It's a lot easier to do this on linux than on windows/cygwin. I used a Ubuntu VM ("sudo apt-get install fontforge").&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Consola.ttf (the "normal" style font) in FontForge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select Element -&gt; Font Info.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the Fontname, Family Name, and Name for Humans, all to the same thing. I used 'ConsolasVS'.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Ok. Click 'Yes' to let FontForge generate a new GUID for the font.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select File -&gt; Generate Fonts. Make sure you've got "TrueType" selected. Uncheck "Validate before saving". Click Save.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now open Consolai.ttf (the italic style font) in FontForge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go back to Element -&gt; Font Info.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the Font names as before, and where it currently says "Italic", change that to "Bold".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the OS/2 tab, change the font weight to "700 Bold".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the Mac tab, change the style set to Bold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Ok. Allow a new GUID to be generated again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File -&gt; Generate Fonts, as before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copy your two new ttf files into your \Windows\FONTS\ folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now have nice italic comments with Consolas in VS2008. Hooray!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_Controller" rel="nofollow"&gt;Model-view-controller&lt;/a&gt; (MVC) is an architectural pattern used in software engineering. Successful use of the pattern isolates business logic from user interface considerations, resulting in an application where it is easier to modify either the visual appearance of the application or the underlying business rules without affecting the other. In MVC, the model represents the information (the data) of the application and the business rules used to manipulate the data; the view corresponds to elements of the user interface such as text, checkbox items, and so forth; and the controller manages details involving the communication to the model of user actions such as keystrokes and mouse movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, model - it holds the application and the business rules.&lt;/p&gt;

For the most part this works very well. I'd say 9 out of 10 times it's all you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some areas however where what you're submitting from a form doesn't match up with your model properly. There may be some additional filtering/rearranging or so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to solve these situations I've found is to create faux-model objects, which basically act like Model objects but map 1-to-1 with the form data. These faux-model objects don't actually save anything, they're just a bucket for the data with validations attached.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you stash a string into a constant variable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const std::string mystring = "my string";
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when you call methods, you use my_string, you're using a string constant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;someMethod(mystring);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, you can call those methods with the string literal directly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;someMethod("my string");
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason, presumably, that they encourage you to use string constants is because Objective C doesn't do "interning"; that is, when you use the same string literal in several places, it's actually a different pointer pointing to a separate copy of the string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For dictionary keys, this makes a huge difference, because if I can see the two pointers are pointing to the same thing, that's much cheaper than having to do a whole string comparison to make sure the strings have equal value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; Mike, in C# strings are immutable, and literal strings with identical values all end pointing at the same string value. I imagine that's true for other languages as well that have immutable strings. In Ruby, which has mutable strings, they offer a new data-type: symbols ("foo" vs. :foo, where the former is a mutable string, and the latter is an immutable identifier often used for Hash keys).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Using @ should make it easier to bolt an Objective-C compiler on to an existing C compiler. Because the @ isn't valid in any context in C except a string literal, the tokenizer (an early and simple step in the compiler) could be modified to simply look for the @ character outside of a string constant (the tokenizer understands string literals, so it is in a position to distinguish this). When @ is encountered the tokenizer would put the rest of the compiler in "Objective-C mode." (The Objective-C parser would be responsible for returning the compiler back to regular C mode when it detects the end of the Objective-C code). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use json_encode and json_decode if you want to reduce the number of lines of code you write. In the example in the question, a line of code was needed to copy each column in the database to the SESSION array. Instead of doing it with 50-75 lines of code, you could do it with 1 by json_encoding the entire database record into a string. This string can be stored in the SESSION variable. Later, when the user visits another page, the SESSION variable is there with the entire json string. If you then want to know the first name, you can use the following code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$fname = json_decode($_SESSION['data'])['fname'];
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method won't be faster than a line by line copy, but it will save coding and it will be more resistant to changes in your database or code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then wrap the user data in a class. Modifyng $_SESSION directly looks somewhat dirty. If you want to keep the data in a dictionary&amp;mdash;which you can still do even if you put it in a separate class. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could also implement a loop that iterates over all columns, gets their names and copy the data to a map with the same key names. That way your internal variables&amp;mdash;named by key in the dictionary&amp;mdash;and database column names would always be the same.

It does not make a constant string from a string literal as Mike assume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objective-C compilers typically &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; intern literal strings within compilation units  that is, they coalesce multiple uses of the same literal string  and it's possible for the linker to do additional interning across the compilation units that are directly linked into a single binary.  (Since Cocoa distinguishes between mutable and immutable strings, and literal strings are always also immutable, this can be straightforward and safe.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constant&lt;/strong&gt; strings on the other hand are typically declared and defined using syntax like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// MyExample.h - declaration, other code references this
extern NSString * const MyExampleNotification;

// MyExample.m - definition, compiled for other code to reference
NSString * const MyExampleNotification = @"MyExampleNotification";
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of the syntactic exercise here is that you can make &lt;em&gt;uses of&lt;/em&gt; the string efficient by ensuring that there's only one instance of that string in use &lt;em&gt;even across multiple frameworks&lt;/em&gt; (shared libraries) in the same address space.  (The placement of the &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; keyword matters; it guarantees that the pointer itself is guaranteed to be constant.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While burning memory isn't as big a deal as it may have been in the days of 25MHz 68030 workstations with 8MB of RAM, comparing strings for equality can take time.  Ensuring that most of the time strings that are equal will also be pointer-equal helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say, for example, you want to subscribe to notifications from an object by name.  If you use non-constant strings for the names, the &lt;code&gt;NSNotificationCenter&lt;/code&gt; posting the notification could wind up doing a lot of byte-by-byte string comparisons when determining who is interested in it.  If most of these comparisons are short-circuited because the strings being compared have the same pointer, that can be a big win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; public class Caller 
 {
     public static void Call() 
     {
         Traced traced = new Traced();

 public class Logger

     public static void LogEnd(MethodInfo method);
 }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I invoke &lt;em&gt;Logger.LogStart&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Logger.LogEnd&lt;/em&gt; for every call to &lt;em&gt;Method1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Method2&lt;/em&gt; without modifying the &lt;em&gt;Caller.Call&lt;/em&gt; method and without adding the calls explicitly to &lt;em&gt;Traced.Method1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Traced.Method2&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked up for ways to do exactly what you wanted to do and I found no easy way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I understand it, this is what you want to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Log()]
public void Method1(String name, Int32 value);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and in order to do that you have two main options&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inherit your class from MarshalByRefObject or ContextBoundObject and define an attribute which inherits from IMessageSink. &lt;a href="http://www.developerfusion.co.uk/show/5307/3/"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; has a good example. You have to consider nontheless that using a MarshalByRefObject the performance will go down like hell, and I mean it, I'm talking about a 10x performance lost so think carefully before trying that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other option is to inject code directly. In runtime, meaning you'll have to use reflection to "read" every class, get its attributes and inject the appropiate call (and for that matter I think you couldn't use the Reflection.Emit method as I think Reflection.Emit wouldn't allow you to insert new code inside an already existing method). At design time this will mean creating an extension to the CLR compiler which I have honestly no idea on how it's done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final option is using an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control"&gt;IoC framework&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe it's not the perfect solution as most IoC frameworks works by defining entry points which allow methods to be hooked but, depending on what you want to achive, that might be a fair aproximation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While your algorithm is slower, it doesn't progress steadily but instead performs random jumps. Additionally, slow sort's best case is still exponential while yours is constant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sqlite3 sample.db .dump &amp;gt; dump.sql
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can then (in theory) import this into the mysql database, in this case the test database on the database server 127.0.0.1, using user root.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mysql -p -u root -h 127.0.0.1 test &amp;lt; dump.sql
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say in theory as there are a few differences between grammars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sqlite transactions begin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;BEGIN TRANSACTION;
...
COMMIT;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MySQL uses just &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;BEGIN;
...
COMMIT;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other similar problems (varchars and double quotes spring back to mind) but nothing find and replace couldn't fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you should ask why you are migrating, if performance/ database size is the issue perhaps look at reoginising the schema, if the system is moving to a more powerful product this might be the ideal time to plan for the future of your data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personality type is really dependent upon the rest of the team. With only 20 people you should still just about be able to get some common ground on this. You're looking at a role that other people may not entirely understand the function of - it'd be useful to get a feel for the team's expectations. As you interview/meet people you should then be able to match their personality against expectations (even if those expectations are of skills and responsibilities, not specific personalities). It is very difficult to judge somebody's personality in a short period of time (even if they're ostensibly nice/arrogant/rude or whatever) - accordingly, you should set the role up so that it can wrap around their personality, not the other way around. This is far easier with a new position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technical background is generally helpful. Whilst it's not necessarily (responsibilities-wise) if they don't have one, it can cause clashes if they are managing/working with people who don't feel like they can be understood. However, avoid people who have a very specific technical background or are specialists in only one area (regardless of whether it's relevant to their new role) as they will be fighting a constant battle against their better judgement (and that of others) when it comes to operational issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age is, again, dependent on the rest of the team - not their ages, but their mindset. You need somebody with good experience, a rounded outlook on things and time spent working with different types of people. This will probably get you somewhere close to 30 already, because it's very difficult to get those things otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've never seen anything specific or consistent in terms of other factors - however - operations gurus seem to fall into one of two categories: those with few hobbies and passions outside of work; and those with many - particularly those into sports and physical activity. This could just be a weird by-product of the decent ops folk I've worked with, but it's certainly noticeable. The typical geeky kind have tended not to be great at operations, in my experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

So:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are language bindings?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do they work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically accessing functions from code written in language X of a library written in language Y.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A data binding copies the value of a property in one object to a property in another object. You can bind the properties of following objects: Flex components, Flex data models, and Flex data services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The object property that provides the data is known as the source property. The object property that receives the data is known as the destination property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following example binds the text property of a TextInput component (the source property) to the text property of a Label component (the destination property) so that text entered in the TextInput component is displayed by the Label component:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;mx:TextInput id="LNameInput"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/mx:TextInput&amp;gt;
...
&amp;lt;mx:Label text="{LNameInput.text}"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/mx:Label&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data binding is usually a simple way to bind a model to user interface components. For example, you have a class with a FirstName property. In flex you could easily bind that property to a textbox by setting the value of the textbox to {Object.FirstName}. Then, every time that FirstName property changes, the textbox will be updated without requiring you to write any code to monitor that property for changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps.&lt;/p&gt;

I do recommend to get a hold of a touch program to include in a pre-build step in order to touch the file that holds the use of the preprocessor variable. Touching a file makes sure, that its timestamp is newer than at the time it was last compiled. That way, the date/time in the compiled file is changed as well with each rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;
