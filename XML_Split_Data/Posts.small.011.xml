&lt;p&gt;Binding generally refers to a mapping of one thing to another - i.e. a datasource to a presentation object. It can typically refer to binding data from a database, or similar source (XML file, web service etc) to a presentation control or element - think list or table in HTML, combo box or data grid in desktop software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;...If that's the kind of binding you're interested in, read on...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You generally have to bind the presentation element to the datasource, not the other way around. This would involve some kind of mapping - i.e. which fields from the datasource do you want to appear in the output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, libsvn is the API for Subversion and was written in C.  If you want to access Subversion from within Java code you can use libsvn-java.  libsvn-java depends on libsvn being installed because libsvn-java is a mere bridge between the Java programming language and libsvn, providing an API that merely calls functions of libsvn to do the real work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you put these definitions in a .h file, and include the definitions from multiple .c/.cpp files, each file will have a different version of the date/time based on when it gets compiled.  So if you're looking to use the date/time in two different places and they should always match, you're in trouble.  If you're doing an incremental build, one of the files may be rebuilt while the other is not, which again results in time stamps that could be wildly different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A slightly better approach is to make GetBuildTimeStamp() prototypes in a .h file, and put the &lt;strong&gt;TIME&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;DATE&lt;/strong&gt; macros in the implementation(.c/.cpp) file.  This way you can use the time stamps in multiple places in your code and they will always match.  However you need to ensure that the .c/.cpp file is rebuilt every time a build is performed.  If you're doing clean builds then this solution may work for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're doing incremental builds, then you need to ensure the build stamp is updated on every build.  In Visual C++ you can do this with PreBuild steps - however in this case I would recommend that instead of using &lt;strong&gt;DATE&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;TIME&lt;/strong&gt; in a compiled .c/.cpp file, you use a text-based file that is read at run-time during your program's execution.  This makes it fast for your build script to update the timestamp (no compiling or linking required) and doesn't require your PreBuild step to understand your compiler flags or options.&lt;/p&gt;

On some projects I've worked on, clean builds take 80+ minutes (an embedded project consisting of thousands of C++ files to checkout and then compile against multiple targets).  In this case, you have to weigh the benefit of fast feedback against the likelihood that a clean build will catch something that an incremental build won't.  In our case, we worked on improving and parallelizing the build process while at the same time allowing incremental builds on our CI machine.  We did have a few problems because we weren't doing clean builds, but by doing a clean build nightly or weekly you could remove the risk without losing the fast feedback of your CI machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Background&lt;/strong&gt; - I think a lot depends on the nature of operations they'll be managing (for example, if it's the smooth day-to-day running of a data center, then I'd say a technical background is mandatory.) Another consideration is the culture of your firm. If your technical team is the type that perceives and appreciates value in non-technical roles (even if they'd rather not be involved in such roles), then a technical background may not be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age&lt;/strong&gt; - I think Age matters only if it means the candidates you're looking at have had actual work experience performing the role that you're hoping to fill. If they've had no specific experience, then IMHO Attitude is more important than Age. I personally appreciate people who are always hungry to learn, willing to try new things, and work well with others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hobbies and Environments&lt;/strong&gt; - Great question. I wish I had a good answer to this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parting thought: Personally, I feel that people in Operations have a thankless job. They don't get extra credit when they move heaven and earth to ensure that things are running well, because people think, "well, it's your job to keep things running well." On the other hand, they get all the flak when any little thing goes wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck on your search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET" rel="nofollow"&gt;ASP.NET &lt;/a&gt; (Wikipedia)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's on the second result searching on Google so I'm guessing (half-expecting) that you don't understand what that means either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Webpage development started with simple static HTML pages. That meant the client asked for a page by means of an URL and the server sent the page back to him/her exactly as it has been designed. Sometime after that several technologies emerged in order to provide a more "dynamic" or personalized experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several "server side languages" were developed (PHP, Perl, ASP...) which allowed the server to process the Web page before sending it back to the client. This way when a client requested a webpage the server could interpret the request, process it (for example connecting to a database and fetching some results) and send it back modifying the contents and making them "dynamic". The fact that the process took place on the server stands for the name of "server side".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the original ASP (predecessor of the ASP.NET) was a server side language that was focused on serving web pages. In such way it supported several shortcuts such as the possibility to intercalate HTML and ASP source into the file which was on that time much popular due to PHP implementation. It was also (as most of these languages) a dynamic language and it was interpreted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASP.NET is an evolution of that original ASP with some improvements. First it does truly (try to) separate the presentation (HTML) from the code (.cs) which may be implemented by using Visual Basic or C# syntax. It also incorporate some sort of compilation to the final ASP pages, encapsulating them into assemblies and thus improving performance. Finally it has access to the full .NET framework which supports a wide number of helper classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, summing up, it is a programming language located on the server and designed to make webpages.&lt;/p&gt;

Especially for ActionScript that can be decompiled into somewhat readable code without too much effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I've been doing it is a rather conventional approach of sending the score and player name in plain text and then a hash of the two (properly salted). Very few people are determined enough to take the effort to figure that out, and the few who are would do it anyway, negating all the time you put into it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, my philosophy is to spend the time on making the game better and just make it hard enough to cheat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that might be pretty effective is to have the game submit the score to the server several times as you are playing, sending a bit of gameplay information each time, allowing you to validate if the score is "realistic". But that might be a bit over-the-top really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Oracle doesn't require any kind of licensing confirmation for the full server; you have to click something to say that you have indeed acquired a license, but it doesn't make you prove it.

Loading significant chunks of that data can take some time and we have implemented various measures to reduce the amount of data that has to be searched and loaded for larger queries, such as storing larger granularities for queries that don't require a high resolution (time-wise).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When searching for data in our backup archives, where the data is stored in bzipped text files, but has basically the same structure, I noticed that it is significantly faster to untar to stdout and pipe it through grep than to untar it to disk and grep the files. In fact, the untar-to-pipe was even noticeably faster than just grepping the uncompressed files (i. e. discounting the untar-to-disk).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This made me wonder if the performance impact of disk I/O is actually much heavier than I thought. So here's my question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you think putting the data of multiple rows into a (compressed) blob field of a single row and search for single rows on the fly during extraction could be faster than searching for the same rows via the table index?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, instead of having this table&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CREATE TABLE data ( `source` INT, `type` INT, `timestamp` INT, `value` DOUBLE);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would have&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CREATE TABLE quickdata ( `source` INT, `type` INT, `day` INT, `dayvalues` BLOB );
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;with approximately 100-300 rows in data for each row in quickdata and searching for the desired timestamps on the fly during decompression and decoding of the blob field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this make sense to you? What parameters should I investigate? What strings might be attached? What DB features (any DBMS) exist to achieve similar effects?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send some additional information with the high score requests to validate one the server side. If you get 5 points for every X, and the game only contains 10 Xs, then you've got some extra hoops to make the hacker to jump through to get their score accepted as valid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have the server send a random challenge which must be met with a few bytes of the game's binary from that offset. That means the hacker must keep a pristine copy of the binary around (just a bit more trouble).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have license keys, require high scores to include them, so you can ban people caught hacking the system. This also lets you track invalid attempts as defined above, to ban people testing out the protocol before the ever even submit a valid score.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for which framework to use - why not create your own? Spend a good amount of time pre-coding deciding how you're going to handle various things - such as langauge support: you could use a phrase system or seperate langauge-specific templates. Third party frameworks are probably better tested than one you make but they're not created for a specific purpose, they're created for a wide range of purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This made me wonder if the performance impact of disk I/O is actually much heavier than I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely. If you have to go to disk, the performance hit is many orders of magnitude greater than memory. This reminds me of the classic Jim Gray paper, &lt;a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/pubs/view.aspx?tr_id=655" rel="nofollow"&gt;Distributed Computing Economics&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Computing economics are changing. Today there is rough price parity between (1) one database access, (2) ten bytes of network traffic, (3) 100,000 instructions, (4) 10 bytes of disk storage, and (5) a megabyte of disk bandwidth. This has implications for how one structures Internet-scale distributed computing: one puts computing as close to the data as possible in order to avoid expensive network traffic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question, then, is how much data do you have and how much memory can you afford?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if the database gets &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; big -- as in nobody could ever afford that much memory, even in 20 years -- you need clever distributed database systems like Google's &lt;a href="http://research.google.com/archive/bigtable.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;BigTable&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/core/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Hadoop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've never implemented such thing but here's a simple aproximmation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your main concern is due to hackers guessing what is it your application is doing and then sending their own results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, first of all, unless your application has a great success I wouldn't be worried. Doing such thing is extremely difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encryption won't help with the problem. You see, encryption helps to protect the data on its way but it doesn't protect either of the sides of the transaction before the data is encrypted (which is where the main vulnerability may be). So if you encrypt the sure, the data will remain private but it won't be safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are really worried about it I will suggest obfuscating the code and designing the score system in a way which is not completely obvious what is doing. Here we can borrow some things from an encryption protocol. Here is an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let's say the score is some number m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compute some kind of check over the score (for example the CRC or any other system you see feet. In fact, if you just invent one, no matter how lame is it it will work better)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obtain the private key of the user (D) from your remote server (over a secure connection obviously). You're the only one which know this key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compute X=m^D mod n (n being the public module of your public/private key algorithm) (that is, encrypt it :P)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you see that's just obfuscation of another kind. You can go down that way as long as you want. For example you can lookup the nearest two prime numbers to X and use them to encrypt the CRC and send it also to the server so you'll have the CRC and the score separately and with different encryption schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use that in conjunction with obfuscation I'd say that would be difficult to hack. Nontheless even that could be reverse engingeered, it all depends on the interest and ability of the hacker but ... seriously, what kind of freak takes so much effort to change its results on a game? (Unless is WoW or something)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In fact, how does one represent i (or j for the engineers) in a conventional programming language?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a language that doesn't have a native representation, it is usually added using OOP to create a &lt;code&gt;Complex&lt;/code&gt; class to represent &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt;, with operator overloading to properly deal with operations involving other &lt;code&gt;Complex&lt;/code&gt; numbers and or other number primitives native to the language.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I would reccomend sticking to what you know - PHP is more than capable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's true of course, but:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I don't mind, and I would even like to use this as an excuse, learning some new thing like Python or Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then writing a browser game is an excellent opportunity to do this. Learning something new is never wrong and learning an alternative to PHP can never hurt (&lt;a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001119.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;eh, Jeff?&lt;/a&gt;). While neither Ruby on Rails nor Django are especially useful for writing games, they're still great. We had to write a small browser game in a matter of weeks for a project once and Rails worked charms. On the other hand, all successful browser games have enormous work loads and if you want to scale well you either have to get good hardware and load balancing or you need a non-interpreted framework (sorry, guys!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, here are some issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cropped images vs. an uncropped image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;images with a text added vs. another without&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mirrored images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest and simplest &lt;em&gt;algorithm&lt;/em&gt; I've seen for this is just to do the following steps to each image:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scale to something small, like 64x64 or 32x32, disregard aspect ratio, use a combining scaling algorithm instead of nearest pixel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scale the color ranges so that the darkest is black and lightest is white&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rotate and flip the image so that the lighest color is top left, and then top-right is next darker, bottom-left is next darker (as far as possible of course)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt; A &lt;em&gt;combining scaling algorithm&lt;/em&gt; is one that when scaling 10 pixels down to one will do it using a function that takes the color of all those 10 pixels and combines them into one. Can be done with algorithms like averaging, mean-value, or more complex ones like bicubic splines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then calculate the mean distance pixel-by-pixel between the two images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To look up a possible match in a database, store the pixel colors as individual columns in the database, index a bunch of them (but not all, unless you use a very small image), and do a query that uses a range for each pixel value, ie. every image where the pixel in the small image is between -5 and +5 of the image you want to look up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is easy to implement, and fairly fast to run, but of course won't handle most advanced differences. For that you need much more advanced algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you're using SQL Server to back a Web application, you probably don't have any choice: unless you want to buy a CAL for every user or computer that hits your Web site, you need to purchase processor licenses. On the other hand, for internal applications you may be better off with CALs if there are a limited number of devices or users that will access the SQL Server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, do a break-even analysis - how wide is the audience for this web app, would you ever want to use the same SQL instance for other webapps, and would the total number of users exceed the cost of a processor license?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most likely, a processor license will be the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CAL = Client Access License (nothing to do with MS-Access tho). 
Device = Device License.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the difference relies on how you want your users to connect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have 10 users, you'll need 10 licences. Either CAL or Device. This is best described by Microsoft itself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Device CALs. Optimized for non-Web-based scenarios in which there are multiple users per device (for example, kiosks). A license is required for the computer running SQL Server 2005, as well as a CAL for each client device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means, you have 10 users, but 5 computers. So the users "share" the Licence. The licence belongs to the device (computer or whatever). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;User CALs. Optimized for non-Web-based scenarios in which there are multiple devices per user (for example, a laptop, PDA, and home PC). A license is required for the computer running SQL Server 2005, as well as a CAL for each user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could have only 5 users, but each user has two computers (One laptop and one desktop). The license "belongs to the user". So when you (the user) login, you're using your CAL. If you logoff, you can later relogin from another computer, using your USER CAL. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps :) It's a little bit weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your case, since you're going to use an intranet website, the connection is always established from the server's backend to the SQL, you might want to consider Processor License; In that scenario, you pay per processor on the server (CPUs) and need neither User CAL nor Device CAL. If you talk to Microsoft, they'll often offer you the best alternative for your scenario. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;INSERT INTO x SELECT * FROM other_db.y;

&lt;p&gt;This is a hack to be honest, as you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; return every column to hydrate your object correctly.  But I thought to include this reader method as it would actually grab all the columns, even if they are not defined in your table schema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach to mapping your relational data into your domain model might cause some issues when you get into a lazy loading scenario.  &lt;/p&gt;

On the website folder the ISAPI Filter is set to ASP.NET 2.0.  My first guess about the problem was having ASP.NET 1.1 and ASP.NET 2.0 running side by side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Device CALs&lt;/strong&gt; provide access to a "device" (namely a client computer most of the time), no matter how many different users have login access to that device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User CALs&lt;/strong&gt; provide access to a "user", that can login from as many "devices" as he wants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how to decide? Depends on your architecture. The rules are simple: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have more devices than users accessing the database: buy "user" CALs. An example of this might be an organization where you have just 3 users connecting to the server using any of 10 computers (not a far-off case, considering laptops, other servers, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have a lot of users accessing a server through an small set of devices: buy Device CALs. An example of this would be a library, where you have (say) 10 people accessing the server through 3 terminals in the building. In that case, buying just 3 Device CALs will cover the accesses to the server y &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; of the users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have a number of users accessing the server through an specific computer: buy Device CALs. An example of this is a recruiting agency, where consultants are variable (you might be hiring new people all the time, or you might have part-time workers sharing a single desktop at different times of the day). In fact this is just a case (considering future hires/part-timers) of the previous rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure to take into consideration how the user/device map might grow in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

I can say that we use an O/R Mapper and each "query" to the database needs an object called PersistenceBroker.

&lt;p&gt;We've written a PersistenceBrokerFactory.GetCurrentBroker() which returns the "working" broker. If the DB suddenly fails (for whatever reason), the CONN object will "timeout()" after 30secs (or whatever you define). If that happens, we show the user that he/she is offline and display a reconnect button. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, to provide a visual indication that the user has connectivity, we have a thread running in the background, that checks for Internet connectivity every 15 seconds. We do 1 ping to google.com. ;) If that fails, we assume Internet is somehow broken, and we update a status bar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The configuration name in the category section is correct and the class in the class section, i believe, is correctly implemented. (basically copied from org.eclipse.jdt.debug.ui.launchConfigurations.JavaApplicationLaunchShortcut)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance.

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm really not sure if I'm supposed to write a follow-up here but let me clarify my question more.
I've extended org.eclipse.jdt.debug.ui.launchConfigurations.JavaLaunchShortcut. 
Plus, I've added my own logger to constructors and methods, but the class seems like it's never even instantiating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks.

Each of these services contain a timer that fires every minute or so, where the majority of their work happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My problem is that, as these services run, they start to consume more and more CPU time through each iteration of the loop, even if there is no meaningful work for them to do (ie, they're just idling, looking through the database for something to do). When they start up, each service uses an average of (about) 2-3% of 4 CPUs, which is fine. After 24 hours, each service will be consuming an entire processor for the duration of its loop's run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can anyone help? I'm at a loss as to what could be causing this. Our current solution is to restart the services once a day (they shut themselves down, then a script sees that they're offline and restarts them at about 3AM). But this is not a long term solution; my concern is that as the services get busier, restarting them once a day may not be sufficient... but as there's a significant startup penalty (they all use NHibernate for data access), as they get busier, exactly what we &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; want to be doing is restarting them more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@akmad: True, it is very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, a service run in isolation will show the same symptom over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No, it doesn't. We've looked at that. This can happen at 10AM or 6PM or in the middle of the night. There's no consistency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We do; and they are. The services are doing exactly what they should be, and nothing else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately, that requires foreknowledge of exactly when the services are going to be maxing out CPUs, which happens on an unpredictable schedule, and never very quickly... which makes things doubly difficult, because my boss will run and restart them when they start having problems without thinking of debug issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No, they're using a fairly consistent amount of RAM (approx. 60-80MB each, out of 4GB on the machine).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good suggestions, but rest assured, we have tried all of the usual troubleshooting. What I'm hoping is that this is a .NET issue that someone might know about, that we can work on solving. My boss' solution (which I emphatically don't want to implement) is to put a field in the database which holds multiple times for the services to restart during the day, so that he can make the problem go away and not think about it. I'm desperately seeking the cause of the real problem so that I can fix it, because that solution will become a disaster in about six months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Yaakov Ellis: They each have a different function. One reads records out of an Oracle database somewhere offsite; another one processes those records and transfers files belonging to those records over to our system; a third checks those files to make sure they're what we expect them to be; another is a maintenance service that constantly checks things like disk space (that we have enough) and polls other servers to make sure they're alive; one is running only to make sure all of these other ones are running and doing their jobs, monitors and reports errors, and restarts anything that's failed to keep the whole system going 24 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you're asking what I think you're asking, no, there isn't one common thing that all these services do (other than database access via NHibernate) that I can point to as a potential problem. Unfortunately, if that turns out to be the actual issue (which wouldn't surprise me greatly), the whole thing might be screwed -- and I'll end up rewriting all of them in simple SQL. I'm hoping it's a garbage collector problem or something easier to deal with than NHibernate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Joshdan: No secret. As I said, we've tried all the usual troubleshooting. Profiling was unhelpful: the profiler we use was unable to point to any code that was actually executing when the CPU usage was high. These services were torn apart about a month ago looking for this problem. Every section of code was analyzed to attempt to figure out if our code was the issue; I'm not here asking because I haven't done my homework. Were this a simple case of the services doing more work than anticipated, that's something that would have been caught. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that, most of the time, the services are not doing anything at all, yet still manage to consume 25% or more of four CPU cores: they're finding no work to do, and exiting their loop and waiting for the next iteration. This should, quite literally, take almost no CPU time at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a example of behaviour we're seeing, on a service with no work to do for two days (in an unchanging environment). This was captured last week:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 1, 8AM: Avg. CPU usage approx 3%&lt;br&gt;
Day 1, 6PM: Avg. CPU usage approx 8%&lt;br&gt;
Day 2, 7AM: Avg. CPU usage approx 20%&lt;br&gt;
Day 2, 11AM: Avg. CPU usage approx 30%  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having looked at all of the possible mundane reasons for this, I've asked this question here because I figured (rightly, as it turns out) that I'd get more innovative answers (like Ubiguchi's), or pointers to things I &lt;em&gt;hadn't&lt;/em&gt; thought of (like Ian's suggestion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So does the CPU spike happen
  immediately preceding the timer
  callback, within the timer callback,
  or immediately following the timer
  callback?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You misunderstand. This is not a spike. If it were, there would be no problem; I can deal with spikes. But it's not... the CPU usage is going up generally. Even when the service is doing nothing, waiting for the next timer hit. When the service starts up, things are nice and calm, and the graph looks like what you'd expect... generally, 0% usage, with spikes to 10% as NHibernate hits the database or the service does some trivial amount of work. But this increases to an across-the-board 25% (more if I let it go too far) usage at all times while the process is running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That made Ian's suggestion the logical silver bullet (NHibernate does &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of stuff when you're not looking). Alas, I've implemented his solution, but it hasn't had an effect (I have no proof of this, but I actually think it's made things worse... average usage is &lt;em&gt;seeming&lt;/em&gt; to go up much faster now). Note that stripping out the NHibernate "sections" (as you recommend) is not feasible, since that would strip out about 90% of the code in the service, which would let me rule out the timer as a problem (which I absolutely intend to try), but can't help me rule out NHibernate as the issue, because if NHibernate is causing this, then the dodgy fix that's implemented (see below) is just going to have to become The Way The System Works; we are so dependent on NHibernate for this project that the PM simply won't accept that it's causing an unresolvable structural problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I just noted a sense of desperation in
  the question -- that your problems
  would continue barring a small miracle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't mean for it to come off that way. At the moment, the services are being restarted daily (with an option to input any number of hours of the day for them to shutdown and restart), which patches the problem but cannot be a long-term solution once they go onto the production machine and start to become busy. The problems will not continue, whether I fix them or the PM maintains this constraint on them. Obviously, I would prefer to implement a real fix, but since the initial testing revealed no reason for this, and the services have already been extensively reviewed, the PM would rather just have them restart multiple times than spend any more time trying to fix them. That's entirely out of my control and makes the miracle you were talking about more important than it would otherwise be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That is extremely intriguing (insofar
  as you trust your profiler).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't. But then, these are Windows services written in .NET 1.1 running on a Windows 2000 machine, deployed by a dodgy Nant script, using an old version of NHibernate for database access. There's little on that machine I would actually say I trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The canonical way is to use a metafunction like thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;template &amp;lt;typename T&amp;gt;
struct my_string_map {
    typedef std::map&amp;lt;std::string, T&amp;gt; type;

I do not know if the right term for this is &lt;i&gt;Course Scheduler&lt;/i&gt; but I shall describe this in more detail here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Course Scheduler&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The widget would be used to enter date and times of a course, as an example if I run a programming course 3 days a week on Mon, Tue and Wed every 7:00 am to 9:00am, 2 hours every day from 1st September to 30th November. I could answer various questions and the course data would be displayed in the calendar. It would also allow for non pattern based timings where each week is different from the other week etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Question&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So would I end up creating something from scratch? Would it be sensible to use Google Calendar API for this? I did a Google search for some widgets, but I believe I need better keywords, as I could not find anything close to what I am looking for. Any tips? Commercial libraries would also work for me. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you make a call to a method, function or procedure the "standard" way or making the call consists on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pushing the return direction for the call into the stack(that's the next sentence after the call)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usually the space for the return value get reserved into the stack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pushing each parameter into the stack (the order diverges and depends on each compiler, also some of them are sometimes stored on the CPU registers for performance improvements)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making the actual call.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, usually this takes a few bytes depeding on the number and type of the parameters as well as the machine architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll see then that if you start making recursive calls the stack will begin to grow. Now, stack is usually reserved in memory in such a way that it grows in opposite direction to the heap so, given a big number of calls without "coming back" the stack begins to get full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, on older times stack overflow could occur simply because you exausted all available memory, just like that. With the virtual memory model (up to 4GB on a X86 system) that was out of the scope so usually, if you get an stack overflow error, look for an infinite recursive call.&lt;/p&gt;

Remember, valid floating points include: 10, 10., 10.123, 9.876e-5, 1.0f, .025, etc. I assume some dispensation from this (in favor of simplicty and brevity) was made in the interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click-in-the-text is nice, but there is another reason to use the &amp;lt;label&amp;gt; tag: accessibility. The tools that visually-impaired people use to access the web need the &amp;lt;label&amp;gt;s to read-out the meaning of checkboxes and radio buttons. Without &amp;lt;label&amp;gt;s, they have to guess based on surrounding text, and they often get it wrong or have to give up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very frustrating to be faced with a form that reads &lt;em&gt;"Please select your shipping method, radio-button1, radio-button2, radio-button3".&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;What happens when you only run one of the services at a time?  Do you still see the slow-down?  This may indicate that there is some contention between the services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the problem always occur around the same time, regardless of how long the service has been running?  This may indicate that something else (a backup, virus scan, etc) is causing the machine (or db) as a whole to slow down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have logging or some other mechanism to be sure that the service is only doing work as often as you think it should?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can see the performance degradation over a short time period, try running the service for a while and then attach a profiler to see exactly what is pegging the CPU.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first suggestion is your services might have some bugs in either the way they handle memory, or perhaps in the way they handle unmanaged memory. The last time I tracked down a similar issue it turned out a 3rd party OSS libray we were using stored handles to unmanaged objects in static memory. The longer the service ran the more handles the service picked up which caused the process' CPU performance to nose-dive very quickly. The way to try and resolve this sort of issue to ensure your services store nothing in memory inbetween the timer invocations, although if your 3rd party libraries use static memory you might have to do something clever like create an app domain for the timer invocation and ditch the app doamin (and its static memory) once processing is complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other issue I've seen in similar circumstances was with the timer synchronization code being suspect, which in effect allowed more than one thread to be running the processing code at once. When we debugged the code we found the 1st thread was blocking the 2nd, and by the time the 2nd kicked off there was a 3rd being blocked. Over time the blocking was lasting longer and longer and the CPU usage was therefore heading to the top. The solution we used to fix the issue was to implement proper synchronization code so the timer only kicked off another thread if it wouldn't be blocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps, but apologies up front if both my thoughts are red herrings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A padding scheme is usually applied because most cryptographic filters are not semantically secure and to prevent some forms of cryptoatacks. For example, usually in RSA the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_Asymmetric_Encryption_Padding"&gt;OAEP&lt;/a&gt; padding scheme is used which prevents some sorts of attacks (such as a chosen plaintext attack or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinding_(cryptography)"&gt;blinding&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A padding scheme appends some (usually) random garbage to the message m before the message is sent. In the OAEP method, for example, two Oracles are used (this is a simplistic explanation):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given the size of the modulus you padd k1 bits with 0 and k0 bits with a random number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then by applying some transformation to the message you obtain the padded message wich is encrypted and sent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That provides you with a randomization for the messages and with a way to test if the message is garbage or not. As the padding scheme is reversible, when you decrypt the message whereas you can't say anything about the integrity of the message itself you can, in fact, make some assertion about the padding and thus you can know if the message has been correctly decrypted or you're doing something wrong (i.e someone has tampered with the message or you're using the wrong key)&lt;/p&gt;

You might have one unit of work blocking another running on different worker threads, causing them to stack up every time the timer fires.  Or you might have instances living and working longer than you expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd suggest refactoring out the timer.  Replace it with a single thread that queues up work on the ThreadPool.  You can Sleep() the thread to control how often it looks for new work.  Make sure this is the only place where your code is multithreaded.  All other objects should be instantiated as work is readied for processing and destroyed after that work is completed.  STATE IS THE ENEMY in multithreaded code.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area where the design is lacking appears to be that you have multiple services that are polling resources to do something.  I'd suggest unifying them under a single service.  They might do seperate things, but they're working in unison; you're just using the filesystem, database, etc as a substitution for method calls.  Also, 2003?  I feel bad for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) If you really wanted to you could write the controller in VBScript and then access that in the page.  It would resemble a Page Controller pattern and not a Front Controller that you would see in ASP.NET MVC or MonoRail&lt;/p&gt;

  markers.setFocus(oi);
  mapView.postInvalidate();

First, find a way to reproduce the problem 100% of the times and quickly. Lower the timer so that the services fire up more frequently (for example, 10 times quicker than normal). If the problem arises 10 times quicker, then it's related to the number of iterations and not to real time or to real work done by the services). And you will be able to do the next steps quicker than once a day.&lt;br /&gt;
Second, comment out all the real work code, and let only the services, the timers and the synchronization mechanism. If the problem still shows up, than it will be in that part of the code.
If it doesn't, then start adding back the code you commented out, one piece at a time. Eventually, you should find out what part of the code is causing the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Georgia&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question isn't about design patterns or pattern languages; it's about trying to see if more of Christopher Alexander's work can be applied to software (which it probably can, since it has even less physical constraints than architecture and building).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design patterns and pattern languages seem to have embraced the structure of Alexander's design patterns, but not many capture the essence. The essence being something beyond solving a problem in a particular context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's difficult to explain without using some of Alexander's later works as a reference point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: No, I take that back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, there's an architectural design pattern that is called Alcoves. The pattern has a context that isn't just rooted in the circumstances of the situation but also rooted in fundamentals about the purpose of buildings: that they are structures to be lived in and must promote living in them. In the case of the Alcove pattern, the context is that you want an area that allows for multiple people to be in the same area doing different things, because it is important for family members to be physically together as well as to be able to do things that tend to distract other family members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most software design patterns describe a problem in a context, but they make no deeper statement about why the problem is important, or why the problem is something that is fundamental to software. It makes it very easy to apply design patterns inappropriately or blithely, which is the exact opposite of the intent of design patterns to begn with.&lt;/p&gt;

I'll leave my original message in place just in case anyone who &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; interested in web forms MVC needs the links. :-)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple MVC frameworks out there, neither of which are very "lightweight", but MVC is a pretty big shift away from web forms so that is expected:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/" rel="nofollow"&gt;ASP.NET MVC&lt;/a&gt; - This is Microsoft's attempt at an MVC framework.  It is still in preview mode so use it at your own discretion, but several people are already using it in their production applications.  You will find ample documentation on this with a simple Google search as it is becoming very popular amongst the .NET crowd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.castleproject.org/MonoRail/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Castle MonoRail&lt;/a&gt; - The MonoRail framework is an open-source MVC framework that has been around for quite some time and is in use on several production applications.  It is definitely more flushed out than the ASP.NET MVC framework, but considering the amount of effort Microsoft is throwing at their MVC offering, I think will change relatively soon.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One negative to add is that pointers to the stack are no longer valid when the function returns, so you cannot return a pointer to a stack variable from a function. This is a common error and a major reason why you can't get by with just stack variables. If your function needs to return a pointer, then you have to malloc and deal with memory management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm actually moving away from the registry for user settings because of the debug/footprint factor. I'm currently only storing a few basic settings (window size, position, version of a data file) in the registry, and I've run into more problems if an update goes bad or a user loses a second monitor and that is where the application was opening to. A few of them are savvy enough to understand regedit, but for the rest they have to do a reinstall, which is quick, but I think they grumble a bit. With the file based version, all I'd have to do is have them open up an XML file in Notepad and make a quick tweak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I'm looking to make my application runnable off a USB flash drive, and having the settings tied into the file seems much friendlier to that process. I'm sure I can do some code to check/clean the registry, but I think most of us are already tired of the registry clutter that seems to eat up our machines nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know there are some security tradeoffs to this, but none of the data I'm sorting is that critical to that cause, and I'm not suffering any performance hits due to the size of the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contract approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a method does not do what it says it will do in the method header, it will throw an exception. Thus the method "promises" that it will do the operation, and if it fails for some reason, it will throw an exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exceptional approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only throw exceptions when something truly weird happens. You should not use exceptions when you can resolve the situation with normal control flow (If statements). You don't use Exceptions for control flow, as you might in the contract approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets use both approaches in different cases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a Customer class that has a method called OrderProduct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;contract approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Customer
{
     public void OrderProduct(Product product)
     {
           if((m_credit - product.Price) &amp;lt; 0)
                  throw new NoCreditException("Not enough credit!");
           // do stuff 
     }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;exceptional approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Customer
{
     public bool OrderProduct(Product product)
     {
          if((m_credit - product.Price) &amp;lt; 0)
                   return false;
          // do stuff
          return true;
     }
}

if !(customer.OrderProduct(product))
            Console.WriteLine("Not enough credit!");
else
   // go on with your life
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I prefer the exceptional approach, as it is not truly Exceptional that a customer has no money assuming he did not win the lottery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here is a situation I err on the contract style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exceptional:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class CarController
{
     // returns null if car creation failed.
     public Car CreateCar(string model)
     {
         // something went wrong, wrong model
         return null;
     }
 }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I call a method called CreateCar, I damn wel expect a Car instance instead of some lousy null pointer, which can ravage my running code a dozen lines later. Thus I prefer contract to this one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class CarController
{

     public Car CreateCar(string model)
     {
         // something went wrong, wrong model
         throw new CarModelNotKnownException("Model unkown");

         return new Car();
     }
 }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which do style do you use? What do you think is best general approach to Exceptions?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So, you're saying that rather than using a prefix naming convention to instead create and always use two new classes: SafeString and UnsafeString?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Sounds like a much better choice to me. Compile errors are much better than run-time errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly. Bruce Eckel wrote an &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/View?id=dcsvntt2_25wpjvbbhk" rel="nofollow"&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; arguing that static typing is superfluously because, hey, you're writing test cases anyway, right? Wrong. Of course I'm writing test cases but writing good test cases is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; and a lot of work. It's good to take all the help you can get and compile-time type checking is pretty much the best help you can get. Additionally, when using tests, even when using an automated test-on-checkin process, the failed test will be signalled much later than a compile-time error, resulting in delayed error correction. Compilers can give a more direct feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's not to say that I don't see the advantages of interpreted languages I do  but dynamic typing can be a huge disadvantage. I'm actually disappointed that there is no modern interpreted language with static typing, because as Joel shows, this makes writing correct code so much harder and forces us to resort to second-class hacks like Apps Hungarian.&lt;/p&gt;

Anyway, PostgreSQL documentation has a chapter on &lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/gist.html"&gt;GIST&lt;/a&gt; and one on &lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/gin.html"&gt;GIN&lt;/a&gt;, where you can find more info.&lt;br /&gt;
And, last but not least, the best way to find which is best is to generate sample data (as much as you need to be a real scenario) and then create a GIST index, measuring how much time is needed to create the index, insert a new value, execute a sample query. Then drop the index and do the same with a GIN index. Compare the values and you will have the answer you need, based on your data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MVC is not limited to a web technology, in fact the original smalltalk MVC was for desktop applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View = Client Form&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Controller = Wraps up Client Events and marshals between View and Model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model = Application Data and Business Logic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In pure Smalltalk MVC, the View is not limited to being a form, but can be any representation of Model Data...For example, if we had a Model that represented a spreadsheet, we could have the following views:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SpreadSheet View&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Printer Friendly View&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Icon View&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;etc, the Model would be the same, but the View would create a different output object in each case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that said, I don't know if such a framework exists for the .NET Compact framework, I just wanted to point out that MVC does not mean WebApp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every error on the arguments is not handled. An exception is raised and the "client" is in charge of handling it. On the other hand, for internal errors always try to correct them (as if you can't get a database connection for some reason) and only if you can't handle it reraise the exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important to keep in mind that most unhandled exception at such level will not be able to be handled by the client anyway so they will just probably go up to the most general exception handler, so if such an exception occurs you are probably FUBAR anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One other measure of defensive programming is always to use a break statement in each switch code block (i.e. do not let a case statement "fall through" to the next one). The only exception is if multiple case statements are to be handled identically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes handling case X and case Y means doing &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; the same thing, in which case falling through to the next case makes for code that's easier to read. It's a good idea to specifically indicate that with a comment though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;switch( type ) {
case TypeA:
   do some stuff specific to type A
   // FALL THROUGH
case TypeB:
   do some stuff that applies to both A and B
   break
case TypeC:
   ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use this convention, all case statements should then have a break, a return, a continue or a comment indicating that it's falling through. An empty case without the comment is OK though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;case TypeA:
case TypeB:
   // code for both types

We still use one part of it (EventBroker) at work and I'd like to even remove that part if possible (as it doesn't support generic events and you have to cast the arguments into their strong types from EventArgs). A sister project at work used it for part of their UI but had to rip it out due to performance issues (another big project, although that has additional performance issues of it's own as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue I find with the MVP framework that the P&amp;amp;P lib offers is that Forms and Controls OWN presenters instead of Presenters/Controllers owning Forms (who didn't read "It's just a view" : Pragmatic Programmer?). 
This fits beautifully with MS's "Form First" rapid application development mantra but it sucks when you consider how expensive windows handles can be in CE (if you have a lot of them).
We run a very large CF application at work and we've rolled our own MVC framework. It's not hard to roll your own, just make sure you separate everything out into Controllers, Views, Business Objects and Services and have a UIController that controls the interactions between the controllers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We actually go one step further and re-use forms/controls by using a Controller-&gt;View-&gt;Layout pattern.
The controller is the same as usual, the view is the object that customises a layout into a particular view and the layout is the actual UserControl. We then swap these in and out of a single Form. This reduces the amount of Windows Controls we use dramatically.
This + initialising all of the forms on start-up means that we eradicate the noticable pause that you get when creating new Windows Controls "on-demand".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously it only really pays to do this kind of thing if you are rolling a large application. We have roughly 20 + different types of View which use in total about 7 different layouts. This hurts our initialisation routine (as we load the forms at start up) by a magnitude of about 10 seconds but psychologically most users are willing to accept such a hit at start up as opposed to noticeable pauses during run-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main issue with the P&amp;amp;P library in my books is that it is a FF -&gt; CF port and due to certain incompatability and performance differences between the two platforms you lose a lot of useful functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Btw, &lt;a href="http://ctrl-shift-b.blogspot.com/2007/08/interactive-application-architecture.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is by far and away the most comprehensive article i've ever read on MVC/MVP.
For Windows application (desktop or CE) I'd recommend using the Taligent Model-View-Presenter version without the interactions, commands and selections (e.g the controller/presenter performs all the work).&lt;/p&gt;

It should work in all instances, if there is an entity by the same id in the session or if there is no entity at all.

'testvar' is not a recognized OPTIMIZER LOCK HINTS option.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passing a hard-coded string as the argument to fnSplitStringToInt works in both 2k and 2k5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know why this doesn't work in 2k? Is this perhaps a known bug in the query planner? Any suggestions for how to make it work? Again, I realize that the real answer is "don't store CSV lists in your DB!", but alas, that's beyond my control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some sample data, if it helps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;INSERT INTO usertable (legacyCSVVarcharCol) values ('1,2,3');
INSERT INTO usertable (legacyCSVVarcharCol) values ('11,13,42');
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the data in the table does not seem to matter since this is a syntax error, and it occurs even if usertable is completely empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Realizing that perhaps the initial example was unclear, here are two examples, one of which works and one of which does not, which should highlight the problem that's occurring:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;--fails in sql2000, works in 2005

SELECT t1.* 
FROM usertable t1
WHERE 1 in 
    (Select val 
     from 
     fnSplitStringToInt(t1.legacyCSVVarcharCol, ',')
    )

--works everywhere:

SELECT t1.*   
FROM usertable t1
WHERE 1 in 
    ( Select val 
      from 
      fnSplitStringToInt('1,4,543,56578', ',')
    )
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the only difference is the first argument to fnSplitStringToInt is a column in the case that fails in 2k and a literal string in the case that succeeds in both.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I've always had problems with OpenGL
  implementations from Intel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is kind of what I'm worried about, but I have a hard time believing they'd screw up something as basic as glDrawPixels, and also, since I can "duplicate" the problem by changing the raster position vector, it makes me think it's my fault and I'm missing something basic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think you're running into some
  byte-order issues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was my first inclination, and I've tried packing differently, with no result. I also tried packing the buffer with values that would present a usable alpha if swizzled, with no result. This is why I'm barking up the raster pos tree, but I'm still honestly not 100% sure. Note that I'm targeting only Intel Macs if that makes a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the link, it was a good read, and good to tuck away for future reference. I'd upmod but I can't until I get 3 more rep points :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we discussed before, make sure the .aspx file is empty of any markup other than the @Page declaration.  That can sometimes trigger page buffering when it wouldn't have normally happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, point the tech support guys to that file and describe the desired behavior (10 updates, 1 per second).  I've found that giving them a simple test case goes a long way toward getting these things resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely let us know what it ends up being.  I'm guessing some sort of inline caching or reverse proxy, but I'm curious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use Guides in Photoshop (and lock to them).  Figure out all of your dimensions for each box/ region ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collect all of your dimensions and color hex values into an info file (I use a txt file) that you can easily reference.  This will reduce your alt-tab tax and selecting colors in Photoshop multiple times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all my Guides are in place, I slice out the entire website into my images folder, starting with photos and grouped elements, and ending with the various background tiles/images, should they exist. (Tip: Use ctrl-click on the layer preview to select that layer's content).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes on using Photoshop: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Guides or the Grid. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the Notes feature for any pertinent information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always use Layer Groups for similar elements.  We need to be able to turn entire regions off in one click.  Put all 'header' content in one Layer Group. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always name your layers.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can put each page template in one PSD file and use nested Layer Groups to organize them.  This way we don't have to setup all of our guides and notes for each page template on a site.  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago while adding a new case to a switch I forgot to end the case with a break. Once I found the error I changed the indentation of my switch statement from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;switch(var) {
   case CONST1:
      statement;
      statement;
      statement;

   case CONST2:

      statement;
      statement;
   case CONST3:
      statement;
      statement;
      break;  
   default:
      statement;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(which is how guess most people would normally indent)
to this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;switch(var) {
   case CONST1:
      statement;
      statement;
      statement;
   break;  
   case CONST2:
      statement;
      statement;
      statement;
   case CONST3:
      statement;
      statement;
   break;  
   default:
      statement;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the missing break stand out, and to make me more likely not to forget to add one when I'm adding a new case. (of course you can't do this if your breaking conditionally in more than one place, which I've done on occasion)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I'm only doing something trivial like setting a variable or calling functions from the case statements then I often structure them like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;switch(var) {
   case CONST1: func1();  break;  
   case CONST2: func2();  break;  
   case CONST3: func3();  break;  
   default: statement;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That makes it super obvious if you miss a break. If your statements aren't the same length add whitespace till the breaks align, along with anything else that makes sense:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;switch(var) {
   case CONST1:          func1("Wibble", 2);  break;  
   case CONST2: longnamedfunc2("foo"   , 3);  break;  
   case CONST3: variable = 2;                 break;  
   default: statement;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although if I'm passing the same parameters to each function I would use a function pointer (the following is actual code from a work project):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;short (*fnExec) ( long nCmdId

&lt;p&gt;For weakly typed languages or languages with dynamic scope (PHP, JavaScript), functional contracts are also very handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For everything else, I would toss it aside an rely upon beta testers and unit tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1190/gaius" rel="nofollow"&gt;Gaius&lt;/a&gt;: A Null Pointer exception gets thrown for you automatically by the runtime, there is no benefit to testing that stuff in the function prologue. If you are more interested in documentation, then I would use annotations that can be used with static analyzers and the like (to make sure the code isn't breaking your annotations for example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A stronger type system coupled with Design by Contract seems to be the way to go. Take a look at &lt;a href="http://research.microsoft.com/SpecSharp/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Spec#&lt;/a&gt; for an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Spec# programming language.  Spec#
  is an extension of the object-oriented
  language C#.  It extends the type
  system to include non-null types and
  checked exceptions.  It provides
  method contracts in the form of pre-
  and postconditions as well as object
  invariants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that there's also:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" rel="nofollow"&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt; visual editor (&lt;a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/gui_builder.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;flash demo of the features&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and Eclipse's &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/vep/WebContent/main.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;Visual Editor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I've used Netbeans' and IDEA's visual editors. Both are nice but I thought Netbeans had a leg up because it doesn't use any proprietary way of saving the GUI structure and instead does something similar to what Visual Studio does - auto-generating the code that you can then add to. IDEA stores the information in a separate file which means you have to use IDEA to edit the layout visually later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not used Eclipse's Visual Editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My vote is for Netbeans' visual editor. I think it satisfies what most people are looking for in a visual editor and leaves it flexible enough to plug the holes manually through code without affecting the visual editor (so you can switch back and forth between code and design views without breaking either).&lt;/p&gt;

I was in my very first programming class(VB6) and the Prof had just taught us about random numbers and he gave the following instructions: "Create a virtual lottery machine. Imagine a glass ball full of 100 ping pong balls marked 0 to 99. Pick them randomly and display their number until they have all been selected, no duplicates."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone else wrote their program like this: Pick a ball, put its number into an "already selected list" and then pick another ball. Check to see if its already selected, if so pick another ball, if not put its number on the "already selected list" etc....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course by the end they were making hundreds of comparisons to find the few balls that had not already been picked. It was like throwing the balls back into the jar after selecting them. My revelation was to throw balls away after picking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this sounds mind-numbingly obvious but this was the moment that the "programming switch" got flipped in my head. This was the moment that programming went from trying to learn a strange foreign language to trying to figure out an enjoyable puzzle. And once I made that mental connection between programming and fun there was really no stopping me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, security is not an issue in the choice. You should have security check on server when you execute an action. Which code decides to show/hide the button that leads to the action is irrelevant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That leaves us with only one drawback of doing show/hide logic in Javascript - the HTML sent to user is bigger than necessary. This may not be a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having show/hide logic in PHP does have a minus, though. The PHP code required is usually a &lt;a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001155.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;tag soup&lt;/a&gt;. Akira's code provides a good example of how it is usually done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corresponding Javascript code would probably look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (logged())
    {
    elementSecretArea.style.display = "list-item";
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(assuming that elements that could be hidden have display:none by default).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This style also allows nice "Ajax" scenario: user sees a page w/o secret area, inputs password, sees the secret area all without refreshing the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you already have a script that runs when your document load for other reasons, I would seriously consider having show/hide logic there.&lt;/p&gt;

The NoneType probably returns identity for equality. Since None is the only instance you can make of NoneType (I think this is true), the two operations are the same. In the case of other types this is not always the case. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]
if list1==list2: print "Equal"
if list1 is list2: print "Same"

&lt;p&gt;On the browser side, the JavaScript code has the class (or was it the object), followed by "::", followed by the method name:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function Uploader::MyUpdate()
{
    // ... code to fetch the current state of various

I found &lt;a href="http://www.erasme.org/pl-sql-library-for-JSON"&gt;one PL/SQL library&lt;/a&gt; for auto-generating JSON, but it doesn't do exactly everything I need it too.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The system, which has been in production for 8+ years, was architected to use PL/SQL for the CRUDs and most of the business logic. The PL/SQL also generates 90% of the presentation layer (HTML/JavaScript), using mod PL/SQL. The other 10% is report data done via Oracle Reports Builder.&lt;/p&gt;

ListObjects will automatically re-size on binding, as long as they do not affect any other objects on the sheet.  Keep in mind that ListObjects can only affect the Ranges which they wrap around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, the list object which was above the other one had fewer columns than the one below it.  Let's say the top ListObject had 2 columns, and the bottom ListObject had 3 columns.  When the top ListObject changed its number of rows, it had no ability to make any changes to the third column since it wasn't in it's underlying Range.  This means that it couldn't shift any cells in the third column, and so the second ListObject couldn't be properly moved, resulting in my exception above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing the positions of the ListObjects to place the wider one above the smaller one works fine.  Following the logic above, this now means that the wider ListObject can shift all of the columns of the second ListObject, and since there is nothing below the smaller one it can also shift any cells necessary.  The reason I wasn't having any trouble on the initial binding is that both ListObjects were a single cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is not optimal in my case, I will probably use empty columns or try to play around with invisible columns if that's possible, but at least the cause is now clear.&lt;/p&gt;

It's simply a paradigm; an ideal that you should have in the back of your mind when designing classes. Avoid mixing code from the three categories into one class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, while a table grid &lt;em&gt;view&lt;/em&gt; should obviously present data once shown, it should not have code on where to retrieve the data from, or what its native structure (the &lt;em&gt;model&lt;/em&gt;) is like. Likewise, while it may have a function to sum up a column, the actual summing is supposed to happen in the &lt;em&gt;controller&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 'save file' dialog (&lt;em&gt;view&lt;/em&gt;) ultimately passes the path, once picked by the user, on to the &lt;em&gt;controller&lt;/em&gt;, which then asks the &lt;em&gt;model&lt;/em&gt; for the data, and does the actual saving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This separation of responsibilities allows flexibility down the road. For example, because the view doesn't care about the underlying model, supporting multiple file formats is easier: just add a model subclass for each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The listener is definitely added before the web service call, here is an example of what my code look like (I simplified lots of things...):&lt;/p&gt;

public class FooComboBox extends ComboBox
{
    private var service:HTTPService = null;
    public function ProjectAutoComplete()
    {
        service = new HTTPService();
        service.url = Application.application.poxmlUrl;
        service.addEventListener(FaultEvent.FAULT,serviceFault);
        service.addEventListener(ResultEvent.RESULT,resultReturned);


        this.addEventListener(FlexEvent.DATA_CHANGE,dataChange);
    }
    public function init():void
    {
        var postdata:Object = {};
        postdata["key"] = "ProjectName";
        postdata["accountId"] = Application.application.accountId
        service.send(postdata);
    }
    private function resultReturned(event:ResultEvent):void
    {
        this.dataProvider = service.lastResult.Array.Element;
        // thought I could do it here...but no luck...
    }
    private function dataChange(e:FlexEvent):void
    {
        // combobox has been databound
        mx.controls.Alert.show("databound!");
    }
    ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then in a mxml file I have the FooComboBox with id "foo" and I call:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
foo.init();
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to execute some code after the combobox is &lt;strong&gt;completely&lt;/strong&gt; databound...any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;

Some are inadvisable to use in certain ways (i.e. using Request or Application scope inside your Custom Tags or CFC's; this is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_%28computer_science%29"&gt;coupling&lt;/a&gt;, violates encapsulation principles, and is considered a bad practice), and some have special purposes: Cookie is persisted on the client machine as physical cookies, and Session scoped variables are user-specific and expire with the user's session on the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a variable is extremely unlikely to change (constant for all intents and purposes) and can simply be initialized on application startup and never written again, generally you should put it into Application scope because this persists it between every user and every session. When properly implemented it is written once and read N times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proper implementation of Application variables in Application.cfm might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;cfif not structKeyExists(application, "dsn")&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;cflock scope="application" type="exclusive" timeout="30"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;cfif not structKeyExists(application, "dsn")&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;cfset application.dsn = "MyDSN" /&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;cfset foo = "bar" /&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;cfset x = 5 /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/cfif&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/cflock&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/cfif&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the existence of the variable in the application scope is checked before and after the lock, so that if two users create a race condition at application startup, only one of them will end up setting the application variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit of this approach is that it won't constantly refresh these stored variables on every request, wasting the user's time and the server's processing cycles. The trade-off is that it is a little verbose and complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was greatly simplified with the addition of Application.cfc. Now, you can specify which variables are created on application startup and don't have to worry about locking and checking for existence and all of that fun stuff:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;cfcomponent&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;cfset this.name = "myApplicationName" /&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;cffunction name="onApplicationStart" returnType="boolean" output="false"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;cfset application.dsn = "MyDSN" /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;cfset foo = "bar" /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;cfset x = 5 /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;cfreturn true /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/cffunction&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/cfcomponent&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information on Application.cfc including all of the various special functions available and every little detail about what and how to use it, &lt;a href="http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/index.cfm/2007/11/9/Applicationcfc-Methods-and-Example-Uses"&gt;I recommend this post on Raymond Camden's blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, request scope is available everywhere in your code, but that doesn't necessarily make it "right" to use it everywhere. Chances are that your predecessor was using it to break encapsulation, and that can be cumbersome to refactor out. You may be best off leaving it as-is, but understanding which scope is the best tool for the job will definitely make your future code better.&lt;/p&gt;

If objects (chuncks of memory) are shared among threads and synchronization (critical section, mutex, semaphore, other) primitives are not on per-class (per-object, per-class) basis, then it is possible to come to a situation where class (chunk of memory) is deleted / freed while in use, or used after deleted / freed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a test for that, you could add synchronization primitives to each class and method. This will make your code slower because many objects will have to wait for each other, but if this eliminates the heap corruption, your heap-corruption problem will become a code optimization one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the code is already loaded and you need to find a non-intrusive way to re-load the application.   Recycling app-pools is an effective way to do this.   If you are on the old IIS that doesn't have app-pools, then updating the last-modified in the /bin/ folders or web.config files will reload the application without affecting the other sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflection works with assemblys and types mainly so you'll have to get all the types of the assembly and query them for the right interface. Here's an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Assembly asm = Assembly.Load("MyAssembly");
Type[] types = asm.GetTypes();
Type[] result = types.where(x =&amp;gt; x.GetInterface("IMyInterface") != null);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That will get you all the types that implement the IMyInterface in the Assembly MyAssembly&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a big fan of Perforce, and moving from SourceSafe it will seem like Nirvana. Just getting atomic checkin will be a big boost for your company. Otherwise, Perforce is fast, it has good tools, and the workflow is simple for doing things like merges and integrations. I wholeheartedly recommend it.  It may not be all new and flashy like the latest distributed VCS's, but honestly, I prefer the client/server model for its speed, especially if you're working with people in other countries that may have slow connections to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Visual Studio integration is pretty good, but it has a few irritating issues. If you run another Perforce client at the same time (like P4V), it's very poor at keeping changes from the other client in sync in terms of showing what files are currently checked in/out. You generally have to shut down Visual Studio and load the project again if you want it to sync correctly. But, the sync status doesn't actually affect checkins/checkouts/updates from working correctly, it just means you can be fooled in to thinking something is in a different state than it actually is while you're in Visual Studio. The Perforce clients will always show the correct status as they sync continually with the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, on occasion you'll find you need to work "offline" (not connected to the Perforce database for some reason) and when you load the project again the next time, your Perforce bindings may be lost and you'll have to rebind each project individually. If you work with a solution that contains many projects this can be a big pain in the patoot. Same goes for when you first check out a solution, binding to Perforce is needed before the integration occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

written a UITypeEditor. So far, all works just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extender also has a couple of properties itself, which I am trying to 
use as a sort of default for the UITypeEditor. What I want to do is to be 
able to set a property on the extender itself (not the extended controls), 
and when I open up the UITypeEditor for one of the additional properties on 
an extended control, I want to set a value in the UITypeEditor to the value 
of the property on the extender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple example: The ExtenderProvider has a property DefaultExtendedValue. On the form I set the value of this property to "My Value". Extended controls have, through the provider, a property ExtendedValue with a UITypeEditor. When I open the editor for the property ExtendedValue the default (initial) value should be set to "My Value".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that the best place to do this would be 
UITypeEditor.EditValue, just before calling 
IWindowsFormsEditorService.DropDownControl or .ShowDialog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only problem is that I can't (or I haven't discovered how to) get hold 
of the extender provider itself in EditValue, to read the value of the property in question and set it in the UITypeEditor. Context gives me the extended 
control, but that is of no use to me in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tend to use the Perforce GUI for many operations (submits, diffs) just because it's quicker/better, but the process of the IDE checking things out is seamless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perforce in my experience is rock-solid and the best mixed (code+data) version control product out their if cost is not a factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest gripe is that the performance of the server under Windows is no where near as good as under *nix, and if you are using a *nix server they do not officially support the option for case-insensitive filenames (meaning you either forgo support relating to filesystem errors, or setup a trigger that prevents people adding foo.cpp if Foo.cpp exists). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other main compaint is that for some common operations you have to revert to the command line, often piping functions together. One example would be getting a list of files in a directory that are not under source-control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these are issues that reflect more on the company than the product though. IMO Perforce know they're at the top of the market and thus see no reason to invest in fixing things like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;XmlNode stuffChild = stuff.SelectSingleNode(".//stuffChild");

I can't really say what exactly without knowing the kinds of errors you're seeing. A rough guess would be that usec can never be &gt; 999999, so you're relying on overflow to know when to adjust sec. It could also just be a problem with your duration output format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway. Why not store the utime and stime components as float seconds rather than trying to build your own rusage on output? I'm pretty sure the following will give you proper seconds.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;static int timeval_diff_ms(timeval const&amp;amp; end, timeval const&amp;amp; start) {

&lt;p&gt;To make a type "nullable" append a question mark to the type, for example:    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int? value = 5;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also recommend using the "&lt;code&gt;as&lt;/code&gt;" keyword instead of casting. You can only use the "as" keyword on nullable types, so make sure you're casting things that are already nullable (like strings) or you use nullable types as mentioned above. The reasoning for this is &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a type is nullable, the "&lt;code&gt;as&lt;/code&gt;" keyword returns &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; if a value is &lt;code&gt;DBNull&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's &lt;a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/8052/Type-casting-impact-over-execution-performance-in" rel="nofollow"&gt;ever-so-slightly faster than casting&lt;/a&gt; though &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/496167/392"&gt;only in certain cases&lt;/a&gt;. This on its own is never a good enough reason to use &lt;code&gt;as&lt;/code&gt;, but coupled with the reason above it's useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd recommend doing something like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;DataRow row = ds.Tables[0].Rows[0];
string value = row as string;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case above, if &lt;code&gt;row&lt;/code&gt; comes back as &lt;code&gt;DBNull&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; will become &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; instead of throwing an exception. Be aware that if your DB query changes the columns/types being returned, &lt;strong&gt;using &lt;code&gt;as&lt;/code&gt; will cause your code to silently fail&lt;/strong&gt; and make values simple &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; instead of throwing the appropriate exception when incorrect data is returned so it is recommended that you have tests in place to validate your queries in other ways to ensure data integrity as your codebase evolves.&lt;/p&gt;

    ## When coming back from the CAS server a ticket is provided in the QUERY_STRING
    print "QUERY_STRING = " . $id . "&amp;lt;/br&amp;gt;\n";
    ## $ST should contain the received Service Ticket
    my $ST = $q-&amp;gt;param('ticket');
    my $user = $cas-&amp;gt;validateST($target, $ST);  #### This is what fails

    printf "Error: %s\n", &amp;amp;AuthCAS::get_errors() unless (defined $user);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My advice to you for planning something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Avoid making a computer game&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A computer game, while fun to build, doesn't reward the programmer with results early on (it's very complex). You want to concentrate on small but useful application programs, such as a &lt;a href="http://www.stromcode.com/2008/03/01/cwin32-tutorials/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Port Scanner&lt;/a&gt;. The example there is a little complex, but it's one of the best learning projects I've seen on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Teach graphics early&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's rewarding to see the fruits of your labors early on, and it motivates you to go further. Whether you're using WinForms, MFC or the Win32 API, OpenGL or DirectX, teach it early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Many small lessons with in depth information&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This principle is followed by the above linked Port Scanner project, and it works well. Teach each part thoroughly, and give time for the beginner to absorb the lesson. I think that &lt;a href="http://zophusx.byethost11.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;ZophusX&lt;/a&gt; had a good format for giving the information. It's too bad he's mostly abandoned his site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) It takes time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't rush things. Nobody becomes a stellar programmer in a few weeks. Try and make the lessons simple, but engaging, and keep building from your previous lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Get feedback early and often&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might think a project is incredibly interesting, or a particular lesson or such, but you aren't the one learning. Your student(s) will greatly appreciate it when you ask them early on how things are going, and what they'd like to know more about. Be flexible enough that you can accomodate some of those requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) Have fun teaching&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have fun. Passion is contagious, and if your student(s) see how much you enjoy the subject matter, some of that enthusiasm will rub off on them as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that helps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a development machine your best bet is an imaging solution that offers as near a "one-click-restore" process as possible. TimeMachine (Mac) and Windows Home Server (Windows) are both excellent for this purpose. Not only can you have your entire machine restored in 1-2 hours (depending on HDD size), but both run automatically and store deltas so you can have months of backups in relatively little space. There are also numerous "ghosting" packages, though they usually do not offer incremental/delta backups so take more time/space to backup your machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less good are products such as Carbonite/Mozy/JungleDisk/RSync. These products WILL allow you to retrieve your data, but you will still have to reinstall the OS and programs. Some have limited/no histories either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of backing up your code and data then I would recommend a sourcecode control product like SVN. While a general backup solution will protect your data, it does not offer the labeling/branching/history functionality that SCC packages do. These functions are invaluable for any type of project with a shelf-life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can easily run a SVN server on your local machine. If your machine is backed up then your SVN database will be also. This IMO is the best solution for a home developer and is how I keep things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are screen readers really so primitive that they would read text that isn't even displayed on the screen?  Ideally, couldn't you make a screen reader that waited until the page was finished loading, applied all css, and even ran Javascript onload functions before it figured out what was actually displayed, and then read that off to the user?  You could probably even identify parts of the page that are menus or table of contents, and give some sort of easy way for those parts to be read exclusively or skipped over. I would think that the programming community could come up with a better solution to this problem.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being able to tease these components apart makes the code easier to re-use and independently test. If you don't actually know what MVC is, be careful about trying to understand people's opinions as there is still some contention about what the "Model" is (whether it is the business objects/DataSets/DataTables or if it represents the underlying service layer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've seen all sorts of implementations that call themselves MVC but aren't exactly and as the comments in &lt;a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001112.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jeff's article&lt;/a&gt; show MVC is a contentious point that I don't think developers will ever fully agree upon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without this fundamental segregation of the design "components" the adoption of these techniques would be much more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it helps to make your code even more interface-based.. Not only within the individual project, but you can almost start to develop common "views" which mean you can template lot more of the "grunt" code used in your applications. For example, a very abstract "data view" which simply takes a bunch of data and throws it to a common grid layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can select a report using two methods. With &lt;code&gt;SelectedReport=MyReport&lt;/code&gt; in the query string, or by selecting it from a dropdown. And it's a common case for them to come to the page with SelectedReport in the query string, and then change the report selected in the drop down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is, is there anyway of making the dropdown modify the query string when it's selected. So I'd want &lt;code&gt;SelectedReport=MyNewReport&lt;/code&gt; in the query string and the page to post back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment it's just doing a normal postback, which leaves the &lt;code&gt;SelectedReport=MyReport&lt;/code&gt; in the query string, even if it's not the currently selected report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; And I also need to preserve ViewState.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've tried doing &lt;code&gt;Server.Transfer(Request.Path + "?SelectedReport=" + SelectedReport, true)&lt;/code&gt; in the event handler for the Dropdown, and this works function wise, unfortunately because it's a Server.Transfer (to preserve ViewState) instead of a Response.Redirect the URL lags behind what's shown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I'm asking the impossible or going about it completely the wrong way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@Craig&lt;/strong&gt; The QueryString collection is read-only and cannot be modified.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;@Jason&lt;/strong&gt; That would be great, except I'd lose the ViewState wouldn't I? (Sorry I added that after seeing your response).&lt;/p&gt;

The real trick though is making your applications aware of the scrambling algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the environment variables in &lt;code&gt;~/.profile&lt;/code&gt; you could store them encoded and then decode them before setting the variables, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;

creds=`echo "$encodedcreds" | tr n-za-mN-ZA-M a-zA-Z`

For Python 2.7 and above, &lt;code&gt;argparse&lt;/code&gt; replaces &lt;code&gt;optparse&lt;/code&gt;. See &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3217673/why-use-argparse-rather-than-optparse"&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As other people pointed out, you are better off going with optparse over getopt.  getopt is pretty much a one-to-one mapping of the standard getopt(3) C library functions, and not very easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;optparse, while being a bit more verbose, is much better structured and simpler to extend later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a typical line to add an option to your parser:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;parser.add_option('-q', '--query',
            action="store", dest="query",
            help="query string", default="spam")
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It pretty much speaks for itself; at processing time, it will accept -q or --query as options, store the argument in an attribute called query and has a default value if you don't specify it.  It is also self-documenting in that you declare the help argument (which will be used when run with -h/--help) right there with the option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually you parse your arguments with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;options, args = parser.parse_args()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will, by default, parse the standard arguments passed to the script (sys.argv[1:])&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;options.query will then be set to the value you passed to the script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You create a parser simply by doing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;parser = optparse.OptionParser()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all the basics you need.  Here's a complete Python script that shows this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import optparse

parser = optparse.OptionParser()

parser.add_option('-q', '--query',
    action="store", dest="query",
    help="query string", default="spam")

options, args = parser.parse_args()

I find it unfortunate that people are still preaching this as a pattern (View in charge) as opposed to an anti-pattern as it contradicts "It's just a view" (Pragmatic Programmer). "It's just a view" states that the final view shown to the user is a secondary concern of the application. Microsoft's MVP pattern renders re-use of Views much more difficult and &lt;em&gt;conveniently&lt;/em&gt; excuses Microsoft's designer from encouraging bad practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be perfectly frank, I think the underlying concerns of MVC hold true for any MVP implementation and the differences are almost entirely semantic. As long as you are following separation of concerns between the view (that displays the data), the controller (that initialises and controls user interaction) and the model (the underlying data and/or services)) then you are acheiving the benefits of MVC. If you are acheiving the benefits then who really cares whether your pattern is MVC, MVP or Supervising Controller? The only &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; pattern remains as MVC, the rest are just differing flavours of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider &lt;a href="http://www.aspiringcraftsman.com/2007/08/interactive-application-architecture/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; highly exciting article that comprehensively lists a number of these differing implementations. 
You may note that they're all basically doing the same thing but slightly differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally think MVP has only been recently re-introduced as a catchy term to either reduce arguments between semantic bigots who argue whether something is truly MVC or not or to justify Microsofts Rapid Application Development tools. Neither of these reasons in my books justify its existence as a separate design pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

As a few people have stated subsequently Dispose and implementing IDisposable has nothing to do with freeing the memory associated with a .NET class. It is mainly and traditionally used to free unmanaged resources such as file handles etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While your application can call GC.Collect() to try to force a collection by the garbage collector this will only really have an effect on those items that are at the correct generation level in the freachable queue. So it is possible that if you have cleared all references to the object it might still be a couple of calls to GC.Collect() before the actual memory is freed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't say in your question WHY you feel the need to free up memory immediately. I understand that sometimes there can be unusual circumstances but seriously, in managed code it is almost always best to let the runtime deal with memory management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the best advice if you think your code is using up memory quicker than the GC is freeing it then you should review your code to ensure that no objects that are no longer needed are referenced in any data structures you have lying around in static members etc. Also try to avoid situations where you have circular object references as it is possible that these may not be freed either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if(slPlugin.isVersionSupported("2.0")) {
  alert("I haz some flavour of Silverlight 2");
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can be as specific as you want when checking the build, since the version string can include all of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;major - the major number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;minor - the minor number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build - the build number&lt;/li&gt;

The idea is that you shouldn't be programming against specific versions of Silverlight. Rather, you should be checking if the client has &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; verion 1.0, or 2.0, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, you can get the Silverlight version number in Firefox by checking the Silverlight plugin description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;alert(navigator.plugins["Silverlight Plug-In"].description);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shows '2.0.30523.8' on my computer.&lt;/p&gt;

While I'm not a fan of this statement in real life, it does apply in a lot of cases.  Usually you want to avoid code that chains two system calls on the same file, because you never know what will happen to the file in between your two calls in your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A typical mistake is to write something like&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if os.path.exists(path):
    os.unlink(path)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second call (os.unlink) may fail if something else deleted it after your if test, raise an Exception, and stop the rest of your function from executing.  (You might think this doesn't happen in real life, but we just fished another bug like that out of our codebase last week - and it was the kind of bug that left a few programmers scratching their head and claiming 'Heisenbug' for the last few months)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in your particular case, I would probably do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;try:
    os.stat(path)
except OSError, e:
    if e.errno == errno.ENOENT:
        print 'path %s does not exist or is a broken symlink' % path
    else:
        raise e
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The annoyance here is that stat returns the same error code for a symlink that just isn't there and a broken symlink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I guess you have no choice than to break the atomicity, and do something like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if not os.path.exists(os.readlink(path)):
    print 'path %s is a broken symlink' % path

&lt;li&gt;lib, because they are libraries. However, 'lib' has a different connotation in UNIX-world.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I think you should just use SSL and rely on an HTTP client library that does caching (Ex: WinInet on windows). It's hard to imagine that the benifits of enterprise wide caching is worth the pain of writing a custom security encryption scheme or certificate fun on the proxy. Worse, on the encyrption scheme you mention, doing asynmetric ciphers on the entity body sounds like a huge perf hit on the server side of your application; there is a reason that SSL uses symmetric ciphers for the actual payload of the connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application concerned is not a browser app, it's a desktop app pulling data over the internet. What is going to happen is that all instances of the app will be pulling the same piece of at around about the same time. This data needs to be secured, but I'm hoping to increase perf by having some instances of the app get a cached version from the corporate proxy server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data chunks are small, but they may be requested frequently. Essentially all app instances are going to request the same data as each other at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data/message body on the server side will be pre-encrypted and cached in a distributed in-memory hash-table. Encryption will not be performed on a per-request basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm also investigating using a message bus, such as NServiceBus instead.&lt;/p&gt;

It's not the safest thing in the world, but if you have total control over your automated build machine; it's not too shabby. Quick and reusable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drop in the exe somewhere that does the recursive delete:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;
static void Main(string[] args)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
        for (int n = 0; n &amp;lt; args.Length; n++)

            if (Directory.Exists(args[n].ToString()))

                Directory.Delete(args[n].ToString(), true);
            }

        }


}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Drop it in somewhere multiple files can pass arguments to it and just write a custom .bat file for each project. So my task block looks like this:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;tasks&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;msbuild&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;executable&amp;gt;C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5\MSBuild.exe&amp;lt;/executable&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;workingDirectory&amp;gt;Z:\WorkingDirectory&amp;lt;/workingDirectory&amp;gt;

     &amp;lt;logger&amp;gt;C:\Program Files\CruiseControl.NET\server\ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MsBuild.dll&amp;lt;/logger&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/msbuild&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;exec&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;executable&amp;gt;Z:\SomePathToBuildScripts\YourCustomBat.bat&amp;lt;/executable&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/exec&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tasks&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Then the final step is setting up that .bat file to perform the delete/rebuild functions after use. In the bat file just make sure you rebuild ("MD") the directories you deleted if youexpect to publish a site back to them. On our dev boxes I found this to be the best way to prevent the beloved Frankenbuild.&lt;/p&gt;

It's just an query language that has a boat-load of syntac sugar to make it look SQL-ish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the very basic of basic examples, NHibernate and LINQ to SQL seem to both be solving the same problem.  Once you get pass that you soon realize that NHibernate has support for a lot of features that allow you to create truly rich domain models.

The benefits of using this pattern are that it's quick and easy to implement and it takes very little effort to get your domain running based on an existing database structure.  For simple applications, this is perfectly acceptable (and oftentimes even preferable), but for more complex applications devs will often suggest using a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_driven_design"&gt;domain driven design&lt;/a&gt; pattern instead (which is what NHibernate facilitates).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with the table-per-class pattern is that your database structure has a direct influence over your domain design.  For instance, let's say you have a Customers table with the following columns to hold a customer's primary address information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;StreetAddress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;City&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;State&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let's say you want to add columns for the customer's mailing address as well so you add in the following columns to the Customers table:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MailingStreetAddress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MailingCity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MailingState&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MailingZip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using LINQ to SQL, the Customer object in your domain would now have properties for each of these eight columns.  But if you were following a domain driven design pattern, you would probably have created an Address class and had your Customer class hold two Address properties, one for the mailing address and one for their current address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's a simple example, but it demonstrates how the table-per-class pattern can lead to a somewhat smelly domain.  In the end, it's up to you.  Again, for simple apps that just need basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality, LINQ to SQL is ideal because of simplicity.  But personally I like using NHibernate because it facilitates a cleaner domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: @lomaxx - Yes, the example I used was simplistic and could have been optimized to work well with LINQ to SQL.  I wanted to keep it as basic as possible to drive home the point.  The point remains though that there are several scenarios where having your database structure determine your domain structure would be a bad idea, or at least lead to suboptimal OO design.&lt;/p&gt;

See &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21593/what-is-the-difference-between-include-filename-and-include-filename" rel="nofollow"&gt;this other question&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the difference.  In short, config.h is typically included with quotes, not angle brackets, and this should make the preprocessor prefer the config.h from the project's own directory (which is usually what you want)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You say that a subproject should be including the enclosing project's config.h  Normally this is not at all what you want.  The subproject is standalone, and its PACKAGE and VERSION should be the one of that subproject, not yours.  If you include libxml in your xmlreader project for example, you would still want the libxml code to be compiled with PACKAGE libxml and VERSION (whatever the libxml version is).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is usually a big mistake to have config.h be included from public headers.  config.h is always private to your project or the subproject, and should only be included from .c files.  So, if your vendor's documentation says to include their "vendor.h" and that public header includes config.h somehow, then that is a no-no.  Similarly, if your project is a library, don't include config.h anywhere from your publically installed headers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately there is no way to get around this in a strongly typed language.  You won't be able to ensure at compile time that the classes will be able to be instantiated by your Activator-based code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(ed: removed an erroneous alternative solution)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is that, unfortunately, it's not possible to use interfaces, abstract classes, or virtual methods in combination with either constructors or static methods.  The short reason is that the former contain no explicit type information, and the latter require explicit type information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constructors and static methods &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; have explicit (right there in the code) type information available at the time of the call.  This is required because there is no instance of the class involved which can be queried by the runtime to obtain the underlying type, which the runtime needs to determine which actual concrete method to call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire point of an interface, abstract class, or virtual method is to be able to make a function call &lt;strong&gt;without&lt;/strong&gt; explicit type information, and this is enabled by the fact that there is an instance being referenced, which has "hidden" type information not directly available to the calling code.  So these two mechanisms are quite simply mutually exclusive.  They can't be used together because when you mix them, you end up with no concrete type information at all anywhere, which means the runtime has no idea where to find the function you're asking it to call.&lt;/p&gt;

When you catch exceptions, you don't distinguish different instances, like you would normally do with objects, therefore you need different subtypes. Using too many custom exceptions is a case which I see hardly occurring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One advice would be to create exceptions as needed, and if it becomes apparent that one exception type is a duplicate of another, refactor the code by merging the two. Of course it helps if some thought goes into structuring exceptions from the beginning. But generally, use custom exceptions for all cases that have no 1:1 correspondence to existing, situation-specific exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

TeamWare is a fully distribution solution using SCCS as the local repository file revision system and then wrappers that with a set of tools to handle the merging operations (done through branch renaming) back to the centralized repositories of which there can be many. In fact, because it is distributed, there really is no master repository per se' (except by convention if you want it) and all users have their own copies of the entire source tree and revisions. During "put back" operations, the merge tool using 3-way diffs algorithmically sorts out what is what and allows you combine the changes from different developers that have accumulated over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After switching to Windows for our development platform, we ended up switching to &lt;a href="http://www.accurev.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;AccuRev&lt;/a&gt;. While AccuRev, because it depends on a centralized server, is not truely a distributed solution, logically from a workflow model comes very close. Where TeamWare would have had completely seperate copies of everything at each client, including all the revisions of all files, under AccuRev this is maintained in the central database and the local client machines only have the flat file current version of things for editing locally. However these local copies can be versioned through the client connection to the server and tracked completely seperately from any other changes (ie: branches) implicitly created by other developers &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think the distributed model implemented by TeamWare or the sort of hybrid model implemented by AccuRev is superior to completely centralized solutions. The main reason for this is that there is no notion of having to check out a file or having a file locked by another user. Also, users don't have to create or define the branches; the tools do this for you implicitly. When there are larger teams or different teams contributing to or maintaining a set of source files this resolves "tool generated" locking related collisions and allows the code changes to be coordinated more at the developer level who ultimately have to coordinate changes anyway. In a sense, the distributed model allows for a much finer grained "lock" rather than the course grained locking instituted by the centralized models.&lt;/p&gt;

The pattern I like involves creating 1 action for both the original render and re-render of the invalid form. It goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var form = new FooForm();

if (request.UrlReferrer == request.Url)
{
     // Fill form with previous request's data
}

if (Request.IsPost())
{
     if (!form.IsValid)
     {
         ViewData["ValidationErrors"] = ...
     } else {
         // update model
         model.something = foo.something;
         // handoff to post update action
         return RedirectToAction("ModelUpdated", ... etc);
     }
}

// By default render 1 view until form is a valid post
ViewData["Form"] = form;
return View();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's the pattern more or less. A little pseudoy. With this you can create 1 view to handle rendering the form, re-displaying the values (since the form will be filled with previous values), and showing error messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the posting to this action, if its valid it transfers control over to another action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Command-line tools are usually not interactive at all, while GUI's are.  This is a fundamental difference.  This is for example painful for long-running tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your command-line tool will at best print out some kind of progress information - newlines, a textual progress bar, a bunch of output, ... Any kind of error it can only output to the console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you want to slap a GUI on top of that, what do you do ? Parse the output of your long-running command line tool ? Scan for WARNING and ERROR in that output to throw up a dialog box ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At best, most UI's built this way throw up a pulsating busy bar for as long as the command runs, then show you a success or failure dialog when the command exits.  Sadly, this is how a lot of UNIX GUI programs are thrown together, making it a terrible user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most repliers here are correct in saying that you should probably abstract the actual functionality of your program into a library, then write a command-line interface and the GUI at the same time for it.  All your business logic should be in your library, and either UI (yes, a command line is a UI) should only do whatever is necessary to interface between your business logic and your UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A command line is too poor a UI to make sure you develop your library good enough for GUI use later.  You should start with both from the get-go, or start with the GUI programming.  It's easy to add a command line interface to a library developed for a GUI, but it's a lot harder the other way around, precisely because of all the interactive features the GUI will need (reporting, progress, error dialogs, i18n, ...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;check out all the files in a directory, so the app can modify them as necessary&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;mark as deleted files which are no longer there (since the app deleted them)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;manage this as one atomic change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local version control.&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes I'm working on something, and I want to keep a version history on it, but I'm not ready to push it to the central repositories.  With distributed VCS, I can just commit to my local repo until it's ready, without branching.  That way, if other people make changes that I need, I can still get them and integrate them into my code.  When I'm ready, I push it out to the servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fewer merge conflicts.&lt;/strong&gt; They still happen, but they seem to be less frequent, and are less of a risk, because all the code is checked in to my local repo, so even if I botch the merge, I can always back up and do it again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Separate repos as branches.&lt;/strong&gt; If I have a couple development vectors running at the same time, I can just make several clones of my repo and develop each feature independently.  That way, if something gets scrapped or slipped, I don't have to pull pieces out.  When they're ready to go, I just merge them together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speed.&lt;/strong&gt; Mercurial is much faster to work with, mostly because most of your common operations are local.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, like any new system, there was some pain during the transition.  You have to think about version control differently than you did when you were using SVN, but overall I think it's very much worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

        return ele.currentStyle["fontFamily"];
    } else if (document.defaultView) { // works in Opera and FF
        return document.defaultView.getComputedStyle(ele,null).getPropertyValue("font-family");
    } else {
        return null;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the CSS rule for this was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#fonttester {
    font-family: sans-serif, arial, helvetica;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it should return helvetica if that is installed, if not, arial, and lastly, the name of the system default sans-serif font. Note that the ordering of fonts in your CSS declaration is significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting hack you could also try is to create lots of hidden elements with lots of different fonts to try to detect which fonts are installed on a machine. I'm sure someone could make a nifty font statistics gathering page with this technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily, although that was my first thought, too. A code should always emphasize its function, especially if it has side effects. If the writer's intention was to emphasize the assignment to &lt;code&gt;sharedProxiesPref.disabled&lt;/code&gt; then hey, roll with it. On the other hand, it could have been clearer that the action taking place here is to disable the object, in which case the conditional block would have been better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've managed to crystallize my reluctance to do so into a simple parallel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Version Control can be used well or badly.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 'light side' of version control is when you use it to keep track of your changes, are able to go back to older versions when you break stuff, and when you publish your changes so your peers can see your work-in-progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 'dark side' of version control is when you don't use it properly so you don't 'checkpoint' your work by committing regularly, you keep a bunch of changes in your local checkout, and you don't share your changes with others as you make them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subversion makes both the light side and the dark side relatively hard.  All the basics work, but few people really use branching in Subversion (beyond tagging and releasing) because merging is not straightforward at all.  The support for it in Subversion itself is terrible, and there are scripts like svnmerge that make it better, but it's still not very good.  So, these days, with good branching and merging support considered more and more like the necessity it is for collaborative development, Subversion doesn't match up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the 'dark side' is pretty tough to follow too.  You only need to be bitten once by not having your local changes commited once in a while to the online repository, and breaking your code with a simple edit you don't even remember making.  So you end up making regular commits and people can see the work you're doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in the end Subversion ends up being a good middle-of-the-road VCS that, while a bit cumbersome for implementing the best practices, still makes it hard to get things very wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, with a DVCS the cost of either going completely light side or dark side is a lot lower.  Branching and merging is a lot simpler with these modern VCS systems.  But the distributed aspect makes it easy to work in a set of local branches on your own machine, giving you the granular commits you need to checkpoint your work, possibly without ever publishing your changes so others can see, review, and collaborate.  The friction of keeping your changes in your local branches and not publishing them is typically lower than publishing them in some branch on a publically available server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in a nutshell, here's the question: if I give our developers at work a DVCS, how can I make sure they use it to go to the 'light side', still publish their changes in a central location regularly, and make them understand that their one week local hack they didn't want to share yet might be just the thing some other developer could use to finish a feature while the first one is on holiday ? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If both the light side and the dark side of DVCS are so easy to get to, how do I keep them away from the dark side ?&lt;/p&gt;

If it is DBNull, then set your reference to what you use for null/empty for the corresponding datatype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;DataRow row = ds.Tables[0].Rows[0];
string value;

if (row["fooColumn"] == DBNull.Value)
{
   value = string.Empty;
}
else

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Manu said, you can create a convert class with an overloaded convert method per type so you don't have to pepper your code with if/else blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will however stress that nullable types is the better route to go if you can use them. The reasoning is that with non-nullable types, you are going to have to resort to "magic numbers" to represent null. For example, if you are mapping a column to an int variable, how are you going to represent DBNull? Often you can't use 0 because 0 has a valid meaning in most programs. Often I see people map DBNull to int.MinValue, but that could potentially be problematic too. My best advice is this: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For columns that can be null in the database, use nullable types.   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For columns that cannot be null in the database, use regular types.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nullable types were made to solve this problem. That being said, if you are on an older version of the framework or work for someone who doesn't grok nullable types, the code example will do the trick. &lt;/p&gt;

As for face-face or phone contact, if you're using Outlook I recommend that everything be handled via meeting requests.

   printf("%s - %s = %f\n", a, b, da-db);

   a = "500000000000002";
   b = "500000000000001";
   da = atof(a);
   db = atof(b);
   printf("%s - %s = %f\n", a, b, da-db);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you run this program, you get the following&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;   399999999999999 - 399999999999998 = 0.000000

A better term for the "dark side" you are describing is "the wrong way" of coding for a team. Source control is a tool used to facilitate collaborative work. If your team is not clear about the fact that the goal is to share the work, then the best reason to use source control is not even applicable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I think you might be a little confused about distributed source control. There is no publishing to a central locations. Some branches are more important than others and there exists many many branches. Keeping that in mind, I think that distributed source control really works best for popular open source projects. I'm under the perception that centralized source control is still better for development withing a company or some other clearly defined entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A stack, in this context, is the last in, first out buffer you place data while your program runs.  Last in, first out (LIFO) means that the last thing you put in is always the first thing you get back out - if you push 2 items on the stack, 'A' and then 'B', then the first thing you pop off the stack will be 'B', and the next thing is 'A'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you call a function in your code, the next instruction after the function call is stored on the stack, and any storage space that might be overwritten by the function call.  The function you call might use up more stack for its own local variables.  When it's done, it frees up the local variable stack space it used, then returns to the previous function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stack overflow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A stack overflow is when you've used up more memory for the stack than your program was supposed to use.  In embedded systems you might only have 256 bytes for the stack, and if each function takes up 32 bytes then you can only have function calls 8 deep - function 1 calls function 2 who calls function 3 who calls function 4 .... who calls function 8 who calls function 9, but function 9 overwrites memory outside the stack.  This might overwrite memory, code, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many programmers make this mistake by calling function A that then calls function B, that then calls function C, that then calls function A.  It might work most of the time, but just once the wrong input will cause it to go in that circle forever until the computer recognizes that the stack is overblown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recursive functions are also a cause for this, but if you're writing recursively (ie, your function calls itself) then you need to be aware of this and use static/global variables to prevent infinite recursion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, the OS and the programming language you're using manage the stack, and it's out of your hands.  You should look at your call graph (a tree structure that shows from your main what each function calls) to see how deep your function calls go, and to detect cycles and recursion that are not intended.  Intentional cycles and recursion need to be artificially checked to error out if they call each other too many times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond good programming practices, static and dynamic testing, there's not much you can do on these high level systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Embedded systems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the embedded world, especially in high reliability code (automotive, aircraft, space) you do extensive code reviews and checking, but you also do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disallow recursion and cycles - enforced by policy and testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep code and stack far apart (code in flash, stack in RAM, and never the twain shall meet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place guard bands around the stack - empty area of memory that you fill with a magic number (usually a software interrupt instruction, but there are many options here), and hundreds or thousands of times a second you look at the guard bands to make sure they haven't been overwritten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use memory protection (ie, no execute on the stack, no read or write just outside the stack)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interrupts don't call secondary functions - they set flags, copy data, and let the application take care of processing it (otherwise you might get 8 deep in your function call tree, have an interrupt, and then go out another few functions inside the interrupt, causing the blowout).  You have several call trees - one for the main processes, and one for each interrupt.  If your interrupts can interrupt each other... well, there be dragons...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;High-level languages and systems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in high level languages run on operating systems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce your local variable storage (local variables are stored on the stack - although compilers are pretty smart about this and will sometimes put big locals on the heap if your call tree is shallow)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid or strictly limit recursion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't break your programs up too far into smaller and smaller functions - even without counting local variables each function call consumes as much as 64 bytes on the stack (32 bit processor, saving half the CPU registers, flags, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your call tree shallow (similar to the above statement)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Web servers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It depends on the 'sandbox' you have whether you can control or even see the stack.  Chances are good you can treat web servers as you would any other high level language and operating system - it's largely out of your hands, but check the language and server stack you're using.  It &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; possible to blow the stack on your SQL server, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;while I agree that the problem is 'not sharing your work', the main argument is that tools promote a certain work flow and not all tools apply to all problems with equal friction.  My concern is that a DVCS makes it easier to not share your work since you don't have the drawbacks of not sharing your work you get with SVN.  If the friction of not sharing is lower than the friction of not sharing (which it is in DVCS), a developer, all else being equal, might easily choose the path of least friction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think I'm confused about distributed source control.  I know that there is no 'central location' by default.  But most projects using DVCS still have the concept of a 'master' branch at a 'central location' that they release from.  For the purpose of my question though, I only make the distinction between 'private' (only accessible by the developer) and 'public' (accessible by all other developers) branches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSS contains the aural media type specifically to control the "rendering" of things when screen readers are doing their work.  So, for you example, you would only set it as visible for the aural media type.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Ross&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm quite aware that the screen reader doesn't actually read the screen, but you would think that to work well, it would have to build a model of what a person with sight would see, otherwise, it seems like it would do a really poor job of getting across to the user what's actually on the page.  Also , putting things in the order you would read them doesn't really work, as a sighted person would scan the page quickly and read the section they want to read.  Do you put the contents first so that the user has to listen to them every time, or do you put them at the end so that they can get to the content first?  Also, putting content in order would mean some tricky CSS to get things positioned where you wanted them to be for sighted users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that most web pages contain very similar construction, and that it should be possible to, in many cases, pick out where the repeated headers and side columns are. When viewing many subsequent pages on the same site with the same formatting, it should be easy to figure out which sections are navigation, and which are content.  Doing this, the screen reader could completely skip the navigation sections, and move right onto the content, as most sighted users would do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize there are limitations, and that doing these types of things wouldn't be easy.  However, I feel like as far as screen readers go, we only did the bare minimum and left it at that. &lt;/p&gt;

Scott Guthrie has a &lt;a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/05/19/using-linq-to-sql-part-1.aspx"&gt;great series of posts on using Linq To SQL&lt;/a&gt; which I would strongly suggest you check out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think you could say Linq and NHibernate complement each other as that would imply that they could be used together, and whilst this is possible, you're much better off choosing one and sticking to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NHibernate allows you to map your database tables to your domain objects in a highly flexible way. It also allows you to use HBL to query the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linq to SQL also allows you to map your domain objects to the database however it use the Linq query syntax to query the database&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main difference here is that the Linq query syntax is &lt;strong&gt;checked at compile time by the compiler to ensure your queries are valid.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things to be aware of with linq is that it's only available in .net 3.x and is only supported in VS2008. NHibernate is available in 2.0 and 3.x as well as VS2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things to be aware of with NHibernate is that it does not generate your domain objects, nor does it generate the mapping files. You need to do this manually. Linq can&lt;br /&gt;
do this automatically for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best idea I can come up with is to "reuse" an iPhone app that records location and makes it accessible on the web. Take Twitter for example. If I'm not mistaken, Tapulous' app Twinkle will grab your location and post it to your Twitter.com user profile. Here's an example of what that looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aeKMV.png" alt="iPhone location"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From your webapp, you could then scrape the user page for each person whose location you're interested in. It's a pain in the butt, but like I said, this is the best I could come up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, if you don't want to mess with Twitter, there may be other apps out there that do this as well, but I don't personally know of any. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Nicks example from above heres how I would do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let Y = 0.3*R + 0.59*G + 0.11*B for
  each pixel&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;(R1,G1,B1) is what you are colorizing
  with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;protected LookupOp createColorizeOp(short R1, short G1, short B1) {
    short[] alpha = new short[256];
    short[] red = new short[256];
    short[] green = new short[256];
    short[] blue = new short[256];

    int Y = 0.3*R + 0.59*G + 0.11*B

    for (short i = 0; i &amp;lt; 256; i++) {
        alpha[i] = i;
        red[i] = (R1 + i*.3)/2;
        green[i] = (G1 + i*.59)/2;
        blue[i] = (B1 + i*.11)/2;
    }

    short[][] data = new short[][] {
            red, green, blue, alpha
    };

    LookupTable lookupTable = new ShortLookupTable(0, data);
    return new LookupOp(lookupTable, null);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It creates a &lt;a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/image/BufferedImageOp.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;BufferedImageOp&lt;/a&gt; that will mask out each color if the mask boolean is true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its simple to call too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;BufferedImageOp colorizeFilter = createColorizeOp(R1, G1, B1);
BufferedImage targetImage = colorizeFilter.filter(sourceImage, null);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is not what your looking for I suggest you look more into BufferedImageOp's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is would also be more efficient since you would not need to do the calculations multiple times on different images. Or do the calculations over again on different BufferedImages as long as the R1,G1,B1 values don't change.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead, there are two &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;msbuild&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements for the project, the first one calling a build target that runs &lt;a href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/contrib/client-side/svn-clean" rel="nofollow"&gt;svn-clean.pl&lt;/a&gt; (compiled to .exe), and then updates the source using svn.exe.  The second &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;msbuild&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element starts the main build process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can easily replace svn-clean with a delete command.  For my projects, deleting chaff from a checkout has always been faster than checking out a fresh working copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two msbuild elements are necessary because the main project build file is often updated. This is important because updates to your build file(s) will only be reloaded if you start a new msbuild process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This setup breaks down when I (very rarely) move or change the dependencies of that clean-and-update build target to the extent that the msbuild process would need to reload for valid instructions to run the clean-and-update target.  When this happens, I stop CC.Net before committing, go into the CC.Net server, and do an 'svn update' by hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sidelight: It could well be that CC.Net has a natural clean-before-build operation by now.  I've since moved to TeamCity, which is configurable to do this every build or only when the developer chooses (e.g., when you know you've made a change that would not update cleanly--svn moves of directories with build products comes to mind).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer the original question, one way you could do this, and mind you, this is a bit of a hack, simply &lt;a href="https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/blob/master/json2.js"&gt;serialize the two arrays to JSON&lt;/a&gt; and then compare the two JSON strings. That would simply tell you if the arrays are different, obviously you could do this to &lt;em&gt;each&lt;/em&gt; of the objects within the arrays as well to see which ones were different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option is to use a library which has some nice facilities for comparing objects - I use and recommend &lt;a href="http://www.mochikit.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MochiKit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27030/comparing-arrays-of-objects-in-javascript#27932"&gt;The answer kamens gave&lt;/a&gt; deserves consideration as well, since a single function to compare two given objects would be much smaller than any library to do what I suggest (although my suggestion would certainly work well enough).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a nave implemenation that may do just enough for you - be aware that there are potential problems with this implementation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function objectsAreSame(x, y) {
   var objectsAreSame = true;
   for(var propertyName in x) {
      if(x[propertyName] !== y[propertyName]) {
         objectsAreSame = false;
         break;
      }
   }
   return objectsAreSame;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assumption is that both objects have the same exact list of properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and it is probably obvious that, for better or worse, I belong to the only-one-return-point camp. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can throw different exceptions depending on the problem. e.g. Missing email address = ArgumentException. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then in the UI layer you can check the exception type and, if need be, the message and then display a appropriate message to the user. I personally tend to only show a informational message to the user if a certain type of exception is thrown (UserException in my app). Of course you should scrub and verify user input as much as possible further up the stack to make sure any exceptions are generated by truly unlikely scenarios, not as a filter for malformed emails which can easily be checked with a regex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wouldn't worry about the performance implications of catching an exception from user input. The only time you are going to see performance problems from exceptions is when they are being thrown and caught in a loop or similar.&lt;/p&gt;

What I need to do is make an Ajax callback every few minutes a user has been on the page. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don't need to do any DOM updates before, after, or during the callbacks. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don't need any information from the page, just from a site cookie which should always be sent with requests anyway, and an ID value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I'm curious to find out, is if there is any clean and simple way to make a JavaScript Ajax callback to an ASP.NET page without posting back the rest of the information on the page. I'd like to not have to do this if it is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really just want to be able to call a single method on the page, nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I'm restricted to ASP.NET 2.0 so I can't use any of the new 3.5 framework ASP AJAX features, although I can use the ASP AJAX extensions for the 2.0 framework.&lt;/p&gt;

Our site already uses jQuery for some things so I'll probably use jQuery for making requests since in my experience it seems to perform much better than ASP's AJAX framework does. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think would be the best method of transferring data to the IHttpHandler? Should I add variables to the query string or POST the data I need to send?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing I think I have to send is a single ID, but I can't decide what the best method is to send the ID and have the IHttpHandler handle it. I'd like to come up with a solution that would prevent a person with basic computer skills from accidentally or intentionally accessing the page directly or repeating requests. Is this possible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;jQuery lets you get the value using the val() method. Using it on the select tag you get the current selected option's value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$( '#mySelect' ).val(); //Gets the value for the current selected option

$( '#mySelect &amp;gt; option' ).each( function( index, option ) {
    option.val(); //The value for each individual option

Also, typically wouldn't an https session be short lived?  Connect, get your data, disconnect, whereas ssh would connect and persist for long periods of time?  I think perhaps using 443 instead of 22 might get past naive filters, but I don't think it would fool someone specifically looking for active attempts to bypass their filters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of my job I work with several live websites. We need an efficient means of maintaining backups of the live folders over time.  Additionally, updating these sites can be a pain, especially if a change happens to break in the live environment for whatever reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would be ideal would be hassle-free source control. I implemented SVN for a while which was great as a semi-solution for backup as well as revision control (easy reversion of temporary or breaking changes) etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately SVN places .SVN hidden directories everywhere which cause problems, especially when other developers make folder structure changes or copy/move website directories.  I've heard the argument that this is a matter of education etc. but the approach taken by SVN is simply not a practical solution for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am thinking that maybe an incremental backup solution may be better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other possibilities include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://svk.bestpractical.com/view/HomePage" rel="nofollow"&gt;SVK&lt;/a&gt;, which is command-line only which becomes a problem.  Besides, I am unsure on how appropriate this would be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mercurial&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps with some triggers to hide the distributed component which is not required in this case and would be unnecessarily complicated for other developers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I experimented briefly with Mercurial but couldn't find a nice way to have the repository seperate and kept constantly in-sync with the live folder working copy. Maybe as a source control solution (making repository and live folder the same place) combined with another backup solution this could be the way to go.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One downside of Mercurial is that it doesn't place empty folders under source control which is problematic for websites which often have empty folders as placeholder locations for file uploads etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Rsync&lt;/a&gt;, which I haven't really investigated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not so much about education as no familiarity with anything but VSS and a lack of time/effort to learn anything else.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The xcopy/7-zip approach sounds reasonable I guess but it would quickly take up a lot of room right?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as source control, I think I'd like the source control to just say that "this is the state of the folder now, I'll deal with that and if I can't match stuff up that's your fault, I'll just start new histories" rather than fail hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;@Steve M&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yeah that's a nicer way of doing it but would require a significant cultural change.  Having said that I very much like this approach. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nice, I didn't think about using Rsync to deploy. Does this only upload the differences? Overwriting the entire live directory everytime we make a change would be problematic due to site downtime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still curious to see if there are any more traditional options&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because each type of Task has a multitude of different associated fields, I decided it would be best to represent each type of Task with a seperate class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, I constructed an abstract base class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public abstract class Task
{
    public enum TaskType
    {
     // Types of Tasks
    } 

    public abstract TaskType Type
    {
     get;
    } 

    public abstract LoadFromXml(XmlElement task);
    public abstract XmlElement CreateXml(XmlDocument currentDoc);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each task inherited from this base class, and included the code necessary to create itself from the passed in XmlElement, as well as serialize itself back out to an XmlElement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A basic example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class MergeTask : Task
{

    public override TaskType Type
    {
     get { return TaskType.Merge; }
    } 

    // Lots of Properties / Methods for this Task

    public MergeTask (XmlElement elem)
    {
     this.LoadFromXml(elem);
    }

    public override LoadFromXml(XmlElement task)
    {
     // Populates this Task from the Xml.
    }

    public override XmlElement CreateXml(XmlDocument currentDoc)
    {
     // Serializes this class back to xml.
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parser would then use code similar to this to create a task collection:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;XmlNode taskNode = parent.SelectNode("tasks");

TaskFactory tf = new TaskFactory();

foreach (XmlNode task in taskNode.ChildNodes)
{
    // Since XmlComments etc will show up
    if (task is XmlElement)
    {
     tasks.Add(tf.CreateTask(task as XmlElement));
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this works wonderfully, and allows me to pass tasks around using the base class, while retaining the structure of having individual classes for each task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I am not happy with my code for TaskFactory.CreateTask. This method accepts an XmlElement, and then returns an instance of the appropriate Task class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public Task CreateTask(XmlElement elem)
{
    if (elem != null)
    {
     switch(elem.Name)
     {
      case "merge":
       return new MergeTask(elem);
      default:
       throw new ArgumentException("Invalid Task");
     }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I have to parse the XMLElement, I'm using a huge (10-15 cases in the real code) switch to pick which child class to instantiate. I'm hoping there is some sort of polymorphic trick I can do here to clean up this method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice?&lt;/p&gt;

You can make a factory that basically expands without you having to add any extra code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;make sure you have "using System.Reflection", place the following code in your instantiation method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public Task CreateTask(XmlElement elem)
{
    if (elem != null)
    { 
        try
        {
          Assembly a = typeof(Task).Assembly
          string type = string.Format("{0}.{1}Task",typeof(Task).Namespace,elem.Name);

          //this is only here, so that if that type doesn't exist, this method
          //throws an exception
          Type t = a.GetType(type, true, true);

          return a.CreateInstance(type, true) as Task;
        }
        catch(System.Exception)
        {
          throw new ArgumentException("Invalid Task");
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another observation, is that you can make this method, a static and hang it off of the Task class, so that you don't have to new up the TaskFactory, and also you get to save yourself a moving piece to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're talking strictly about variable declaration, then it doesn't matter whether or not you put it inside an if statement.  Any Javascript variable declared inside a function is in scope for the entire function, regardless of where it is declared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enum?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I admit that it feels hacky. Reflection feels dirty at first, but once you tame the beast you will enjoy what it allows you to do. (Remember recursion, it feels dirty, but its good)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick is to realize, you are analyzing meta data, in this case a string provided from xml, and turning it into run-time behavior. That is what reflection is the best at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really you need to know what oldFunction is going to be doing with pStuff. If pStuff is a pointer to some unmanaged data you can try wrapping the definition  of m_pStuff with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#pragma unmanaged

void* m_pStuff

#pragma managed
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will make the pointer unmanaged which can then be passed into unmanaged functions. Of course you will not be able to assign any managed objects to this pointer directly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally unmanaged and managed pointers are not the same and can't be converted without some sort of glue code that copies the underlying data. Basically managed pointers point to the managed heap and since this is garbage collected the actual memory address they point to can change over time. Unmanaged pointers do not change the memory address without you explicitly doing so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scratch that, you can't define unmanaged / managed inside a class definition. But this test code seems to work just fine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// TestSol.cpp : main project file.

#include "stdafx.h"

using namespace System;

#pragma unmanaged

void oldFunction(void** pStuff)
{
    return;
}

#pragma managed

ref class Test
{
public:
    void* m_test;

};

int main(array&amp;lt;System::String ^&amp;gt; ^args)
{
    Console::WriteLine(L"Hello World");

    Test^ test = gcnew Test();
    void* pStuff = test-&amp;gt;m_test;
    oldFunction(&amp;amp;pStuff);
    test-&amp;gt;m_test = pStuff;

    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I copy the pointer out of the managed object first and then pass that in by to the oldFunction. Then I copy the result (probably updated by oldFunction) back into the managed object. Since the managed object is on the managed heap, the compiler won't let you pass a reference to the pointer contained in that object as it may move when the garbage collector runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No&lt;/strong&gt;, you cannot limit the results within the LinqDataSource control. Because Linq uses deferred execution, the expectation is that the presentation control will do the recordset limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt;, you can do this with a ListView control. The trick is to use the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.webcontrols.datapager.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;DataPager&lt;/a&gt; control within the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.webcontrols.listview.layouttemplate.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;LayoutTemplate&lt;/a&gt;, like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;LayoutTemplate&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;div id="itemPlaceholder" runat="server" /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;asp:DataPager ID="DataPager1" runat="server" PageSize="3"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/asp:DataPager&amp;gt;            
&amp;lt;/LayoutTemplate&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, you would include controls inside the DataPager like first, last, next, and previous. But if you just make it empty, then you will only see the three results that you desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your VPN users will be accessing via the private IP, so you can setup a "site-wide" rule on that site that will only affect VPN users. This should work for almost any IIS6 setting, including bandwidth throttling.&lt;/p&gt;

I'd like to come up with a solution that would prevent a person with basic computer skills from accidentally or intentionally accessing the page directly&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the callback is buried in the client code, it would take someone with equal determination to get either the querystring or the POST request. IE, if they have firebug, your equally screwed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in that case, do whatever is easiest to you (Hint: I'd just use the querystring).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To handle repeating requests/direct access, I'd generate a key that is sent with each request. Perhaps a hash of the current time (Fuzzy, I'd go down to minutes, but not seconds due to network latency) + the client IP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in the HTTPHandler, perform the same hash, and only run if they match.&lt;/p&gt;

I prefer the one at &lt;a href="http://jsbeautifier.org/"&gt;http://jsbeautifier.org/&lt;/a&gt;, because it's what I found first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, download and install The Mozilla group's Java based Javascript engine, &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt;.  "Install" is a little bit misleading;  Download the zip file, extract everything, place js.jar in your Java classpath (or Library/Java/Extensions on OS X).  You can then run scripts with an invocation similar to this &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;java org.mozilla.javascript.tools.shell.Main name-of-script.js
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the Pretty Print/Beautifier from step 1 to write a small shell script that will read in your javascript file and run it through the Pretty Print/Beautifier from step one.  For example&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;//new code
print(js_beautify(readFile(arguments[0])));

//original code    
function js_beautify(js_source_text, indent_size, etc...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rhino gives javascript a few extra useful functions that don't necesarily make sense in a browser context, but do in a console context. The function print does what you'd expect, and prints out a string.  The function readFile accepts a file path string as an argument and returns the contents of that file.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'd invoke the above something like &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;java org.mozilla.javascript.tools.shell.Main beautify.js file-to-pp.js
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can mix and match Java and Javascript in your Rhino run scripts, so if you know a little Java it shouldn't be too hard to get this running with text-streams as well.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Simplify the design and
implementation of large tables that
need to be partitioned for
performance or manageability
purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load data into a new partition of an
existing partitioned table with
minimal disruption in data access in
the remaining partitions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load data into a new partition of an
existing partitioned table with
performance equal to loading the same
data into a new, empty table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archive and/or remove a portion of a
partitioned table while minimally
impacting access to the remainder of
the table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow partitions to be maintained by switching partitions in and out of the partitioned table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow better scaling and parallelism for extremely large operations over multiple related tables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve performance over all partitions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve query optimization time because each partition does not need to be optimized separately. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get the list of mounted partitions from &lt;code&gt;/proc/mounts&lt;/code&gt;, only match &lt;code&gt;/mnt/remote1&lt;/code&gt; (and if it is mounted, send grep's output to &lt;code&gt;/dev/null&lt;/code&gt;), then run your &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know for sure there are the obvious cons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wide columns of text are hard to read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing html/css using percents can be a pain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It makes you vulnerable to having your design stretched past it's limits if an image is too wide, or a block of text is added that is too long. (see it's a pain to code the html/css)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only Pro I can think of is that users who use the font-resizing that is built into their browser won't have to deal with columns that are only a few words long, with a body of whitespace on either side. However, I think that may be a browser problem more than anything else (Firefox 3 allows you to zoom &lt;strong&gt;everything&lt;/strong&gt; instead of just the text, which comes in handy all the time)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;edit&lt;/strong&gt;: I noticed stack overflow is fixed width, but coding horror resizes. It seems Jeff doesn't have a strong preference either way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example looking at the memory map of a &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; command on my system I can see its memory mappings. In this case I use &lt;code&gt;cat /proc/self/maps&lt;/code&gt; to investigate the cat process itself. Mapped into its virtual memory is the binary itself, some heap, locale information, libc (with various permission flags), ld.so (the dynamic linker), stack, vdso and vsyscall sections and some anonymous mappings (mapped pages with no backing file).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you add up all these figures, you'll get the process' virtual memory (VM) size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VM size is not a reliable way to determine how much memory a process is using. For instance there will only be one copy of each of the read-only &lt;code&gt;/lib/libc-2.7.so&lt;/code&gt; maps in physical memory, regardless of how many processes use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can make the classes "self-registering" by calling a static register method on the factory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put calls to register ( with constructors) in the static blocks on the Task subclasses.
Then all you need to do is "mention" the classes to get the static blocks run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A static array of Task subclasses would then suffice to "mention" them.
Or use reflection to mention the classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MySQL is much more commonly provided by web hosts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL is a much more mature product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's &lt;a href="http://www.databasejournal.com/features/mysql/article.php/3288951"&gt;this discussion addressing your "better" question&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, according to &lt;a href="http://www.teknico.net/devel/myvspg/index.en.html"&gt;this web page&lt;/a&gt;, MySQL is fast when concurrent access levels are low, and when there are many more reads than writes. On the other hand, it exhibits low scalability with increasing loads and write/read ratios. PostgreSQL is relatively slow at low concurrency levels, but scales well with increasing load levels, while providing enough isolation between concurrent accesses to avoid slowdowns at high write/read ratios.  It goes on to link to a number of performance comparisons, because these things are very... sensitive to conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if your decision factor is, "&lt;strong&gt;which is faster?&lt;/strong&gt;"  Then the answer is "it depends.  &lt;strong&gt;If it really matters, test your application against both.&lt;/strong&gt;"  And if you really, really care, you get in two DBAs (one who specializes in each database) and get them to tune the crap out of the databases, and then choose.  It's astonishing how expensive &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; DBAs are; and &lt;em&gt;they are worth every cent&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it matters.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which it probably doesn't, so just pick whichever database you like the sound of and go with it; better performance can be bought with more RAM and CPU, and more appropriate database design, and clever stored procedure tricks and so on - and all of that is cheaper and easier for random-website-X than agonizing over which to pick, MySQL or PostgreSQL, and specialist tuning from expensive DBAs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;MySQL is the only database I've ever programmed against in my career that has had data integrity problems, where you do queries and you get nonsense answers back, that are incorrect.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;that's one of the reasons I don't understand why it cannot be a part of the contract in the interface&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's an indirect mechanism.  The generic allows you to "cheat" and send type information along with the interface.  The critical thing to remember here is that the constraint isn't on the interface that you are working with directly.  It's not a constraint on the interface itself, but on some other type that will "ride along" on the interface.  This is the best explanation I can offer, I'm afraid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By way of illustration of this fact, I'll point out a hole that I have noticed in aku's code.  It's possible to write a class that would compile fine but fail at runtime when you try to instantiate it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class Something : ITest&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;
{
  private Something() { }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something derives from ITest&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;, but implements no parameterless constructor.  It will compile fine, because String does implement a parameterless constructor.  Again, the constraint is on T, and therefore String, rather than ITest or Something.  Since the constraint on T is satisfied, this will compile.  But it will fail at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prevent &lt;strong&gt;some&lt;/strong&gt; instances of this problem, you need to add another constraint to T, as below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public interface ITest&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;
  where T : ITest&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;, new()
{
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the new constraint: T : ITest&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;. This constraint specifies that what you pass into the argument parameter of ITest&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; also &lt;strong&gt;derive&lt;/strong&gt; from ITest&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so this will not prevent &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; cases of the hole.  The code below will compile fine, because A has a parameterless constructor.  But since B's parameterless constructor is private, instantiating B with your process will fail at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class A : ITest&amp;lt;A&amp;gt;
{
}

public class B : ITest&amp;lt;A&amp;gt;
{
  private B() { }
}

&lt;p&gt;The genetic algorithm is easiest to implement when the target language is functional and dynamically typed. That is generally why most genetic algorithm research is written in LISP. As a result, if you are going to implement it in C#, you are probably better off defining your own mini "tree language", having the algorithm generate trees, and just interpreting the trees when it comes time to run each iteration of the algorithm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a project like this when I was in college (an implementation of the genetic algorithm in C#), and that was the approach I took.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing it that way will give you the advantage of only having 1 representation to work with (the AST representation) that is optimally suited for both execution and the genetic algorithm "reproduction" steps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if you try to generate assemblies you are probably going to end up adding a large amount of unneeded complexity to the app. Currently, the CLR does not allow an assembly to be unloaded from an App domain unless the entire app domain is destroyed. This would mean that you would need to spin up a separate app domain for each generated program in each iteration of the algorithm to avoid introducing a giant memory leak into your app. In general, the whole thing would just add a bunch of extra irritation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interpreted AST's, on the other hand, are garbage collectible just like any other object, and so you wouldn't need to monkey around with multiple app domains. If, for performance reasons you want to code-gen the final result you can add support for that later. However, I you would recommend that you do that using the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.emit.dynamicmethod.aspx"&gt;DynamicMethod&lt;/a&gt; class. It will allow you to convert an AST into a compiled delegate dynamically at runtime. That will enable you to deploy a single DLL while keeping the code generation stuff as simple as possible. Also, DynamicMethod instances are garbage collectible so you could end up employing them as part of the genetic algorithm to speed things up there as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that disclaimer out of the way, let's define what the request scope is and where it would be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The request scope is the absolute global scope in a single ColdFusion page request.  It is not a shared scope, like application, server, client, and session scopes, so locking is not necessary to make it threadsafe (unless you spawn worker threads from a single request using CF8's CFTHREAD tag).  As a global scope, it is a very convenient way to persist variables through any level in the request's stack without having to pass them from parent to caller.  This was a very common way to persist variables through nested or recursive Custom Tags in older CF apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that while many applications use this scope to store application-level variables (configuration settings, for example), the big (and sometimes subtle) difference between the request scope and the application scope is that the value of the same request-scoped variable can differ between individual page requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would guess that your predecessor used this scope as a means to conveniently set variables that needed to survive the jump between encapsulated or nested units of code without having to pass them around explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;When you have to use manage memory
manually, make sure you call delete
in the same
scope/function/class/module, which
ever applies first, e.g.:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let the caller of a function allocate the memory that is filled by it,
do not return new'ed pointers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always call delete in the same exe/dll as you called new in, because otherwise you may have problems with heap corruptions (different incompatible runtime libraries).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Only one object will ever own a pointer. By default this is the creator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ownership can be passed on. To indicate passing of ownership, the object is passed as a pointer in the method signature (e.g. void Foo(Bar *zonk);).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The owner will decide when to delete the object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To pass an object to a method just for use, the object is passed as a reference in the method signature (e.g. void Foo(Bat &amp;amp;zonk);).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-owner classes may store references (never pointers) to objects they are given only when they can be certain that the owner will not destroy it during use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, if a class simply uses something, it uses a reference. If a class owns something, it uses a pointer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This worked beautifully and was a pleasure to use. Memory issues were very rare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;undefined&lt;/strong&gt; means that the variable value has not been defined; it is not known what the value is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;null&lt;/strong&gt; means that the variable value is defined and set to null (has no value).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marijn Haverbeke states, in his free, online book "&lt;a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/"&gt;Eloquent JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;" (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is also a similar value, null, whose meaning is 'this value is defined, but it does not have a value'. The difference in meaning between undefined and null is mostly academic, and usually not very interesting. &lt;strong&gt;In practical programs, it is often necessary to check whether something 'has a value'. In these cases, the expression something == undefined may be used, because, even though they are not exactly the same value, null == undefined will produce true.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I guess the best way to check if something was undefined would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (something == undefined)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;

Interpolating colours is easy by calculating the same interpolation for each of its components (R, G, B). There are many ways to interpolate. The easiest is to use linear interpolation: just take percentage &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; of the first colour and percentage 1 - &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; of the second:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;R = firstCol.R * p + secondCol.R * (1 - p)

&lt;p&gt;There's &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25007/conditional-formatting-percentage-to-color-conversion"&gt;another question&lt;/a&gt; related to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other methods of interpolation that sometimes work better. For example, using a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function" rel="nofollow"&gt;bell-shaped (sigmoidal)&lt;/a&gt; interpolation function makes the transition smoother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following should help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User A starts a transaction and is updating 1000 rows with some value At Time T1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User B reads the same 1000 rows at time T2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User A updates row 543 with value Y (original value X)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User B reaches row 543 and finds that a transaction is in operation since Time T1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The database returns the unmodified record from the Logs. The returned value is the value that was committed at the time less than or equal to T2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the record could not be retreived from the redo logs it means the database is not setup appropriately. There needs to be more space allocated to the logs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This way the read consitency is achieved. The returned results are always the same with respect to the start time of transaction. So within a transaction the read consistency is achieved.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You're wrong on VM Size. It's the total of all private (not shared) bytes allocated by this process, whether currently in physical memory or not. It's a better value for tracking whether you have a memory leak than 'Mem Usage'. The same value is available in Performance Monitor as 'Process: Private Bytes'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When an exception occurs, you have to
  either catch and handle the exception,
  or tell compiler that you can't handle
  it by declaring that your method
  throws that exception, then the code
  that uses your method will have to
  handle that exception (even it also
  may choose to declare that it throws
  the exception if it can't handle it). &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Compiler will check that we have done
  one of the two things (catch, or
  declare).  So these are called Checked
  exceptions.   But Errors, and Runtime
  Exceptions are not checked for by
  compiler (even though you can choose
  to catch, or declare, it is not
  required).  So, these two are called
  Unchecked exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Errors are used to represent those
  conditions which occur outside the
  application, such as crash of the
  system.  Runtime exceptions are
  usually occur by fault in the
  application logic.  You can't do
  anything in these situations.  When
  runtime exception occur, you have to
  re-write your program code.  So, these
  are not  checked by compiler.  These
  runtime exceptions will uncover in
  development, and testing period.  Then
  we have to refactor our code to remove
  these errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not very experienced with internationalisation using PHP, it must be said, and a deal of searching didn't really provide the answers I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm in need of working out a reliable way to convert only 'relevant' text to Unicode to send in an SMS message, using PHP (just temporarily, whilst a service is rewritten using C#) - obviously, messages sent at the moment are sent as plain text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could conceivably convert everything to the Unicode charset (as opposed to using the standard GSM charset), but that would mean that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; messages would be limited to 70 characters (instead of 160).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I guess my real question is: &lt;em&gt;what is the most reliable way to detect the requirement for a message to be Unicode-encoded, so I only have to do it when it's&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;absolutely necessary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(e.g. for non-Latin-language characters)?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Added Info:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I've spent the morning working on this, and I'm still no further on than when I started (certainly due to my complete lack of competency when it comes to charset conversion).  So here's the revised scenario:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have text SMS messages coming from an external source, this external source provides the responses to me in plain text + unicode slash-escaped characters.  E.g. the 'displayed' text:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let's test     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let's test \u00f6\u00e4\u00fc \u00e9\u00e0\u00e8 \u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05ea\u05de\u05d9\u05db\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I can send on to my SMS provider in plaintext, GSM 03.38 or Unicode.  Obviously, sending the above as plaintext results in a lot of missing characters (they're replaced by spaces by my provider) - I need to adapt relating to what content there is.  What I want to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; with this is the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all text is within the &lt;a href="http://www.dreamfabric.com/sms/default_alphabet.html"&gt;GSM 03.38 codepage&lt;/a&gt;, send it as-is.  (All but the Hebrew characters above fit into this category, but need to be converted.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, convert it to Unicode, and send it over multiple messages (as the Unicode limit is 70 chars not 160 for an SMS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said above, I'm stumped on doing this in PHP (C# wasn't much of an issue due to some simple conversion functions built-in), but it's quite probable I'm just missing the obvious, here.  I couldn't find any pre-made conversion classes for 7-bit encoding in PHP, either - and my attempts to convert the string myself and send it on seemed futile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any help would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;find_if(serverNames.begin(), serverNames.end(), ContactServer());

  &lt;p&gt;IDisposable is for managed resources.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Finalisers are for unmanaged resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry but that's just wrong. Normally, the finalizer does nothing at all. However, if the &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/bclteam/archive/2007/10/30/dispose-pattern-and-object-lifetime-brian-grunkemeyer.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;dispose pattern&lt;/a&gt; has been correctly implemented, the finalizer tries to invoke &lt;code&gt;Dispose&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Dispose&lt;/code&gt; has two jobs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free unmanaged resources, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;free nested managed resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here your statement comes into play because it's true that while finalizing, an object should never try to free nested managed resources as these may have already been freed. It must still free unmanaged resources though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, finalizers have no job other than to call &lt;code&gt;Dispose&lt;/code&gt; and tell it not to touch managed objects. &lt;code&gt;Dispose&lt;/code&gt;, when called manually (or via &lt;code&gt;Using&lt;/code&gt;), shall free all unmanaged resources and pass the &lt;code&gt;Dispose&lt;/code&gt; message on to nested objects (and base class methods) but this will &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; free any (managed) memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals(java.lang.Object)"&gt;javadoc&lt;/a&gt;) must define an equality relation (it must be &lt;em&gt;reflexive&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;symmetric&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;transitive&lt;/em&gt;). In addition, it must be &lt;em&gt;consistent&lt;/em&gt; (if the objects are not modified, then it must keep returning the same value). Furthermore, &lt;code&gt;o.equals(null)&lt;/code&gt; must always return false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;hashCode()&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#hashCode()"&gt;javadoc&lt;/a&gt;) must also be &lt;em&gt;consistent&lt;/em&gt; (if the object is not modified in terms of &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt;, it must keep returning the same value).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relation between the two methods is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whenever &lt;code&gt;a.equals(b)&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;a.hashCode()&lt;/code&gt; must be same as &lt;code&gt;b.hashCode()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;In practice:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you override one, then you should override the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the same set of fields that you use to compute &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt; to compute &lt;code&gt;hashCode()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the excellent helper classes &lt;a href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/apidocs/org/apache/commons/lang3/builder/EqualsBuilder.html"&gt;EqualsBuilder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/apidocs/org/apache/commons/lang3/builder/HashCodeBuilder.html"&gt;HashCodeBuilder&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="http://commons.apache.org/lang/"&gt;Apache Commons Lang&lt;/a&gt; library. An example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    // ...

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return new HashCodeBuilder(17, 31). // two randomly chosen prime numbers
            // if deriving: appendSuper(super.hashCode()).
            append(name).
            append(age).
            toHashCode();
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
       if (!(obj instanceof Person))
            return false;
        if (obj == this)
            return true;

        Person rhs = (Person) obj;
        return new EqualsBuilder().
            // if deriving: appendSuper(super.equals(obj)).
            append(name, rhs.name).
            append(age, rhs.age).
            isEquals();
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Also remember:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using a hash-based &lt;a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html"&gt;Collection&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/Map.html"&gt;Map&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/HashSet.html"&gt;HashSet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/LinkedHashSet.html"&gt;LinkedHashSet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html"&gt;HashMap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html"&gt;Hashtable&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/WeakHashMap.html"&gt;WeakHashMap&lt;/a&gt;, make sure that the hashCode() of the key objects that you put into the collection never changes while the object is in the collection.

&lt;li&gt;how to set it up in the calling application&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know the uber tutorial that we should link to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; Glenn Slaven pointed me in the right direction. Add this to your App.config/Web.config inside &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;configuration/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;system.diagnostics&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;trace autoflush="true"&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;listeners&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;add type="System.Diagnostics.TextWriterTraceListener" name="TextWriter"
             initializeData="trace.log" /&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/listeners&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/trace&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/system.diagnostics&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will add a &lt;code&gt;TextWriterTraceListener&lt;/code&gt; that will catch everything you send to with &lt;code&gt;Trace.WriteLine&lt;/code&gt; etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; @DanEsparza pointed out that you should use &lt;code&gt;Trace.TraceInformation&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Trace.TraceWarning&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Trace.TraceError&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;Trace.WriteLine&lt;/code&gt;, as they allow you to format messages the same way as &lt;code&gt;string.Format&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; If you don't add any listeners, then you can still see the trace output with the SysInternals program DebugView (&lt;code&gt;Dbgview.exe&lt;/code&gt;): &lt;a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896647.aspx"&gt;http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896647.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It's actually best practice to use function objects instead of function pointers in such situations because compilers are better at inlining them. In your case, the instantiation and call of the function object may have no overhead at all since &lt;code&gt;find_if&lt;/code&gt; is a function template and the compiler will generate an own version for your functor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, using a function pointer would incur an indirection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I learned x86 asm by using Turbo Pascal (which I think is now free from Borland?), which had the ability to embed assembly instructions inside a function. Made it easier to setup the app, and I could focus on the stuff I wanted to do. I later used MacVAX at Auckland Uni, which was ok, but the VAX is very much dead - you may as well learn x86 :)&lt;/p&gt;

It seems that people still make that connection when they hear the word 'Java'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, Java does have many real drawbacks and annoyances (as does any language). Most of them have been outlined above. I particularly second Patrick's comment on checked exceptions. Here is my favorite example of that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;try {
    ...
    writer = new FileWriter(pathToFile);
    writer.write("Some stuff");
    writer.flush();
} catch(IOException e) {
    // OK, so an IO error could occur, log it and deal with if possible
} finally {
    // We want to close the stream regardless of if an exception occurred.
    try {
         writer.close(); // But close() throws a checked exception!
    } catch (IOException e) {
         // It does not make any sense to throw this exception, so we have to catch it
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way to make this code less bloated is to have the method throw an IOException, which is essentially only passing the problem on to the caller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the record though, I do most of my work in Java and generally like it.&lt;/p&gt;

You shouldn't implement it unless you are dealing with unmanaged resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, when you do implement it, you use &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fs2xkftw.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;Microsoft's dispose pattern&lt;/a&gt; (as &lt;a href="#12405" rel="nofollow"&gt;already described&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;public Dispose()&lt;/code&gt; calls &lt;code&gt;protected Dispose(true)&lt;/code&gt; - deals with both managed and unmanaged resources. Calling &lt;code&gt;Dispose()&lt;/code&gt; should suppress finalisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~Finalize&lt;/code&gt; calls &lt;code&gt;protected Dispose(false)&lt;/code&gt; - deals with unmanaged resources only. This prevents unmanaged memory leaks if you fail to call the &lt;code&gt;public Dispose()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~Finalize&lt;/code&gt; is slow, and shouldn't be used unless you do have unmanaged resources to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managed resources can't memory leak, they can only waste resources for the current application and slow its garbage collection.  Unmanaged resources can leak, and &lt;code&gt;~Finalize&lt;/code&gt; is best practice to ensure that they don't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In either case &lt;code&gt;using&lt;/code&gt; is best practice.&lt;/p&gt;

Most commonly, these objects are other lists (thus forming trees) and symbols, but they can be other objects such as strings, hashtables, user-defined objects, etc. These structures are called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression"&gt;s-exps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when you load a source file, your Lisp compiler will parse the text and produce s-exps. Macros operate on these. This works great and it's a marvellous way to extend the language within the spirit of s-exps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the aforementioned parsing process can be extended through "reader macros" that let you customize the way your compiler turns text into s-exps. I suggest, however, that you embrace Lisp's syntax instead of bending it into something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You sound a bit confused when you mention Lisp's "functional nature" and Ruby's "object-oriented syntax". I'm not sure what "object-oriented syntax" is supposed to be, but Lisp is a multi-paradigm language and it supports object-oriented programming &lt;em&gt;extremelly&lt;/em&gt; well.&lt;/p&gt;

We make use of quite a few custom controls that handle all their own drawing (all written using MFC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I've been doing more research into Qt and the benefits it provides (cross-platform and supports what you might call a more "professional" looking framework for UI development).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is - &lt;strong&gt;what would be the best approach to perhaps moving to the Qt framework&lt;/strong&gt;?  Does Qt play nice with MFC?  Would it be better to start porting some of our custom controls to Qt and gradually integrate more and more into our existing MFC apps? (is this possible?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice or previous experience is appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

Not terribly much, but enough that our server felt the load. The solution we chose was simple: Memcache at the database level. This solution works well if the database load is your main problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started out using Memcache to cache entire objects and the database results that were most frequently used. It did work, but it also introduced bugs (we might have avoided some of those if we had been more careful).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we changed our approach. We built a database wrapper (with the exact same methods as our old database, so it was easy to switch), and then we subclassed it to provide memcached database access methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now all you have to do is decide whether a query can use cached (and possibly out of date) results or not. Most of the queries run by the users are now fetched directly from Memcache. The exceptions are updates and inserts, which for the main website only happens because of logging. This rather simple measure reduced our server load by about 80%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd suggest reading the relevant sections of "Effective C++" by Scott Meyers. Easy to read and he covers some interesting gotchas to trap the unwary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm also intrigued by the lack of templates. So no STL or Boost. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I think the way to do(get around) this problem is to develop a "./configure &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make" script that your client uses to install, specify and compile the binaries. That would offcourse require that the client has all the source-code installed on his server or you can make it available on an NFS share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention a complete build toolchain. These days, GCC doesn't come default with most major distributions. Wouldn't it be sane to force the client to install it to &lt;code&gt;/opt/my_apache2/&lt;/code&gt; or something like that?&lt;/p&gt;

You will get a much better result if you port your custom controls to Qt - if you use the QStyle classes to do the actual drawing then you'll end up with theme-able code right out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, my advice would be to bite the bullet and go the whole way at once. Sure, it might take  longer, but the alternative is to spend an age trying to debug code that doesn't &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; play ball, and end up writing more code to deal with minor incompatibilities between the two systems (been there, done that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to summarise, my advice is to start a branch and rip out all your old MFC code and replace it with Qt. You'll get platform independence (almost) for free, and while it will take a while, you'll end up with a much nicer product at the end of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final word of warning: make sure you take the time to understand the "Qt way of doing things" - in some cases it can be quite different to the MFC approach - the last thing you want to do is to end up with MFC-style Qt code.&lt;/p&gt;

You start paying more attention to the syntactical constructs you create via s-exprs and macros, and less to the lexical form of the text of lists and parenthesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is specially true if you take advantage of a good editor that helps with the indentation and syntax coloring (try setting the parenthesis to a color very similar to the background).&lt;/p&gt;

We moved over about 15% of our applications content/traffic to EC2 in mid-June.  The result is mixed, and we are moving the content heavy usage instance back to our hosted data center, and now are investigating other content delivery options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do note that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My application is bandwidth hungry (starting at 100mbps per instance) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My company and I are based in Switzerland and that surely has had an impact on our evaluation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I define bandwidth as a rate of flow (mbps, etc.) and traffic as volume (mb, gb, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pros:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traffic costs for low to medium volumes, assuming less than maybe a terabyte per month.  Exceed that fuzzy line and either do it yourself or find a proper CDN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Active user community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effectively unlimited bandwidth with S3/CloudFront-delivered content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexibility (kick off an instance and have it running in minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CPU power available in an instance, even the small instance type, was always enough for my application.  There are other high-CPU instance types for those who need it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cons:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had an instance become unreachable (a not unheard of occurrence) and had execute our disaster recovery procedure.  12h.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network latency, for both S3 and EC2, can be unacceptably high (100s of ms)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EC2 instance bandwidth is limited.  Despite hours of search, I never found an official statement with hard numbers one what users can expect. Initially we saw a max of ~250mpbs in tests but that seems to have improved dramatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Per HTTP connection bandwidth can be unacceptably low.  1-2mbps from even our Swiss data center with a 800mpbs connection and quality peering.  EDIT: We have recently seen rates between our data center and EC2 in the 3-4mpbs range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S3 is not a 'normal' file system&lt;strike&gt;, and special software is required.  We chose JungleDisk, which I now find inappropriate for a 24/7, moderately sized data set server environment.  Strange things would happen (file listed twice with an 'ls' command) and unexpected crashes.  &lt;/strike&gt;  Use &lt;a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/" rel="nofollow"&gt;EBS&lt;/a&gt; for persistent data, although that is &lt;a href="http://teddziuba.com/2011/04/amazon-the-purpose-of-pain.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;not without caveats&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;S3 is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a CDN.  My company, like many others, have tried to use Amazon S3 as a CDN.  There are other low cost alternatives out there.  (Akamai, voxel.net, easycache.com)  &lt;/strike&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a fan of the cloud concept, and we will continue to run an instance out of EC2, but we found it inappropriate for our main production needs in its current form.  AWS has some issues to sort out.&lt;/p&gt;

That is, one single top down list of downloads which are custom controls containing progress bars, buttons and what not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The requirements are that there should be one single list, with one element on each row. Each element must be a custom control. The whole list should be dynamically re-sizable, so that when you make it longer / shorter the list adds a scroll bar when needed and when you make it thinner / wider the custom controls should resize to the width of the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've tried using a &lt;code&gt;FlowLayoutPanel&lt;/code&gt; but haven't gotten resizing to work the way we want to. Preferably we should only have to set anchoring of the custom controls to Left &amp;amp; Right. We've also thought about using a &lt;code&gt;TableLayoutPanel&lt;/code&gt; but found adding rows dynamically to be a too big overhead so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This must be quite a common use case, and it seems a bit weird to me that the &lt;code&gt;FlowLayoutPanel&lt;/code&gt; has no intuitive way of doing this. &lt;em&gt;Has anyone done something similar or have tips or tricks to get us under way?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should add every file you want to ignore to the .gitignore file. I additionally always check the .gitignore file to my repository, so if someone checks out the code on his machine, and the file gets generated again, he won't 'see' it as 'dirty'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course if you already committed the file and someone else got your changes on another machine, you would have to alter every local repository to modify the history. At least that's a possible solution with git. I don't think svn would let you do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the file is already on the master repository (git) or in the server (svn), I don't think there is a better solution than just deleting the file in another commit. &lt;/p&gt;

Individual developers would make a copy of this file in &lt;code&gt;config.xml&lt;/code&gt; and tweak it for their system.

If they happen not to have made any local changes, then their config file will vanish but they can just re-get the previous one out of source control and use that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in setting the document root, you might look at getting a web server installed on your machine, or, if you already have one (like Apache or IIS), storing your project-in-development in the web root of that server (htdocs in Apache, not entirely sure in IIS). If you'd rather leave your files where they are, you can set up virtual hosts and even map them to addresses that you can type into your browser (for example, I have a local.mrwarshaw.com address that resolves to the web root of my personal site's development folder).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're on Windows and don't want to mess around with setting up a server on your own, you could get a package like XAMPP or WAMPP, though bear in mind that those carry the extra weight of PHP and MySQL with them. Still, if you've got the space, they're a pretty easy drop-in development environment for your machine.&lt;/p&gt;

Currently, it's a C++ app using raw Win32, through necessity: none of the various toolkits are worth a damn.  WPF, in particular, was not possible, due to its airspace restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, so, now that D3DImage exists it might be viable to mix and match D3D/VMR9/DirectShow and WPF. Given past frustrations with Win32's inextensibility, this seems like a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But y'know, I'm falling at the first hurdle here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Win32 I have created (very easily) a borderless window that's resizable, resizes proportionately, snaps to the screen edges, and takes up the whole screen (including taskbar area) when maximized. It's a video app, so these are all pretty desirable properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, so, how to do the same with WPF?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Win32, I use:
WM_GETMINMAXINFO to control the maximize behaviour
WM_NCHITTEST to control the resize borders
WM_MOVING to control the snap-to-screen-edges
WM_SIZING to control the resize aspect ratio&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, looking at WPF it seems that the various events arrive too late, unless I'm misunderstanding the documentation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I don't know when I'm mid-move, as LocationChanged says it fires only once the window has moved (which is too late).
Similarly, it appears that StateChanged only fires once the window has been restored/maximized (when I need the information prior to the maximize, to tell the system the correct maximize size).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I seem to be completely overlooking where the system tells me about resizes. Likewise the hit testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, uh, am I missing something here, or do I have no choice but to drop back to hooking the wndproc of this thing anyway?  Can I do what I want without hooking the WndProc?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I have to use the WndProc I might as well stick with my existing codebase; I want to have simpler, cleaner UI code, and moving away from the WndProc is fundamental to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I do have to hook the WndProc, I have to wonder--&lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;?  Win32 has got the sizing/sized, moving/moved, poschanging/poschanged window messages, and they're all useful.  Why wouldn't WPF replicate the same set of events?  It seems like an unnecessary gap in functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, it means that WPF is tied to a specific USER32-dependent implementation.  This means that MS can't (in Windows 7 or 8, say) invert the display layer to make WPF "native" and emulate HWNDs and WndProcs for legacy apps--even though this is precisely what MS should be doing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Is there a way to open file in a non-exclusive way,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, using Win32, passing the various FILE_SHARE_Xxxx flags to CreateFile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;is it cross platform?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, it requires platform-specific code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to annoying backwards compatibility concerns (DOS applications, being single-tasking, assume that nothing can delete a file out from under them, i.e. that they can fclose() and then fopen() without anything going amiss; Win16 preserved this assumption to make porting DOS applications easier, Win32 preserved this assumption to make porting Win16 applications easier, and it's awful), Windows defaults to opening files exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlying OS infrastructure supports deleting/renaming open files  (although I believe it does have the restriction that memory-mapped files cannot be deleted, which I think isn't a restriction found on *nix), but the default opening semantics do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C++ has no notion of any of this; the C++ operating environment is much the same as the DOS operating environment--no other applications running concurrently, so no need to control file sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, in short, I have a class that needs to be serialized to XML. In order for the &lt;em&gt;XmlSerializer&lt;/em&gt; to do its magic, the class must have a default, empty constructor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class MyClass
{
  public MyClass()
  {
    // required for xml serialization
  }
}

&lt;p&gt;So, I need to have it, but I don't want people to &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; it, so &lt;strong&gt;is there any attribute that can be use to mark the method as "DO NOT USE"?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking of using the &lt;em&gt;Obsolete&lt;/em&gt; attribute (since this can stop the build), but that just seems kinda "wrong", is there any other way of doing this, or do I need to go ahead and bite the bullet? :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, I have accepted Keith's answer, since I guess in my heart of hearts, I totally agree. This is why I asked the question in the first place, I don't like the notion of having the &lt;em&gt;Obsolete&lt;/em&gt; attribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; still a problem, while we are being notified in intellisense, ideally, we would like to break the build, so is there any way to do this? Perhaps create a custom attribute?&lt;/p&gt;

Each object in the enumeration has a method getRegexPattern that returns the regex pattern which will then be used to compare with a URL.

So, each enumeration has it's own regex depending on where it should look inside the URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have the capabilities for non-capturing matches, you can modify hometoast's expression so that subexpressions that you aren't interested in capturing are set up like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(?:SOMESTUFF)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'd still have to copy and paste (and slightly modify) the Regex into multiple places, but this makes sense--you're not just checking to see if the subexpression exists, but rather if it exists &lt;em&gt;as part of a URL&lt;/em&gt;. Using the non-capturing modifier for subexpressions can give you what you need and nothing more, which, if I'm reading you correctly, is what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as a small, small note, hometoast's expression doesn't need to put brackets around the 's' for 'https', since he only has one character in there. Quantifiers quantify the one character (or character class or subexpression) directly preceding them. So:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;https?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;would match 'http' or 'https' just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

We've been using Eclipse to build plugins due to the built-in manifest editor, dependency management, and export wizard. Using Eclipse to manager builds isn't very conducive to continuous integration via Hudson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have OSGi bundles which depend on other OSGi bundles. I'd really hate to hardcode build order in a custom ANT build. We've done this is the past and it's pretty horrible. Is there any build tool that can EASILY manage OSGi dependencies, if not automatically resolve them? Are there any DECENT examples of how to this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CLARIFICATION:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The generated build scripts are only usable via Eclipse. They require manually running pieces of Eclipse. We've also got some standard targets which the Eclipse build won't have, and I don't want to modify the generated file since I may regenerate (I know I can do includes, but I want to avoid the Eclipse gen file all together)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my project layout:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/
-PluginA
-PluginB
-PluginC
.
.
.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In using the Eclipse PDE, each plugin has a Manifest, but no build.xml as the PDE does that for me. Hard to automate a gui driven process w/ Hudson. I'd like to setup my own build.xml to build each, BUT there are dependencies and build order issues. These issues are driven by the Manifest files (which describe OSGi imports). For example, PluginC depends on PluginB which depends on PluginA. They must be built in the correct order. I realize that I can manually control the build order, I'm looking for a tool to help automate the build order dependency management.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And I seem to be completely overlooking where the system tells me about resizes. Likewise the hit testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the resizing you're indeed missing the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.frameworkelement.sizechanged.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;SizeChanged&lt;/a&gt; event.
AFAIK there is sadly no OnSizeChanging, OnLocationChanging and OnStateChanging event on a &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.window_events.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;Window&lt;/a&gt; in .NET
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I saw that one, but as far as I can tell it only fires after the size has changed, whereas I need the event to fire during the resize. Unless I'm misreading the docs and it 
  actually fires continuously?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does not fire continuously but you can probably use the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.form.resizebegin.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;ResizeBegin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.form.resizeend.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;ResizeEnd&lt;/a&gt; events and be able to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a common misconception: Table variables are NOT necessarily stored in memory. In fact SQL Server decides whether to keep the variable in memory or to spill it to TempDB. There is no reliable way (at least in SQL Server 2005) to ensure that table data is kept in memory.

&lt;p&gt;I'm kinda thinking there isn't :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just tested these steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unpacked the Apache2 source (this should work with Apache 1.3 as well though) and ran &lt;em&gt;./configure --prefix=/opt/apache2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ran &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;sudo make install&lt;/em&gt; to install on the build machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switch to the install directory (/opt/apache2) and tar and gzip up the binaries and config files. I used &lt;em&gt;cd /opt/apache2; sudo tar cf - apache2 | gzip -c &gt; ~/apache2.tar.gz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Move the tar file to the target machine. I decided to install in &lt;em&gt;/opt/mynewdir/dan/apache2&lt;/em&gt; to test. So basically, your clients can't use rpm or anything like that -- unless you know how to make that relocatable (I don't :-) ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, your client's &lt;em&gt;conf/httpd.conf&lt;/em&gt; file will be full of hard-coded absolute paths -- they can just change these to whatever they need. The &lt;em&gt;apachectl&lt;/em&gt; script also has hard coded paths. It's just a shell script so you can hack it or give them a &lt;em&gt;sed&lt;/em&gt; script to convert the old paths from your build machine to the new path on your clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I skipped all that hackery and just ran &lt;em&gt;./bin/httpd -f /opt/mynewdir/dan/conf/httpd.conf&lt;/em&gt; :-)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps. Let us know any error messages you get if it's not working for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit:&lt;/em&gt; Microsoft created a way to prevent XSS attacks by disallowing JavaScript access to cookies if HttpOnly is specified. FireFox later adopted this. So my question is: If you are using AJAX on a site, like StackOverflow, are Http-Only cookies an option?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit 2:&lt;/em&gt; Question 2. If the purpose of HttpOnly is to prevent JavaScript access to cookies, and you can still retrieve the cookies via JavaScript through the XmlHttpRequest Object, &lt;strong&gt;what is the point of HttpOnly&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit 3:&lt;/em&gt; Here is a quote from Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When the browser receives such a cookie, it is supposed to use it as usual in the following HTTP exchanges, but not to make it visible to client-side scripts.[32] The &lt;code&gt;HttpOnly&lt;/code&gt; flag is not part of any standard, and is not implemented in all browsers. Note that there is currently no prevention of reading or writing the session cookie via a XMLHTTPRequest. [33].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that &lt;code&gt;document.cookie&lt;/code&gt; is blocked when you use HttpOnly. But it seems that you can still read cookie values in the XMLHttpRequest object, allowing for XSS. How does HttpOnly make you any safer than? By making cookies essentially read only? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your example, I cannot write to your &lt;code&gt;document.cookie&lt;/code&gt;, but I can still steal your cookie and post it to my domain using the XMLHttpRequest object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script type="text/javascript"&amp;gt;
    var req = null;
    try { req = new XMLHttpRequest(); } catch(e) {}
    if (!req) try { req = new ActiveXObject("Msxml2.XMLHTTP"); } catch(e) {}
    if (!req) try { req = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP"); } catch(e) {}
    req.open('GET', 'http://stackoverflow.com/', false);
    req.send(null);
    alert(req.getAllResponseHeaders());
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit 4:&lt;/em&gt; Sorry, I meant that you could send the XMLHttpRequest to the StackOverflow domain, and then save the result of getAllResponseHeaders() to a string, regex out the cookie, and then post that to an external domain. It appears that Wikipedia and ha.ckers concur with me on this one, but I would love be re-educated...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Edit:&lt;/em&gt; Ahh, apparently both sites are wrong, this is actually a &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=380418"&gt;bug in FireFox&lt;/a&gt;. IE6 &amp;amp; 7 are actually the only browsers that currently fully support HttpOnly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reiterate everything I've learned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HttpOnly restricts all access to document.cookie in IE7 &amp;amp; and FireFox (not sure about other browsers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HttpOnly removes cookie information from the response headers in XMLHttpObject.getAllResponseHeaders() in IE7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XMLHttpObjects may only be submitted to the domain they originated from, so there is no cross-domain posting of the cookies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;edit: This information is likely no longer up to date.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compliance to the &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath"&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Active development and a community participation &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speed. This is really a python wrapper around a C implementation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ubiquity. The libxml2 library is pervasive and thus well tested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Downsides include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compliance to the &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath"&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt;. It's strict. Things like default namespace handling are easier in other libraries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of native code. This can be a pain depending on your how your application is distributed / deployed. RPMs are available that ease some of this pain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manual resource handling. Note in the sample below the calls to freeDoc() and xpathFreeContext(). This is not very Pythonic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are doing simple path selection, stick with &lt;a href="http://effbot.org/zone/element-xpath.htm"&gt;ElementTree&lt;/a&gt; ( which is included in Python 2.5 ). If you need full spec compliance or raw speed and can cope with the distribution of native code, go with libxml2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sample of libxml2 XPath Use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
import libxml2

doc = libxml2.parseFile("tst.xml")
ctxt = doc.xpathNewContext()
res = ctxt.xpathEval("//*")
if len(res) != 2:
    print "xpath query: wrong node set size"
    sys.exit(1)
if res[0].name != "doc" or res[1].name != "foo":
    print "xpath query: wrong node set value"
    sys.exit(1)
doc.freeDoc()
ctxt.xpathFreeContext()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sample of ElementTree XPath Use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;

from elementtree.ElementTree import ElementTree
mydoc = ElementTree(file='tst.xml')
for e in mydoc.findall('/foo/bar'):
    print e.get('title').text

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are running one of these Linux flavours, you might want to recompile Perl from original source (not RPM source).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I realized that anyone running perl code with the distribution perl interpretter on Redhat 5.2, Centos 5.2 or Fedora 9 is likely a victim. Yes, even if your code doesnt use the fancy bless/overload idiom, many CPAN modules do!  This google search shows 1500+ modules use the bless/overload idiom and they include some really popular ones like URI, JSON. ...&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;... At this point, I decided to recompile perl from source.  The bug was gone.  And the difference was appalling.  Everything got seriously fast.  CPUs were chilling at a loadavg below 0.10 and we were processing data 100x to 1000x faster!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;//Oracle tips greatly appreciated.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But since you asked the question with that specific formula, it brought to mind that your result set is really coarse. For the first 333 numbers, the result is: another_16bit_integer-1. You can approximate it (maybe even exactly, when not performed in my head) with something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;16bit_integer = another_16bit_integer - 1 - (another_16bit_integer/334);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could possibly help you to give you hints how to write optimized code in other languages. A lot of that - however - is already done by modern compilers, so I'd only suggest that if you're interested in what's going on inside of that black box.&lt;/p&gt;
