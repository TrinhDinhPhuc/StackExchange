&lt;p&gt;It contains a good description of all of the different cast types. The following taken from the above link:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;const_cast&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;const_cast(expression) The const_cast&amp;lt;&gt;() is used to add/remove
  const(ness) (or volatile-ness) of a variable.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;static_cast&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;static_cast(expression) The static_cast&amp;lt;&gt;() is used to cast between
  the integer types. 'e.g.' char-&gt;long, int-&gt;short etc.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Static cast is also used to cast pointers to related types, for
  example casting void* to the appropriate type.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;dynamic_cast&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Dynamic cast is used to convert pointers and references at run-time,
  generally for the purpose of casting a pointer or reference up or down
  an inheritance chain (inheritance hierarchy).&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;dynamic_cast(expression)&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The target type must be a pointer or reference type, and the
  expression must evaluate to a pointer or reference. Dynamic cast works
  only when the type of object to which the expression refers is
  compatible with the target type and the base class has at least one
  virtual member function. If not, and the type of expression being cast
  is a pointer, NULL is returned, if a dynamic cast on a reference
  fails, a bad_cast exception is thrown. When it doesn't fail, dynamic
  cast returns a pointer or reference of the target type to the object
  to which expression referred.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;reinterpret_cast&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Reinterpret cast simply casts one type bitwise to another. Any pointer
  or integral type can be casted to any other with reinterpret cast,
  easily allowing for misuse. For instance, with reinterpret cast one
  might, unsafely, cast an integer pointer to a string pointer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All HTTP requests from your browser transmit your cookie information for the site in question. JavaScript can both set and read cookies. Cookies are not by definition required for Ajax applications, but they are required for most web applications to maintain user state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The formal answer to your question as phrased - "Does JavaScript need access to cookies if AJAX is used?" - is therefore "no". Think of enhanced search fields that use Ajax requests to provide auto-suggest options, for example. There is no need of cookie information in that case.&lt;/p&gt;

    }
}

&lt;p&gt;As Kevin suggested, use &lt;code&gt;File.separator&lt;/code&gt; to make the directory splitting cross-platform (just tested on Windows and Mac OS X).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;static_cast doesn't do any run time checking of the types involved, which means that unless you know what you are doing, they could be very unsafe. It also only allows casting between related types, such as pointers or references between Base and Derived, or between fundamental types, such as long to int or int to float.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does not allow casts between fundamentally different types, such as a cast between a BaseA and BaseB if they are not related. This will result in a compile time error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Cast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;dynamic_cast will do run time checking as well, and if the instance cannot be cast into another derived type, it will return a null pointer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: dynamic cast works only when the source type is polymorphic.Otherwise, compiler will give an error such as * error: cannot dynamic_cast 'b' (of type 'class base*') to type 'class inh1*' (source type is not polymorphic)*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we have the following classes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class B {};

class D : B {};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then you can do the following&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;B* b = new D();
D* d1 = static_cast&amp;lt;D*&amp;gt;b; // Valid! d1 is a valid and correct pointer to a D
D* d2 = dynamic_cast&amp;lt;D*&amp;gt;b; // Valid! d2 is a valid and correct pointer to a D
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example both pointers d1 and d2 will point to a correct typed version of b&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem comes in the following example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;B* b = new B();
D* d1 = static_cast&amp;lt;D*&amp;gt;b; // Invalid!
D* d2 = dynamic_cast&amp;lt;D*&amp;gt;b; // Valid, but d2 is now a null pointer
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now d1 will point to a data segment of type D*, but the actual data is B*, and will lead to memory issues and corruption.
d2 on the other hand will be a null pointer and can be checked for and handled correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because dynamic_cast performs runtime type checking it is also slower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since dynamic_cast can incurr extra runtime, it can be turned off by instructing the compiler not to include Runtime Type Information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also other cast operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reinterpret Cast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the ultimate cast, which disregards all kind of type safety, allowing you to cast anything to anything else, basically reassigning the type information of the bit pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int i = 12345;
MyClass* p = reinterpret_cast&amp;lt;MyClass*&amp;gt; i;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very dangerous unless you know what you are doing, and is basically the equivilant of C-cast. Like so;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int i = 0;
void *v = 0;
int c = (int)v; // is valid
int d = static_cast&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;(v); // is not valid, different types
int e = reinterpret_cast&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;(v); // is valid, but very dangerous
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then we have the const_cast&amp;lt;&gt; which removes the const-ness of a variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if its elements are exactly those of the input array (see algo below!) and the array is sorted (linear algo for example, but I'm sure we can do worse), then return t;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;otherwise continue looping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To check that two arrays a and b of length n contain the same elements, how about the following recursive algorithm: loop over all couples (i,j) of indices between 0 and n-1, and for each such couple&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;test if a[i]==b[j]:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if so, return TRUE if and only if a recursive call on the lists obtained by removing a[i] from a and b[j] from b returns TRUE;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continue looping over couples, and if all couples are done, return FALSE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time will depend a lot on the distribution of integers in the input array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, though, is there a point to such a question?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Jon, your random sort would be in O(n!) on average (since there are n! permutations, you have probability 1/n! of finding the right one). This holds for arrays of distinct integers, might be slightly different if some elements have multiple occurences in the input array, and would then depend on the distribution of the elements of the input arrays (in the integers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You say you're targeting a "Mobile App" but the reality is that mobile could mean anything from a cell phone with 128x128 resolution to a MID with 800x600 resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no "safe" resolution for such a wide range, and if you're truly targeting all of them you need to design a custom interface for each major resolution.  Add some scaling factors in and you might be able to cut it down to 5-8 different interface designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, the UI means "User Interface" and includes a lot more than just the resolution - you can't count on a touchscreen, full keyboard, or even software keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to either better define your target, or explain your target here so we can better help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that there are millions of phone users that don't have PDA resolutions, and you can really only count on 128x128 or better to cover the majority of technically inclined cell phone users (those that know there's a web browser in their phone, nevermind those that use it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you're prepared to accept these losses, go ahead and hit for 320x240 and 240x320.  That will give you most current PDA phones and up (older blackberries and palm devices had smaller square orientations).  Plan on spending time later supporting lower resolution devices and above all...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do not tie your app to a particular resolution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure your app is flexible enough that you can deploy new UI's without changing internal application logic - in other words separate the presentation from the core logic.  You will find this very useful later - the mobile world changes daily.  Once you gauge how your app is being used you can, for instance, easily deploy an iPhone specific version that is pixel perfect (and prettier than an upscaled 320x240) in order to engage more users.  Being able to do this in a few hours (because you don't have to change the internals) is going to put you miles ahead of the competition if someone else makes a swipe at your market.&lt;/p&gt;

The only way I've been able to do that is create an .ascx control with no code-behind (ie:  all the server-side code is in a script tag in the .ascx file with the runat="server" attribute).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even then, you still have to copy the .ascx file around, so if you ever need to make a change that means updating the file at every location where you've used it.  So yeah, make sure it's in source control.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The iterative algorithm for Fibonacci, because for me it nailed down the fact that the most elegant code (in this case, the recursive version) is not necessarily the most efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The iterative method, (curr = prev1 + prev2 in a forloop) does not tree out this way, nor does it take as much memory since it's only 3 transient variables, instead of n frames in the recursion stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know that fibonacci has a closed form solution that allows direct computation of the result in a fixed number of steps, right?  Namely, (phi&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; - (1 - phi)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;) / sqrt(5).  It always strikes me as somewhat remarkable that this should yield an integer, but it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;phi is the golden ratio, of course; (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2.&lt;/p&gt;

I have heard very successful Java developers state this as a reason they adopted Ruby on Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me personally the problem with Java is it takes too long. I am not referring to execution speed but development speed. I investigated Ruby on Rails because the productivity can be nothing short of amazing. Although the productivity of Rails was apparent, I was horrified at the prospect of throwing away the entire enterprise code base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grails to the rescue! Groovy eliminates much of the verbosity of Java while still being Java. Incorporating Groovy into a Java code base works. Grails makes starting new application development lightning quick. The foundation is built on proven Java projects while the complexity is removed, unless you need it. Use Spring and Hibernate without headaches. The plug-in architecture allows incorporating additional features as needed. Deploy anywhere you have a container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything you put in that Text property will be rendered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I would really like to do is create some sort of attribute which allows me to decorate a method that will &lt;strong&gt;break the build&lt;/strong&gt;. Much like the &lt;em&gt;Obsolete("reason", true)&lt;/em&gt; attribute, but without falsely identifying obsolete code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To clarify&lt;/strong&gt;: I dont want it to break the build on &lt;em&gt;ANY&lt;/em&gt; F6 (Build) press, I only want it to break the build if a method decorated with the attribute is called somewhere else in the code. Like I said, &lt;em&gt;similar&lt;/em&gt; to obsolete, but not the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I am not alone in this, since &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27758/notify-developer-of-a-do-not-use-method#27796" rel="nofollow"&gt;other users want to use it for other reasons&lt;/a&gt;. I have never created custom attributes before so it is all new to me!&lt;/p&gt;

Printing directly to the serial port is likely the most flexible method. In this case we didn't want to replicate all of the work that was already built into the Intermec dll for handling the port, printer errors, etc. We were able to get this working by sending the printer the appropriate codes to switch it into a different mode and then pass direct printer commands that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here was our solution in case anyone else happens to encounter a similar issue working with Intermec Printers. The following code is a test case that doesn't catch printer errors and retry, etc. (See Intermec code examples.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Intermec.Print.LinePrinter lp;

int escapeCharacter = int.Parse("1b", NumberStyles.HexNumber);
char[] toEzPrintMode = new char[] { Convert.ToChar(num2), 'E', 'Z' };

lp = new Intermec.Print.LinePrinter("Printer_Config.XML", "PrinterPB20_40COL");
lp.Open();

lp.Write(charArray2); //switch to ez print mode

string testBarcode = "{PRINT:@75,10:PD417,YDIM 6,XDIM 2,COLUMNS 2, SECURITY 3|ABCDEFGHIJKL|}";
lp.Write(testBarcode);

lp.Write("{LP}"); //switch from ez print mode back to line printer mode

lp.NewLine();
lp.Write("Test"); //verify line printer mode is working
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a technical document on Intermec's support site called the "Technical Manual" that describes the code for directly controlling the printer. The section about Easy Print describes how to print a variety of barcodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has already gained traction in games (physics-engines) and in scientific calculations. If you consider any of those two as "mainstream", than yes, the GPU will become mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most places where I have worked have folowed this practice. I've actually written coding standards for BAE (Aust.) along with the reasons why instead of just carving something in stone with no real justification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerning your question about source files, it's not so much time to compile but more an issue of being able to find the relevant code snippet in the first place. Not everyone is using an IDE. And knowing that you just look for MyClass.h and MyClass.cpp really saves time compared to running "grep MyClass *.(h|cpp)" over a bunch of files and then filtering out the #include MyClass.h statements...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mind you there are work-arounds for the impact of large numbers of source files on compile times. See Large Scale C++ Software Design by John Lakos for an interesting discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might also like to read Code Complete by Steve McConnell for an excellent chapter on coding guidelines. Actualy, this book is a great read that I keep coming back to regularly&lt;/p&gt;

  I can't think of a set-based way to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

select * into GoodDates

The problem with this is that there seems to be no way to insert a conversion between the types, so I can't call a function in one library with the result from a function in the other. If I was the author of either of these, I could create conversions, from the outside, I can't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;library a:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;typedef struct rectangle { sint16 x; sint16 y; uint16 w; uint16 h; } rectangle;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;library b:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Rect {
  int x; int y; int width; int height;
  /* ... */
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I can't make a converter class, because C++ will only look for a conversion in one step. This is probably a good thing, because there would be a lot of possibilities involving creating new objects of all kinds of types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't make an operator that takes the struct from &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and supplies an object of the class from &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;foo.cpp:123 error: operator b::Rect(const rectangle&amp;) must be a nonstatic member function&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, is there a sensible way around this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;edit:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should perhaps also point out that I'd really like some solution that makes working with the result seamless, since I don't expect to be that coder. (Though I agree, old-school, explicit, conversion would have been a good choice. The other branch, &lt;code&gt;reinterpret_cast&lt;/code&gt; has the same problem..)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's usually more efficient (from a compile/link) standpoint to do things this way, especially if you're doing things like incremental link and so forth. The idea being, translation units are isolated such that, when one translation unit changes, you don't have to rebuild a lot of stuff, as you would have to if you started lumping many abstractions into a single translation unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also you'll find many errors/diagnostics are reported via file name ("Error in Myclass.cpp, line 22") and it helps if there's a one-to-one correspondence between files and classes. (Or I suppose you could call it a 2 to 1 correspondence).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find myself rather often in the situation, where I have typed a long commandline and then realize, that I would like to change a word somewhere in the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current approach is to finish the line, press Ctrl-A (to get to the start of the line), insert a # (to comment out the line), press enter and then use the &lt;code&gt;^oldword^newword&lt;/code&gt; syntax (&lt;code&gt;^oldword^newword&lt;/code&gt; executes the previous command after substituting oldword by newword).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there has to be a better (faster) way to achieve this. (The mouse is not possible, since I am in an ssh-sessions most of the time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably there is some emacs-like key-command for this, that I don't know about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I have tried using vi-mode. Something strange happened. Although I am a loving vim-user, I had serious trouble using my beloved bash. All those finger-movements, that have been burned into my subconscious suddenly stopped working. I quickly returned to emacs-mode and considered, giving emacs a try as my favorite editor (although I guess, the same thing might happen again).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For basics, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;% %&gt; is used for pure code blocks.  I generally only use this for if statements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;% if (IsLoggedIn) { %&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    &amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;div class="authenticated"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    &amp;lt;% } else { %&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    &amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;div class="unauthenticated"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    &amp;lt;% } %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;%= Expression %&gt; is used to add text into your markup; that is, it equates to &amp;lt;% Response.Write(Expression) %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;div class='&amp;lt;%= IsLoggedIn ? "authenticated" : "unauthenticated" %&gt;'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;%# Expression %&gt; is very similar to the above, but it is evaluated in a DataBinding scenario.  One thing that this means is that you can use these expressions to set values of runat="server" controls, which you can't do with the &amp;lt;%= %&gt; syntax.  Typically this is used inside of a template for a databound control, but you can also use it in your page, and then call Page.DataBind() (or Control.DataBind()) to cause that code to evaluate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The others mentioned in the linked article are less common, though certainly have their uses, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about using vi mode instead? Just enter set -o vi&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you can go to the word you want to change and just do a cw or cW depending on what's in the word?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oops, forgot to add you enter a ESC k to o to the previous line in the command history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you  normally use for an editor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cheers,
Rob&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: What I forgot to say in my original reply was that you need to think of the vi command line in bash using the commands you enter when you are in "ex" mode in vi, i.e. after you've entered the colon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worst thing is that you need to move around through your command history using the ancient vi commands of h (to the left) and l (to the right). You can use w (or W) to bounce across words though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you get used to it though, you have all sorts of commands available, e.g. entering ESC / my_command will look back through you r history, most recent first, to find the first occurrance of the command line containing the text my_command. Once it has found that, you can then use n to find the next occurrance, etc. And N to reverse the direction of the search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd go have a read of the man page for bash to see what's available under vi mode. Once you get over the fact that up-arrow and down-arrow are replaced by ESC k, and then j, you'll see that vi mode offers more than emacs mode for command line editing in bash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMHO natchurly! (-:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emacs? Eighty megs and constantly swapping!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the HEAD version has the traditional singleton pattern (private constructor, getInstance() etc)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the branch version has no constructor, is a 'public abstract class' and modified all the methods on the object to be 'static'. The code that used to exist in the private constructor is moved into a static block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been working with JSPX pages for over two years and I never had any problems with them being JSPX opposed to JSP. The choice for me to go with JSPX was kinda forced since I use JHeadstart to automatically generate ADF Faces pages and by default, JHeadstart generates everything in JSPX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JSPX specifies that the document has to be a well-formed XML document. This allows stuff to properly and efficiently parse it. I have heard developers say that this helps your pages be more 'future proof' opposed to JSP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Define your command in myclass somewhere as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    public static readonly RoutedCommand Login = new RoutedCommand();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now define your button with this command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &amp;lt;Button Command="{x:Static myclass.Login}"  /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use CommandParameter for extra information..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now last but not least, start listening to your command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the constructor of the class you wish to do some nice stuff, you place:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    CommandBindings.Add(new CommandBinding(myclass.Login, ExecuteLogin));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or in XAML:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;   &amp;lt;UserControl.CommandBindings&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;CommandBinding Command="{x:Static myclass.Login}" Executed="ExecuteLogin" /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/UserControl.CommandBindings&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And  you implement the delegate the CommandBinding needs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    private void ExecuteLogin(object sender, ExecutedRoutedEventArgs e)
    {
          //Your code goes here... e has your parameter!
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can start listening to this command everywhere in your visual tree!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS You can also define the CommandBinding with a CanExecute delegate which will even disable your command if the CanExecute says so :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a good algorithm for parsing equations with precedence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grammar:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't understand the grammar question - I've written this by hand.  It's simple enough that I don't see the need for YACC or Bison.  I merely need to calculate strings with equations such as "2+3 * (42/13)".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm doing this in C, but I'm interested in an algorithm, not a language specific solution.  C is low level enough that it'll be easy to convert to another language should the need arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I posted the &lt;a href="http://www.ubasics.com/simple%5Fc%5Fequation%5Fparser"&gt;test code for the simple expression parser&lt;/a&gt; I was talking about above.  The project requirements altered and so I never needed to optimize the code for performance or space as it wasn't incorporated into the project.  It's in the original verbose form, and should be readily understandable.  If I do anything further with it in terms of operator precedence, I'll probably choose &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28256/equation-expression-parser-with-precedence/783132#783132"&gt;the macro hack&lt;/a&gt; because it matches the rest of the program in simplicity.  If I ever use this in a real project, though, I'll be going for a more compact/speedy parser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to expand on the suggestion from Jon to use -prune. It isn't the easiest of find options to use, for example to just search in the current directory the find command looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;find . \( -type d ! -name . -prune \) -o \( &amp;lt;the bit you want to look for&amp;gt; \)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this will stop find from descending into sub-directories within this directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, it says, "prune anything that is a directory, whose name isn't ".", i.e. current dir."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The find command evals left to right for each item found in the current directory so after completion of the first element, i.e. the prune segment, it will then continue on with the matched item in your second -o (OR'd) expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTH.&lt;/p&gt;

          &amp;lt;Exp&amp;gt; - &amp;lt;Term&amp;gt; |
          &amp;lt;Term&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;Term&amp;gt; ::= &amp;lt;Term&amp;gt; * &amp;lt;Factor&amp;gt; |
           &amp;lt;Term&amp;gt; / &amp;lt;Factor&amp;gt; |
           &amp;lt;Factor&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;Factor&amp;gt; ::= x | y | ... |
             ( &amp;lt;Exp&amp;gt; ) |
             - &amp;lt;Factor&amp;gt; |
             &amp;lt;Number&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;would do the trick for example, and can be trivially augmented to take care of some more complicated expressions (including functions for example, or powers,...).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest you have a look at &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28124/calculating-user-defined-formulas-with-c" rel="nofollow"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; thread, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all introductions to grammars/parsing treat arithmetic expressions as an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that using a grammar does not at all imply using a specific tool (&lt;em&gt;a la&lt;/em&gt; Yacc, Bison,...). Indeed, you most certainly are already using the following grammar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Exp&amp;gt;  :: &amp;lt;Leaf&amp;gt; | &amp;lt;Exp&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Op&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Leaf&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;Op&amp;gt;   :: + | - | * | /

&amp;lt;Leaf&amp;gt; :: &amp;lt;Number&amp;gt; | (&amp;lt;Exp&amp;gt;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(or something of the kind) without knowing it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding your other question, no there are no pitfalls, other than performance. I prefer to use a real PC to do actual coding, using VMs for testing. Clearly, that's not an option for you within OSX. However, you do have the option of Boot Camp if the VM performance becomes an issue for you. That will also let you run Vista with no performance degradation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind that the two virtual machine solutions for the Mac are fairly immature. I've used both, and while they are perfectly adequate for development, I've found both to be flaky, to varying degrees. Parallels seems mostly stable, but does crash and seems to have memory leaks; VMWare is beefer, and sucks more of the system's performance away by default (also seems to perform somewhat better than Parallels), but can have serious graphical problems depending on your setup, particularly if you try to use Unity mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd like to add a scalar function to my script that gets the next available ID (i.e. last used ID + 1) but I'm not sure this is possible because there doesn't seem to be a way to use a global or static variable from within a UDF, I can't use a temp table, and I can't update a permanent table from within a function. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently my script looks like this: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
   declare @v_baseID int 
   exec dbo.getNextID @v_baseID out  --sproc to get the next available id
   --Lots of these - where n is a hardcoded value
   insert into tableOfStuff (someStuff, uniqueID) values ('stuff', @v_baseID + n ) 
   exec dbo.UpdateNextID @v_baseID + lastUsedn  --sproc to update the last used id

&lt;pre&gt;
   --Lots of these
   insert into tableOfStuff (someStuff, uniqueID) values ('stuff', getNextID() )

&lt;p&gt;Hardcoding the offset is a pain in the arse, and is error prone.  Packaging it up into a simple scalar function is very appealing, but I'm starting to think it can't be done that way since there doesn't seem to be a way to maintain the offset counter between calls.  Is that right, or is there something I'm missing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual sproc isn't prefixed with sp_, fixed the example code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In normal usage, we do use an id table and a sproc to get IDs as needed, I was just looking for a cleaner way to do it in this script, which essentially just dumps a bunch of data into the db. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What about late-binding? As in loading
  it with LoadLibrary() and
  GetProcAddress() ? I'm used being able
  to load the library at run time and it
  would be great if you could do that
  here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there are two ways to load the DLL. The first is to reference one or more symbols from the DLL (your classname, for example), supply an appropriate import .LIB and let the linker figure everything out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is to explicitly load the DLL via LoadLibrary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either approach works fine for C-level function exports. You can either let the linker handle it or call GetProcAddress as you noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to exported &lt;strong&gt;classes&lt;/strong&gt;, typically only the first approach is used, i.e., implicitly link to the DLL. In this case the DLL is loaded at application start time, and the application fails to load if the DLL can't be found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to link to a class defined in a DLL, and you want that DLL to be loaded dynamically, sometime after program initiation, you have two options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create objects of the class using a special factory function, which internally will have to use (a tiny bit of) assembler to "hook up" newly created objects to their appropriate offsets. This has to be done at run-time AFTER the DLL has been loaded, obviously. A good explanation of this approach can be found &lt;a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/DLL/classesexportedusingLL.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use a &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/151kt790.aspx"&gt;delay-load DLL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All things considered... probably better to just go with implicit linking, in which case you definitely want to use the preprocessor technique shown above. In fact, if you create a new DLL in Visual Studio and choose the "export symbols" option these macros will be created for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As a consequence, a purely functional program always yields the same value for an input, 
     and the order of evaluation is not well-defined; which means that uncertain values like 
     user input or random values are hard to model in purely functional languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The order of evaluation in a purely functional program may be hard(er) to reason about (especially with laziness) or even unimportant but I think that saying it is not well defined makes it sound like you can't tell if your program is going to work at all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a better explanation would be that control flow in functional programs is based on when the value of a function's arguments are needed. The Good Thing about this that in well written programs, state becomes explicit: each function lists its inputs as parameters instead of arbitrarily &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mung" rel="nofollow"&gt;munging&lt;/a&gt; global state. So on some level, &lt;i&gt;it is easier to reason about order of evaluation with respect to one function at a time&lt;/i&gt;. Each function can ignore the rest of the universe and focus on what it needs to do. When combined, functions are guaranteed to work the same[1] as they would in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

    functional languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution to the input problem in purely functional programs is to embed an imperative language as a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Specific_Language" rel="nofollow"&gt;DSL&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monads_in_functional_programming" rel="nofollow"&gt;a sufficiently powerful abstraction&lt;/a&gt;. In imperative (or non-pure functional) languages this is not needed because you can "cheat" and pass state implicitly and order of evaluation is explicit (whether you like it or not). Because of this "cheating" and forced evaluation of all parameters to every function, in imperative languages 1) you lose the ability to create your own control flow mechanisms (without macros), 2) code isn't inherently thread safe and/or parallelizable &lt;i&gt;by default&lt;/i&gt;, 3) and implementing something like undo (time travel) takes careful work (imperative programmer must store a recipe for getting the old value(s) back!), whereas pure functional programming buys you all these things&amp;mdash;and a few more I may have forgotten&amp;mdash;"for free".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this doesn't sound like zealotry, I just wanted to add some perspective. Imperative programming and especially mixed paradigm programming in powerful languages like C# 3.0 are  still totally effective ways to get things done and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet" rel="nofollow"&gt;there is no silver bullet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] ... except possibly  with respect memory usage (cf. foldl and foldl' in Haskell).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first problem - the key problem - is to get a notification when the db fails over. I don't &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to know because, erm, its mirrored and so it (almost) all carries on working automagically but it would useful to be advised and I'm currently getting failovers when I don't think I should be so it want to know when they occur (without too much digging) to see if I can determine why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have services running that I could fairly easily use to monitor this - so the alternative question would be "How do I programmatically determine which is the principal and which is the mirror" - preferably in a more intelligent fashion than just attempting to connect each in turn (which would mostly work but...).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Murph&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addendum: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the answers queries why I don't need to know when it fails over - the answer is that we're developing using ADO.NET and that has automatic failover support, all you have to do is add &lt;code&gt;Failover Partner=MIRRORSERVER&lt;/code&gt; (where MIRRORSERVER is the name of your mirror server instance) to your connection string and your code will fail over transparently - you may get some errors depending on what connections are active but in our case very few.&lt;/p&gt;

I may do various things to create the DDL in the first place but fundamentally I do all the schema maint in code. This also means that if one needs to do non DDL things that don't map well to SQL you can write procedural logic and run it between lumps of DDL/DML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dbs then have a table which defines the current version so one can code a relatively straightforward set of tests:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the DB exist? If not create it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the DB the current version? If not then run the methods, in sequence, that bring the schema up to date (you may want to prompt the user to confirm and - ideally - do backups at this point).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the contributors here are part of the "No Silver Bullet" camp (I am definitely). If MDA worked (equals to "huge savings"), we would know it, that is for sure. The question is: how far "meta" can you go while keeping your system manageable? This was the turning point in UML 2.0 when they introduced a more formal meta-meta-model. So far, I haven't seen a real world usage of the modelisation power of UML 2.0 (but my world is rather limited). Besides, you have only two choices with a model-driven approach: generate code, or having a runtime exploiting your model. The ultimate constraint-free code generator is called "human", whereas the ultimate runtimes where found in the 4GLs (what is the current number nowadays?). Maybe that would explain the lack of enthousiasm.&lt;/p&gt;

    curl_close($httpRequest);

  &lt;p&gt;thinking about it, you have 64 bit representing a number greater than 2^64 (double.maxvalue), so inaccuracy is expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2^64 is not the maximum value of a double.  2^64 is the number of unique values that a double (or any other 64-bit type) can hold.  &lt;code&gt;Double.MaxValue&lt;/code&gt; is equal to 1.79769313486232e308.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inaccuracy with floating point numbers doesn't come from representing values larger than &lt;code&gt;Double.MaxValue&lt;/code&gt; (which is impossible, excluding &lt;code&gt;Double.PositiveInfinity&lt;/code&gt;).  It comes from the fact that the desired range of values is simply too large to fit into the datatype.  So we give up precision in exchange for a larger effective range.  In essense, we are dropping significant digits in return for a larger exponent range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@DrPizza&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Not even; the IEEE encodings use multiple encodings for the same values. Specifically, NaN is represented by an exponent of all-bits-1, and then any non-zero value for the mantissa. As such, there are 252 NaNs for doubles, 223 NaNs for singles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True.  I didn't account for duplicate encodings.  There are actually 2&lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;-1 NaNs for doubles and 2&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;-1 NaNs for singles, though.  :p&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Structure your source directory structure so that you can package your build by copying whole directories, rather than naming individual files. For example, if you are copying JAR files to a web application archive, do something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;copy todir="${war}/WEB-INF/lib" flatten="true"&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;fileset dir="lib" includes="**/*.jar"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/copy&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use properties files for machine-specific and project-specific build file properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Machine-specific property over-rides --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;property file="/etc/ant/build.properties" /&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;!-- Project-specific property over-rides --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;property file="build.properties" /&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;!-- Default property values, used if not specified in properties files --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;property name="jboss.home" value="/usr/share/jboss" /&amp;gt;
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that Ant properties cannot be changed once set, so you override a value by defining a new value &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the default value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not clear on what your requirements are for passing types between C/C++ and python, but you can do that easily by either exposing a C++ type to python, or by using a generic &lt;a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_35_0/libs/python/doc/v2/object.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;boost::python::object&lt;/a&gt; argument to your C++ API. You can also register converters to automatically convert python types to C++ types and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you plan use boost.python, the &lt;a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_35_0/libs/python/doc/tutorial/doc/html/index.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; is a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have implemented something somewhat similar to what you need. I have a C++ function that 
accepts a python function and an image as arguments, and applies the python function to each pixel in the image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Image* unary(boost::python::object op, Image&amp;amp; im)
{
    Image* out = new Image(im.width(), im.height(), im.channels());
    for(unsigned int i=0; i&amp;lt;im.size(); i++)
    {
        (*out)[i] == extract&amp;lt;float&amp;gt;(op(im[i]));
    }
    return out;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, Image is a C++ object exposed to python (an image with float pixels), and op is a python defined function  (or really any python object with a &amp;#95;&amp;#95;call&amp;#95;&amp;#95; attribute). You can then use this function as follows (assuming unary is located in the called image that also contains Image and a load function):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import image
im = image.load('somefile.tiff')
double_im = image.unary(lambda x: 2.0*x, im)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for using arrays with boost, I personally haven't done this, but I know the functionality to expose arrays to python using boost is available - &lt;a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_35_0/libs/python/doc/v2/faq.html#question2" rel="nofollow"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; might be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My rule of thumb is to make the class unit testable.  If your class relies on the implementation details of another class, that needs to be refactored/abstracted to the point that the classes can be tested in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good rule of thumb is that if its too hard to test, you've got some issues with single responsibility and static dependencies.  Isolate code that performs a single function into a class and break that static dependency by extracting an interface and using a DI framework to inject the correct instance at runtime.

&lt;p&gt;So in this case, yes, spend a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; bit of time developing a prototype app that you can send out there to a few people and get feedback.  They will have better feedback because they can try it out, and you will have a springboard to start from.  The ability to quickly release UI updates without changing core logic will allow you test several interfaces quickly without a huge time investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, to customers you will seem really responsive to their needs, which will be a big benefit to people who's jobs depend on reaction time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Does this If function perform better than the IIf function?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely. Remember, it's built into the language. Only one of the two conditional arguments has to be evaluated, potentially saving a costly operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Does the If statement trump the If and IIf functions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you can't compare the two because they do different things. If your code semantically performs an assignment you should emphasize this, instead of the decision-making. Use the &lt;code&gt;If&lt;/code&gt; operator here instead of the statement. This is especially true if you can use it in the initialization of a variable because otherwise the variable will be default initialized, resulting in slower code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Dim result = If(a &amp;gt; 0, Math.Sqrt(a), -1.0)

' versus

Dim result As Double ' Redundant default initialization!
If a &amp;gt; 0 Then
    result = Math.Sqrt(a)
Else
    result = -1
End If
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

You'll be able to see very clearly how your dependency chains work and be able to make changes to individual parts without requiring you to change things that are unrelated.  You'll end up with a loosely coupled application.  This will push you into a better design and you'll be surprised when you can keep making improvements because your design will help you keep separating and organizing code going forward.  It can also facilitate unit testing because you now have a natural way to substitute implementations of particular interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

This is an example of what a call might look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$.ajax({
    url: "userCreation.ashx",
    data: { u:userName, p:password, e:email },
    type: "POST",
    beforeSend: function(){disableSubmitButton();},

            displayUserCreatedMessage();
            refreshUserList();
        }
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The request might fail for a number of reasons, such as duplicate user name, duplicate email address etc, and the ashx is written to throw an exception when this happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My problem seems to be that by throwing an exception the ashx causes the statusText and errorThrown to be undefined. I can get to the XMLHttpRequest.responseText which contains the HTML that makes up the standard .net error page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am finding the page title in the responseText and using the title to work out which error was thrown. Although I have a suspicion that this will fall apart when I enable custom error handling pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I be throwing the errors in the ashx, or should I be returning a status code as part of the data returned by the call to userCreation.ashx, then using this to decide what action to take? How do you handle these situations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, if possible, I would prefer to handle this on the server side and work up a message to the user there. This works very well in a scenario where you only want to display a message to the user telling them what happened (validation message, essentially).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you want to perform an action based on what happened on the server, you may want to use a status code and write some javascript to perform various actions based on that status code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Also, in this particular situation, I'm not sure why you would need to be concerned with preventing a person from subclassing. If someone has access to your PHP code to subclass it, then they also have access to your code to copy it and change access modifiers to something that they (for whatever reason) find suitable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practical usefulness of the Singleton in this case is that, by using it, you can ensure that you're always using the same database connection for a given HTTP request. It accomplishes that. The other stuff (using &lt;code&gt;final&lt;/code&gt; and private constructors) is useful to know from a theory perspective, and even more useful to know if you want to distribute API-quality code to other programmers, but in the case of this particular example, all the keywords are doing is adding bytes to your class file's size.&lt;/p&gt;

You could embed LGPL, BSD, MIT, Artistic licenced code. The "price" might be having to give credit, but that would be way cheaper than actually writing and debugging the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three routes;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSx86"&gt;OSx86&lt;/a&gt; (aka iATKOS / Kalyway) on a second partition/disk and dual boot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run Mac OS X Server under VMWare (Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) onwards, read the update below).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Delphi XE4 and the macincloud service. This is a commercial tool set, but the component and lib support is growing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first route requires modifying (or using a pre-modified) image of Leopard that can be installed on a regular PC. This is not as hard as you would think, although your success/effort ratio will depend upon how closely the hardware in your PC matches that in Mac hardware - e.g. if you're running a Core 2 Duo on an Intel Motherboard, with a NVidia graphics card you are laughing. If you're running an AMD machine or something without SSE3 it gets a little more involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you purchase (or already own) a version of Leopard then this is a gray area since the Leopard EULA states you may only run it on an "Apple Labeled" machine. As many point out if you stick an Apple sticker on your PC you're probably covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second option is the more costly. The EULA for the workstation version of Leopard prevents it from being run under emulation and as a result there's no support in VMWare for this. Leopard server however CAN be run under emulation and can be used for desktop purposes. Leopard server and VMWare are expensive however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in option 1) I would suggest starting at &lt;a href="http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/"&gt;Insanelymac&lt;/a&gt; and reading the OSx86 sections. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do think you should consider whether the time you will invest is going to be worth the money you will save though. It was for me because I enjoy tinkering with this type of stuff and I started during the early iPhone betas, months before their App Store became available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively you could pickup a low-spec Mac Mini from eBay. You don't need much horse power to run the SDK and you can always sell it on later if you decide to stop development or buy a better Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: You cannot create a Mac OS X Client virtual machine for OS X 10.6 and earlier. Apple does not allow these Client OSes to be virtualized. With Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) onwards, Apple has changed their licensing agreement in regards to virtualization.

As such, there are 2&lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt; NaNs for doubles, 2&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; NaNs for singles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't new/delete an object when an automatic object will do just fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have found that programmers who are new to C++, or programmers coming over from languages like Java, seem to learn about new and then obsessively use it whenever they want to create any object, regardless of the context. This is especially pernicious when an object is created locally within a function purely to do something useful. Using new in this way can be detrimental to performance and can make it all too easy to introduce silly memory leaks when the corresponding delete is forgotten. Yes, smart pointers can help with the latter but it won't solve the performance issues (assuming that new/delete or an equivalent is used behind the scenes). Interestingly (well, maybe), we have found that delete often tends to be more expensive than new when using Visual C++.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of this confusion also comes from the fact that functions they call might take pointers, or even smart pointers, as arguments (when references would perhaps be better/clearer). This makes them think that they need to "create" a pointer (a lot of people seem to think that this is what new does) to be able to pass a pointer to a function. Clearly, this requires some rules about how APIs are written to make calling conventions as unambiguous as possible, which are reinforced with clear comments supplied with the function prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class Button : System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button, IMyButtonInterface { ... }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the codebehind of a page, I'd like to find all instances of this button from the ASPX. Because I don't really know what the &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; is going to be, just the &lt;em&gt;interface&lt;/em&gt; it implements, that's all I have to go on when looping through the control tree. Thing is, I've never had to determine if an object uses an interface versus just testing its type. &lt;strong&gt;How can I loop through the control tree and yank anything that implements IMyButtonInterface in a clean way&lt;/strong&gt; (Linq would be fine)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, know it's something obvious, but just now started using interfaces heavily and I can't seem to focus my Google results enough to figure it out :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; GetType() returns the actual class, but doesn't return the interface, so I can't test on that (e.g., it'd return "MyNamespace.Button" instead of "IMyButtonInterface"). In trying to use "as" or "is" in a recursive function, the &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; parameter doesn't even get recognized within the function! It's rather bizarre. So&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if(ctrl.GetType() == typeToFind) //ok

if(ctrl is typeToFind) //typeToFind isn't recognized! eh?

&lt;p&gt;Interesting trivia: The stopwatch falls back on &lt;code&gt;DateTime.UtcNow&lt;/code&gt; if your hardware doesn't support a high frequency counter.

&lt;p&gt;Oh, it's Maven 2. I was afraid that someone was still seriously using Maven nowadays. Leaving the jokes aside: if you decide to switch to Maven 2, you have to take care while looking for information, because Maven 2 is a complete reimplementation of Maven, with some fundamental design decisions changed.

I am working on Linux machine and the FileMaker database is on the same LAN running on an OS X machine. I can log into the webby interface from my machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm quite handy with SQL, and if somebody could point me to some FileMaker plug-in that could give me SQL access to the data within FileMaker, I would be pleased as punch. Everything I've found only goes the other way: Having FileMaker get data from SQL sources. Not useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not my first choice, but I'd use Perl instead of Python if there was a Perl-y solution at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt;: XML/XSLT services (as suggested by some folks) are only available on FM Server, not FM Pro. Otherwise, that would probably be the best solution. ODBC is turning out to be extremely difficult to even get working. There is absolutely zero feedback from FM when you set it up so you have to dig through /var/log/system.log and parse obscure error messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;: I got it working by running a python script locally on the machine that queries the FM database through the ODBC connections. The script is actually a TCPServer that accepts socket connections from other systems on the LAN, runs the queries, and returns the data through the socket connection. I had to do this to bypass the fact that FM Pro only accepts ODBC connections locally (FM server is required for external connections).&lt;/p&gt;

The problem with learning C within Visual Studio is that you are compiling C 
using the Visual Studio C++ compiler. You might want to try learning C using
the GNU GCC compiler from within the Cygwin environment in Windows.
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a legitimate response, I posted an IDE that uses the GNU compilers, so why has he been down modded?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the type of thing that will make me &lt;strong&gt;not use&lt;/strong&gt; SO, why down mod someone just because they are recommending a different compiler, and IMHO, a better one then Microsoft's?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FYI, the .NET Timer class is not for diagnostics, it generates events at a preset interval, like this (from &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.timers.timer.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;MSDN&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;System.Timers.Timer aTimer;
public static void Main()
{
    // Create a timer with a ten second interval.
    aTimer = new System.Timers.Timer(10000);

    // Hook up the Elapsed event for the timer.
    aTimer.Elapsed += new ElapsedEventHandler(OnTimedEvent);

    // Set the Interval to 2 seconds (2000 milliseconds).
    aTimer.Interval = 2000;
    aTimer.Enabled = true;

    Console.WriteLine("Press the Enter key to exit the program.");
    Console.ReadLine();
}

// Specify what you want to happen when the Elapsed event is 
// raised.
private static void OnTimedEvent(object source, ElapsedEventArgs e)
{
    Console.WriteLine("The Elapsed event was raised at {0}", e.SignalTime);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this really doesn't help you know how long something took, just that a certain amount of time has passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timer is also exposed as a control in System.Windows.Forms... you can find it in your designer tool box in VS05/VS08&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with the "use it when you have to" brigade. Decorating code unnecessarily with &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; isn't a great idea because the compiler won't warn you when you forget to do it. This introduces potential confusion for people expecting &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; to always be there, i.e. they'll have to &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when would you use it? I've just had a look around some random code and found these examples (I'm not passing judgement on whether these are &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; things to do or otherwise):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passing "yourself" to a function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assigning "yourself" to a pointer or something like that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Casting, i.e. up/down casting (safe or otherwise), casting away constness, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compiler enforced disambiguation.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;BREAKING CHANGES from NH1.2.1GA to NH2.0.0&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.NET 1.1 is no longer supported&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nullables.NHibernate is no longer supported (use nullable types of .NET 2.0)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compile time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;NHibernate.Expression namespace was renamed to NHibernate.Criterion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IInterceptor have additional methods. (IsUnsaved was renamed IsTransient)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;INamingStrategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IType&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;IVersionType&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IBatcher&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;IPropertyAccessor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ValueTypeType renamed to PrimitiveType&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Possible Breaking Changes for external frameworks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various classes were moved between namespaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various classes have been renamed (to match Hibernate 3.2 names)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ISession interface have additional methods&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;ICacheProvider&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ICriterion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CriteriaQueryTranslator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Initialization time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;nhibernate&amp;gt; section, in App.config, is no longer supported and will be ignored. Configuration schema for configuration file and App.config is now identical, and the App.config section name is: &amp;lt;hibernate-configuration&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;hibernate-configuration&amp;gt; have a different schema and all properties names are cheked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;configuration properties are no longer prefixed by hibernate., if before you would specify hibernate.dialect, now you specify just dialect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All named queries will be validated at initialization time, an exception will be thrown if any is not valid (can be disabled if needed)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stricter checks for proxying classes (all public methods must be virtual)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Run time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SaveOrUpdateCopy() returns a new instance of the entity without changing the original&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;AutoFlush will not occur outside a transaction - Database transactions are never optional, all communication with the database must occur inside a transaction, whatever you read or write data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NHibernate will return long for count(*) queries on SQL Server&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;while x=next():
    // do something here!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since that's not possible, there are a number of "idiomatically correct" ways of doing this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;while 1:
    x = next()
    if x != END:
        // Blah
    else:
        break
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this is kind of ugly. You can also use one of the "iterator" approaches listed above, but, again, that may not be ideal. Finally, you can use the "pita pocket" approach that I actually just found while googling:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Pita( object ):
    __slots__ = ('pocket',)
    marker = object()
    def __init__(self, v=marker):
        if v is not self.marker:
            self.pocket = v
    def __call__(self, v=marker):
        if v is not self.marker:
            self.pocket = v
        return self.pocket
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;p = Pita()
while p( next() ) != END:
    // do stuff with p.pocket!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for this question; learning about the &lt;code&gt;__call__&lt;/code&gt; idiom was really cool! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ctrl is IInterfaceToFind
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;instead of  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ctrl.GetType() == aTypeVariable
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why is that if you use .GetType(), you will get the true type of an object, not necessarily what it can also be cast to in its inheritance/Interface implementation chain. Also, .GetType() will never return an abstract type/interface since you can't new up an abstract type or interface. GetType() returns concrete types only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason this doesn't work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if(ctrl is typeToFind)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is because the type of the variable typeToFind is actually System.RuntimeType, not the type you've set its value to. Example, if you set a string's value to "foo", its type is still string not "foo". I hope that makes sense. It's very easy to get confused when working with types. I'm chronically confused when working with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most import thing to note about longhorn213's answer is that &lt;strong&gt;you have to use recursion&lt;/strong&gt; or you may miss some of the controls on the page. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Out of curiosity, what are you trying
  to accomplish?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was trying out development for the Game Boy Advance. I was reading about its DMA system and I experimented with it by creating single-color tile bitmaps. The idea was to have the indexed color be passed as an argument to a function which would use DMA to fill a tile with that color. The source address for the DMA transfer is stored at &lt;code&gt;0x40000d4&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Personally, I might do try this to see
  if it compiled better:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void foo(unsigned int x) 
{
    volatile unsigned int* pArg = &amp;amp;x;
    *(volatile unsigned int*)(0x4000000 + 0xd4) = (unsigned int)pArg;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;-O0&lt;/code&gt; that works as well and with &lt;code&gt;-O1&lt;/code&gt; that is optimized to the exact same &lt;code&gt;-O1&lt;/code&gt; assembly I've posted in my question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above method gets the user's working directory when the application was launched. This is fine if the application is launched by a script or shortcut that ensures that this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if the app is launched from somewhere else (entirely possible if the command line is used), then the return value will be wherever the user was when they launched the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Workflow-like architecture. Where you can connect several components dynamically connecting the output of a component to the input of another one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Per-client application. Let's say you have various clients which pays for a set of "features" of your project. By using dependency injection you can easily provide just the core components and some "added" components which provide just the features the client have paid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translation. Although this is not usually done for translation purposes, you can "inject" different language files as needed by the application. That includes RTL or LTR user interfaces as needed.&lt;/li&gt;

Basically, this mechanism uses the OS's virtual memory paging system to 'map' your buffer directly to disk.  The OS will manage moving the bytes to/from disk and memory auto-magically, very quickly, and you won't have to worry about changing your virtual machine options.  This will also allow you to take advantage of NIO's improved performance over traditional java stream-based i/o, without any weird hacks.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only two catches that I can think of are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's wrong. I mean, C++ as a whole is not compatible across different OSes (most platforms have a clear and well-defined C ABI, not so C++, especially when you get into details like virtual inheritance representations and so on).  Templates don't change anything on that front; instantiated templates are just classes with funny names.&lt;/p&gt;

However, for applications with complex OO hierarchies, a &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataMapper.html"&gt;DataMapper&lt;/a&gt; is probably a better solution.

In his &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/"&gt;book on patterns&lt;/a&gt;, Martin Fowler points out that ActiveRecord tends to break down under conditions where your Model is fairly complex, and suggests a &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataMapper.html"&gt;DataMapper&lt;/a&gt; as the alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I do it is to have "domain" objects that are accessed by your controllers via these DataMapper (or "service layer") classes. These do not directly mirror the database, but act as your OO representation for some real-world object. Say you have a User class in your domain, and need to have references to, or collections of other objects, already loaded when you retrieve that User object. The data may be coming from many different tables, and an ActiveRecord pattern can make it really hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of loading the User object directly and accessing data using an ActiveRecord style API, your controller code retrieves a User object by calling the API of the UserMapper.getUser() method, for instance. It is that mapper that is responsible for loading any associated objects from their respective tables and returning the completed User "domain" object to the caller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, you are just adding another layer of abstraction to make the code more managable. Whether your DataMapper classes contain raw custom SQL, or calls to a data abstraction layer API, or even access an ActiveRecord pattern themselves, doesn't really matter to the controller code that is receiving a nice, populated User object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that's how I do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lambdas don't need to return anything&lt;/strong&gt; and type inference is extremely powerful in context like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And BTW, you can always return &lt;strong&gt;Lambdas that make Lambdas&lt;/strong&gt; in the functional programming sense. For example, here's a lambda that makes a lambda that handles a Button.Click event:&lt;/p&gt;

    (dx, dy) =&amp;gt; (sender, e) =&amp;gt; {

        btn.Top += dy;
        btn.Left += dx;
    };

btnUp.Click += makeHandler(0, -1);
btnDown.Click += makeHandler(0, 1);
btnLeft.Click += makeHandler(-1, 0);
btnRight.Click += makeHandler(1, 0);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the chaining: &lt;code&gt;(dx, dy) =&amp;gt; (sender, e) =&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that's why I'm happy to have taken the functional programming class :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Expression Web (code-named Quartz) - WYSIWYG website designer and HTML editor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Expression Blend (code-named Sparkle) - Visual user interface builder for Windows Presentation Foundation and Silverlight applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Expression Design (code-named Acrylic) - Raster and vector graphics editor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Expression Media - Digital asset and media manager.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Expression Encoder - VC-1 content professional encoder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For web development Expression Web is useful. For XAML development, Blend and Design are useful.&lt;/p&gt;

There is definitely not a VBScript engine I've ever heard of nor JScript.

It consists of a bunch of design software that Microsoft has bought for the most part. The audience is designers, not developers. The gist of the software is that Expression Blend enables designers and programmers to work seamlessly together in letting the designer create the graphical user interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a normal workflow, the designer would deliver a mockup which the developer would have to implement. Using Expression Blend in combination with WPF, this is no longer necessary. The graphical UI made by the designer is functional. All the developer has to do is write the code for the function behind the design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This in itself is great because developers invariably fail to implement the design as thought out by the designer. Technical limitations, lack of communication  whatever the reason. UIs never look like them mockup done up front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expression Design is basically a vector drawing program that can be used to design smaller components that are then used within Expression Blend as parts of the UI. For example, graphical buttons could be designed that way. It can also be used as a vanilla drawing program. I did the graphics in my thesis using Expression Design.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Good suggestions, but rest assured, we have tried all of the usual troubleshooting. What I'm hoping is that this is a .NET issue that someone might know about, that we can work on solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My feeling is that no matter how bizarre the underlying cause, the usual troubleshooting steps are your best bet for locating the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is a performance issue, good measurements are invaluable.  The overall process CPU usage is far too broad a measurement.  &lt;em&gt;Where&lt;/em&gt; is your service spending its time?  You could use a profiler to measure this, or just log various section start and stops.  If you aren't able to do even that, then use Andrea Bertani's suggestion -- isolate sections by removing others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you've located the general area, then you can make even finer-grained measurements, until you sort out the source of the CPU usage.  If it's not obvious how to fix it at that point, you at least have ammunition for a much more specific question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have in fact already done all this usual troubleshooting, please do let us in on the secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's the theory / product strategy side of it. In reality, if you're performing both roles, you'll end up having your project open in both Expression Blend and Visual Studio, switching back and forth between them depending on whether you're doing "designer tasks" or "developer tasks".

If you have to, use reference counting for objects that are long-lived and need to be shared between diverse parts of your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you need to allocate objects dynamically, but they will only be used within a certain span of time. For example, in a previous project I needed to create a complex in-memory representation of a database schema -- basically a complex cyclic graph of objects. However, the graph was only needed for the duration of a database connection, after which all the nodes could be freed in one shot. In this kind of scenario, a good pattern to use is something I call the "local GC idiom." I'm not sure if it has an "official" name, as it's something I've only seen in my own code, and in Cocoa (see &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSAutoreleasePool_Class/Reference/Reference.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;NSAutoreleasePool&lt;/a&gt; in Apple's Cocoa reference).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, you create a "collector" object that keeps pointers to the temporary objects that you allocate using new. It is usually tied to some scope in your program, either a static scope (e.g. -- as a stack-allocated object that implements the RAII idiom) or a dynamic one (e.g. -- tied to the lifetime of a database connection, as in my previous project). When the "collector" object is freed, its destructor frees all of the objects that it points to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, like DrPizza I think the restriction to not use templates is too harsh. However, having done a lot of development on ancient versions of Solaris, AIX, and HP-UX (just recently - yes, these platforms are still alive in the Fortune 50), I can tell you that if you really care about portability, you should use templates as little as possible. Using them for containers and smart pointers ought to be ok, though (it worked for me). Without templates the technique I described is more painful to implement. It would require that all objects managed by the "collector" derive from a common base class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had issues with not being able to use absolute paths with CVS. I don't know if this is a weirdness of our local set up here, or if  it's a global CVS thing. So, I've made a configurable variable that you can put in your .vimrc to use relative path instead.&lt;/p&gt;

It's better to add the index after the fact and let the database engine reorder the rows when it knows how the data is distributed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, let's say you needed to build a brick wall with numbered bricks so that those with the highest number are at the bottom of the wall. It would be a difficult task if you were just handed the bricks in random order, one at a time - you wouldn't know which bricks were going to turn out to be the highest numbered, and you'd have to tear the wall down and rebuild it over and over. It would be a lot easier to handle that task if you had all the bricks lined up in front of you, and could organize your work.&lt;/p&gt;

  the traditional sort order that uses native byte values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which might explain things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If some of your systems have no locale support, they would default to that locale (C), so you wouldn't have to set it on those. If you have some that supports locales and want the same behavior, set &lt;code&gt;LC_ALL=C&lt;/code&gt; on those systems. That would be the way to have as many systems as I know do it the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't have any locale-less systems, just making sure they share locale would probably be enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might still not understand, but you can use any type you want (for example, doubles) to represent time (if what you actually want is to represent the discretization of time for your physics problem, in which case the tick is irrelevant). For most physics problems, doubles would be sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it's because enumerating the collection might be slow, then there is no solution that will be faster. You might want to consider using an ICollection instead if possible. Unless the enumeration is remarkably slow (e.g. it reads items from disk) speed shouldn't be a problem though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it's because enumerating the collection will require more code then it's already been written for you in the form of the .Count() extension method. Just use MyEnumerable.Count().&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it's because you want to be able to enumerate the collection after you've counted then the .Count() extension method allows for this. You can even call .Count() on a collection you're in the middle of enumerating and it will carry on from where it was before the count. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;foreach (int item in Series.Generate(5))
{
    Console.WriteLine(item + "(" + myEnumerable.Count() + ")");
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;will give the results&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;0 (5)&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;1 (5)&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;2 (5)&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;3 (5)&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;4 (5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it's because the enumeration has side effects (e.g. writes to disk/console) or is dependant on variables that may change between counting and enumerating (e.g. reads from disk) [N.B. If possible, I would suggest rethinking the architecture as this can cause a lot of problems] then one possibility to consider is reading the enumeration into an intermittent storage. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; seriesAsList = Series.Generate(5).ToList();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the above assume you can't change the type (i.e. it is returned from a library that you do not own). If possible you might want to consider changing to use an ICollection or IList (ICollection being more widely scoped than IList) which has a Count property on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real power tool of Cocoa development is Interface Builder.  IB does not generate source code like many UI tools.  Instead it manipulates real Cocoa views, controls, and objects which it then bundles into an archive (nib) that is loaded by your program at runtime.  Most Cocoa programs use at least one nib file, and often many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what IDE/editor combination you choose for hacking on source files, I recommend using IB where you can.

&lt;p&gt;I'm writing an app that will watch for any changes in a specific directory. This directory will be flooded with thousands of files a minute each with an "almost" unique GUID. The file format is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GUID.dat where GUID == xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 
(the internal contents aren't relevant, but it's just text data)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My app will be a form that has one single text box that shows all the files that are being added and deleted in real time. Every time a new file comes in I have to update the textbox with this file, BUT I must first make sure that this semi-unique GUID is really unique, if it is, update the textbox with this new file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a file is removed from that directory, make sure it exists, then delete it, update textbox accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that I've been using the .NET filewatcher and it seems that there is an internal buffer that gets blown up every time the (buffersize + 1)-th file comes in. I also tried to keep an internal List in my app, and just add every single file that comes in, but do the unique-GUID check later, but no dice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone have any advice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous to that the various options &lt;a href="http://www.julienlecomte.net/blog/2007/08/13/"&gt; were as follow &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically &lt;a href="http://dean.edwards.name/packer/"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt; does a better job at initial compression , but if you are going to gzip the files before sending on the wire (which you should be doing) &lt;a href="http://www.julienlecomte.net/yuicompressor/"&gt;YUI Compressor&lt;/a&gt; gets the smallest final size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tests were done on jQuery code btw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Original jQuery library 62,885 bytes , 19,758 bytes after gzip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jQuery minified with JSMin 36,391 bytes , 11,541 bytes after gzip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jQuery minified with Packer 21,557 bytes , 11,119 bytes after gzip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jQuery minified with the YUI Compressor 31,822 bytes  , 10,818 bytes after gzip&lt;/li&gt;

I assume the same thing to be true for TRACE.  That is, the System.Diagnostics.Debug functions must have ConditionalAttributes for DEBUG and for TRACE.  I was wrong in that assumption.  The separate Trace class has the same functions, and these define ConditionalAttribute dependent on the TRACE constant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I've also learned here from you guys, and verified, that the RELEASE build does not in itself take care of this.  At least with Silverlight projects, which are still a little flaky, you need to get into the "Advanced Compile Options..." and make sure DEBUG is not defined.  &lt;/p&gt;

The counters available however do not provide a CPU % Utilization counter or something similar, although there are some rate counters, that you could use to get a good estimate of CPU.  Example would be, if you have 2 databases, and the rate measured is 20 transactions/sec on database A and 80 trans/sec on database B --- then you would know that A contributes roughly to 20% of the total CPU, and B contributes to other 80%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's bad to try to collect the garbage because it's not really your garbage. You have told the VM to allocate some memory when you created objects, and the garbage collector is hiding information about those objects. Internally the GC is performing optimisations on the memory allocations it makes. When you manually try to collect the garbage you have no knowledge about what the GC wants to hold onto and get rid of, you are just forcing it's hand. As a result you mess up internal calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Take a bunch of data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform some kind of transformation that converts every datum to another kind of datum&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combine those new data into yet simpler data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 2 is Map. Step 3 is Reduce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get time between two impulses on a pair of pressure meters on the road&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Map those times into speeds based upon the distance of the meters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce those speeds to an average speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason MapReduce is split between Map and Reduce is because different parts can easily be done in parallel. (Especially if Reduce has certain mathematical properties.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a complex but good description of MapReduce, see: &lt;a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.104.5859&amp;amp;rep=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf"&gt;Google's MapReduce Programming Model -- Revisited (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type safety&lt;/strong&gt;: I think we all understand this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstraction&lt;/strong&gt;: This is especially true with &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386964.aspx"&gt;LINQ-to-Entities&lt;/a&gt;.  This abstraction also allows the framework to add additional improvements that you can easily take advantage of.  &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163329.aspx"&gt;PLINQ&lt;/a&gt; is an example of adding multi-threading support to LINQ.  Code changes are minimal to add this support.  It would be MUCH harder to do this data access code that simply calls sprocs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debugging support&lt;/strong&gt;: I can use any .NET debugger to debug the queries.  With sprocs, you cannot easily debug the SQL and that experience is largely tied to your database vendor (MS SQL Server provides a query analyzer, but often that isn't enough).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vendor agnostic&lt;/strong&gt;: LINQ works with lots of databases and the number of supported databases will only increase.  Sprocs are not always portable between databases, either because of varying syntax or feature support (if the database supports sprocs at all).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deployment&lt;/strong&gt;: Others have mentioned this already, but it's easier to deploy a single assembly than to deploy a set of sprocs.  This also ties in with #4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easier&lt;/strong&gt;: You don't have to learn T-SQL to do data access, nor do you have to learn the data access API (e.g. ADO.NET) necessary for calling the sprocs.  This is related to #3 and #4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some disadvantages of LINQ vs sprocs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network traffic&lt;/strong&gt;: sprocs need only serialize sproc-name and argument data over the wire while LINQ sends the entire query.  This can get really bad if the queries are very complex.  However, LINQ's abstraction allows Microsoft to improve this over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less flexible&lt;/strong&gt;: Sprocs can take full advantage of a database's featureset.  LINQ tends to be more generic in it's support.  This is common in any kind of language abstraction (e.g. C# vs assembler).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recompiling&lt;/strong&gt;: If you need to make changes to the way you do data access, you need to recompile, version, and redeploy your assembly.  Sprocs can &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt; allow a DBA to tune the data access routine without a need to redeploy anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security and manageability are something that people argue about too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt;: For example, you can protect your sensitive data by restricting access to the tables directly, and put ACLs on the sprocs.  With LINQ, however, you can still restrict direct access  to tables and instead put ACLs on updatable table &lt;em&gt;views&lt;/em&gt; to achieve a similar end (assuming your database supports updatable views).  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manageability&lt;/strong&gt;: Using views also gives you the advantage of shielding your application non-breaking from schema changes (like table normalization).  You can update the view without requiring your data access code to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to be a big sproc guy, but I'm starting to lean towards LINQ as a better alternative in general.  If there are some areas where sprocs are clearly better, then I'll probably still write a sproc but access it using LINQ. :)&lt;/p&gt;

The goal of MapReduce is to be able to use efficiently a load of processing units working in parallels for some kind of algorithms. The exemple is the following: you want to extract all the words and their count in a set of documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typical implementation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for each document
    for each word in the document
  get the counter associated to the word for the document
     increment that counter 
    end for
end for
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MapReduce implementation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Map phase (input: document key, document)
for each word in the document
    emit an event with the word as the key and the value "1"
end for

Reduce phase (input: key (a word), an iterator going through the emitted values)
for each value in the iterator
    sum up the value in a counter
end for
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around that, you'll have a master program which will partition the set of documents in "splits" which will be handled in parallel for the Map phase. The emitted values are written by the worker in a buffer specific to the worker. The master program then delegates other workers to perform the Reduce phase as soon as it is notified that the buffer is ready to be handled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every worker output (being a Map or a Reduce worker) is in fact a file stored on the distributed file system (GFS for Google) or in the distributed database for CouchDB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java's heap is divided into different generations, each of which is collected using a different strategy. If you attach a profiler to a healthy app, you'll see that it very rarely has to run the most expensive kinds of collections because most objects are caught by the faster copying collector in the young generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling System.gc() directly, while technically not guaranteed to do anything, in practice will trigger an expensive, stop-the-world full heap collection. This is &lt;em&gt;almost always the wrong thing to do&lt;/em&gt;. You think you're saving resources, but you're actually wasting them for no good reason, forcing Java to recheck all your live objects just in case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are having problems with GC pauses during critical moments, you're better off configuring the JVM to use the concurrent mark/sweep collector, which was designed specifically to minimise time spent paused, than trying to take a sledgehammer to the problem and just breaking it further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sun document you were thinking of is here: &lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/hotspot/gc/gc_tuning_6.html"&gt;Java SE 6 HotSpot&amp;trade; Virtual Machine Garbage Collection Tuning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Another thing you might not know: implementing a finalize() method on your object makes garbage collection slower. Firstly, it will take &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; GC runs to collect the object: one to run finalize() and the next to ensure that the object wasn't resurrected during finalization. Secondly, objects with finalize() methods have to be treated as special cases by the GC because they have to be collected individually, they can't just be thrown away in bulk.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the only built in object in VBScript is the WScript object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;WScript.Echo "Hello, World!"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the docs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The WScript object is the root object of the Windows Script Host
  object model hierarchy. It never needs to be instantiated before invoking its
  properties and methods, and it is always available from any script file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything else must be created via the CreateObject call.  Some of those objects are &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f51wc7hz(VS.85).aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;listed here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shell object is one of the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; objects that you need to create if you want to call methods on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One caveat, is that RegExp is &lt;em&gt;sort of&lt;/em&gt; built in, in that you can instantiate a RegExp object like so in VBScript:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Dim r as New RegExp
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/"&gt;MySQL&lt;/a&gt; + writing custom DB code in C++ or Python or whatever seems like a rather heavy-handed solution.  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Schnapple&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bruceatk kind of hit on what I'm thinking of; it's not so much the DB engine as I want the other niceties that Access brings to the party.  The nice form designer, the nice reporting engine etc.  But you do raise a very good point about the installation footprint.  I had considered that but I've not made any firm decisions about which way I'm going with this yet anyway.  It'll probably be something fairly lightweight anyway and a small installation footprint would definitely be a plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Remou,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No I was unaware that the MS Access 2007 runtime is free; thanks for pointing that out.  The last time I'd bothered to investigate it (I don't remember when it was) I think it was a fairly expensive license for the runtime because I think they were trying to sell it to Corporate IT departments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thanks to everyone else who responded as well; I was completely unaware of those other options you all pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thought: while the original question does ask about desktop databases, its likely some people will land here looking for a database to use with a web site.  It's important to remember that these are all &lt;em&gt;in-process&lt;/em&gt; databases, and as such are rarely if ever appropriate for use on the web.  If you want to build a web site, you really need a database &lt;em&gt;server&lt;/em&gt; engine, like MS SQL, MySQL, Oracle, or their brethren.  At the same time, those &lt;em&gt;server&lt;/em&gt; engines are rarely if ever appropriate for a single-user desktop application.&lt;/p&gt;

I found the community around CouchDB to be both very knowledgable and helpful so that whenever I ran into an issue it was resolved in a matter of minutes or hours at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just kicked off a project the other week which basically requires us to store data in the non-relational way and due to CouchDB's document oriented store we selected it as one of the technologies to use. So this is actually the first time that I will run it in production, but I'm still pretty confident about it. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just an update here (2009-10-25):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first CouchDB install is 20 GB, it hosts 40 million records. It's been running in production since January 2009, and it's been great. Read (&lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt;) speed is outstanding and we use it as a store for complex data, and then it's just pull.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our second couchdb installment has two databases, one is 160,000,000+ documents (210 GB), and growing between 150,000-300,000 documents a day. The other is &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; 35,000,000 documents (7 GB). This setup has a lot more reads and writes and initial tests are performing very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;View building on the 160,000,000 document database took roughly a week, but since then we upgraded to a larger Amazon EC2 instance and we are also getting ready to update to CouchDB &lt;code&gt;0.10.x&lt;/code&gt; (from &lt;code&gt;0.9.1&lt;/code&gt;) as this release includes a lot of performance improvements in view building.&lt;/p&gt;

The relevant definition is found in section 11.1.4 and unfortunately is not very clear. The section explicitly states that elisions (= omissions) at the beginning or in the middle don't define an element &lt;em&gt;but do contribute to the overall length&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no explicit statements about redundant commas at the end of the initializer but by omission I conclude that the above statement implies that they do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; contribute to the overall length so I conclude that &lt;strong&gt;MSIE is wrong&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relevant paragraph reads as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Array elements may be elided at the beginning, middle or end of the element list. Whenever a comma in the element list is not preceded by an Assignment Expression (i.e., a comma at the beginning or after another comma), the missing array element contributes to the length of the Array and increases the index of subsequent elements. Elided array elements are not defined. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of Stack Overflow, the cookies are automatically provided as part of the XmlHttpRequest request.  I don't know the implementation details of the Stack Overflow authentication provider, but that cookie data is probably automatically used to verify your identity at a lower level than the "vote" controller method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More generally, cookies are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; required for AJAX.  XmlHttpRequest support (or even iframe remoting, on older browsers) is all that is technically required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you want to provide security for AJAX enabled functionality, then the same rules apply as with traditional sites.  You need some method for identifying the user behind each request, and cookies are almost always the means to that end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In your example, I cannot write to your document.cookie, but I can still steal your cookie and post it to my domain using the XMLHttpRequest object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;XmlHttpRequest won't make cross-domain requests (for exactly the sorts of reasons you're touching on).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could normally inject script to send the cookie to your domain using iframe remoting or JSONP, but then HTTP-Only protects the cookie again since it's inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you had compromised StackOverflow.com on the server side, you wouldn't be able to steal my cookie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Edit 2: Question 2. If the purpose of Http-Only is to prevent JavaScript access to cookies, and you can still retrieve the cookies via JavaScript through the XmlHttpRequest Object, what is the point of Http-Only?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider this scenario:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I find an avenue to inject JavaScript code into the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeff loads the page and my malicious JavaScript modifies his cookie to match mine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeff submits a stellar answer to your question.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because he submits it with my cookie data instead of his, the answer will become mine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You vote up "my" stellar answer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My real account gets the point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With HTTP-Only cookies, the second step would be impossible, thereby defeating my XSS attempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Edit 4: Sorry, I meant that you could send the XMLHttpRequest to the StackOverflow domain, and then save the result of getAllResponseHeaders() to a string, regex out the cookie, and then post that to an external domain. It appears that Wikipedia and ha.ckers concur with me on this one, but I would love be re-educated...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's correct.  You can still session hijack that way.  It does significantly thin the herd of people who can successfully execute even that XSS hack against you though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you go back to my example scenario, you can see where HTTP-Only &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; successfully cut off the XSS attacks which rely on modifying the client's cookies (not uncommon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It boils down to the fact that a) no single improvement will solve &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; vulnerabilities and b) no system will &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; be completely secure.  HTTP-Only &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; a useful tool in shoring up against XSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, even though the cross domain restriction on XmlHttpRequest isn't 100% successful in preventing all XSS exploits, you'd still never dream of removing the restriction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, I try and get a feel for the business model my customer/client is trying to emulate with the application they want built. Are we building a glorified forms processor? Are we retrieving data from multiple sources in a single application to save time? Are we performing some kind of integration?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the general businesss model is established, I then move to the "must" and "must nots" for the application to dictate what data I can retrieve, who can perform what functions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually if you can get the customer to explain their model or workflow, you can move from there and find additional key questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one question I always make sure to ask in some form or another is "What is the trickiest/most annoying thing you have to do when doing X. Typically the answer to that reveals the craziest business/data rule you'll have to implement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser" rel="nofollow"&gt;recursive descent parser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get precedence you need to think recursively, for example, using your sample string, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1+11*5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to do this manually, you would have to read the &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, then see the plus and start a whole new recursive parse "session" starting with &lt;code&gt;11&lt;/code&gt;... and make sure to parse the &lt;code&gt;11 * 5&lt;/code&gt; into its own factor, yielding a parse tree with &lt;code&gt;1 + (11 * 5)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all feels so painful even to attempt to explain, especially with the added powerlessness of C. See, after parsing the 11, if the * was actually a + instead, you would have to abandon the attempt at making a term and instead parse the &lt;code&gt;11&lt;/code&gt; itself as a factor. My head is already exploding. It's possible with the recursive decent strategy, but there is a better way...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The easy (right) way&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use a GPL tool like Bison, you probably don't need to worry about licensing issues since the C code generated by bison is not covered by the GPL (IANAL but I'm pretty sure GPL tools don't force the GPL on generated code/binaries; for example Apple compiles code like say, Aperture with GCC and they sell it without having to GPL said code).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bison" rel="nofollow"&gt;Download Bison&lt;/a&gt; (or something equivalent, ANTLR, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is usually some sample code that you can just run bison on and get your desired C code that demonstrates this four function calculator:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/html_mono/bison.html#Infix-Calc" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/html_mono/bison.html#Infix-Calc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at the generated code, and see that this is not as easy as it sounds. Also, the advantages of using a tool like Bison are 1) you learn something (especially if you read the Dragon book and learn about grammars), 2) you avoid &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Invented_Here" rel="nofollow"&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt; trying to reinvent the wheel. With a real parser-generator tool, you actually have a hope at scaling up later, showing other people you know that parsers are the domain of parsing tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People here have offered much sound advice. My only warning against skipping the parsing tools or just using the Shunting Yard algorithm or a hand rolled recursive decent parser is that little toy languages&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://docs.garagegames.com/tgea/official/content/documentation/Scripting%20Reference/Introduction/TorqueScript.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; may someday turn into big actual languages with functions (sin, cos, log) and variables, conditions and for loops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flex/Bison may very well be overkill for a small, simple interpreter, but a one off parser+evaluator may cause trouble down the line when changes need to be made or features need to be added. Your situation will vary and you will need to use your judgement; just don't &lt;a href="http://docs.garagegames.com/tgea/official/content/documentation/Scripting%20Reference/Introduction/TorqueScript.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;punish other people for your sins&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; and build a less than adequate tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My favorite tool for parsing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best tool in the world for the job is the &lt;a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/using-parsec.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Parsec&lt;/a&gt; library (for recursive decent parsers) which comes with the programming language Haskell. It looks a lot like BNF, or like some specialized tool or domain specific language for parsing (sample code [3]), but it is in fact just a regular library in Haskell, meaning that it compiles in the same build step as the rest of your Haskell code, and you can write arbitrary Haskell code and call that within your parser, and you can mix and match other libraries &lt;em&gt;all in the same code&lt;/em&gt;. (Embedding a parsing language like this in a language other than Haskell results in loads of syntactic cruft, by the way. I did this in C# and it works quite well but it is not so pretty and succinct.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://docs.garagegames.com/tgea/official/content/documentation/Scripting%20Reference/Introduction/TorqueScript.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; Richard Stallman says, in &lt;a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~trent/gnu/tcl-not" rel="nofollow"&gt;Why you should not use Tcl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The principal lesson of Emacs is that
  a language for extensions should not
  be a mere "extension language".  It
  should be a real programming language,
  designed for writing and maintaining
  substantial programs. Because people
  will want to do that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[2] Yes, I am forever scarred from using that "language".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also note that when I submitted this entry, the preview was correct, but &lt;strong&gt;SO's less than adequate parser ate my close anchor tag on the first paragraph&lt;/strong&gt;, proving that parsers are not something to be trifled with because if you use regexes and one off hacks &lt;strong&gt;you will probably get something subtle and small wrong&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to help the garbage collector, null off references to objects you no longer need. Less path to follow= more explicitly garbage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't forget that (non-static) inner class instances keep references to their parent class instance. So an inner class thread keeps a lot more baggage than you might expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a very related vein, if you're using serialization, and you've serialized temporary objects, you're going to need to clear the serialization caches, by calling ObjectOutputStream.reset()  or your process will leak memory and eventually die.
Downside is that non-transient objects are going to get re-serialized.
Serializing temporary result objects can be a bit more messy than you might think!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider using soft references. If you don't know what soft references are, have a read of the javadoc for java.lang.ref.SoftReference&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steer clear of Phantom references and Weak references unless you really get excitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside a Match you can define groups, either anonymous or named, to make it easier to split up a match. A simple example is to create a regex to search for URLs, and then use groups inside to find the protocol (http), domain (www.web.com), path (/lol/cats.html) and arguments and what not. &lt;/p&gt;

sys.stderr.write(s.getvalue())

Of course, it worked fine when testing with VStudio.NET 2005, because the user running the app has elevated privileges.  However, running it on IIS I get a "Access to the registry key 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software' is denied.", which suggests the IIS user doesn't have read access to that part of the registry (I only do reads through the website itself, never writes).&lt;/p&gt;

In contrast, single checkout prevents that little bit of extra work but it does so at the cost of huge inefficiencies in scheduling. Typically it takes a short amount of time to merge two changes to the same file (e.g. minutes), whereas it takes a significant amount of time to make changes to a file (e.g. many hours or days) so that preventing access to editing a file is a huge inefficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pointers/References&lt;/strong&gt; to ensure that this == this and this != that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classes&lt;/strong&gt; to point to (e.g. Arm) that store data (int hairyness) and operations (Throw(IThrowable))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polymorphism (Inheritance and/or Interfaces)&lt;/strong&gt; to treat specific objects in a generic fashion so you can read books as well as graffiti on the wall (both implement IReadable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encapsulation&lt;/strong&gt; because an apple doesn't expose an Atoms[] property&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Requirements are a set of well written documents that protect both the client and yourself. Never forget that. If no requirement is present then it was not paid for (and thus it requires a formal change request), if it's present then it &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be implemented and must work correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Requirements must be testable. If a requirement cannot be tested then it isn't a requirement. That means something like, "The system "&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Requirements must be concrete. That means stating "The system user interface shall be easy to use" is not a correct requirment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to actually "gather" the requirements you need to first make sure you understand the businness model. The client will tell you what they want with its own words, it is your job to understand it and interpret it in the right context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make meetings with the client while you're developing the requirements. Describe them to the client with your own words and make sure you and the client have the same concept in the requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Requirements require concise, testable example, but keep track of every other thing that comes up in the meetings, diagrams, doubts and try to mantain a record of every meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If you don't declare your own constructor in the subclass, trying to instantiate it will throw a fatal error, because it tries to call the superclass constructor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the case of a DB connection, when you're presumably returning (in PHP, anyway) a mysqli instance or the resource returned by the &lt;code&gt;mysql_connect()&lt;/code&gt; function (or some other link to some other RDBMS), as long as you mark the instance private, there's no threat of somebody subclassing it and tampering with the link.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As I alluded to before, if somebody really wants to override your behavior and make multiple connections, they could just as well do it by writing a new class.&lt;/li&gt;

Perforce supports merging, and in fact had better merge support than SVN until SVN 1.5 where named merges were added (as well as change lists, which Perforce has always had and I mis very much moving to a shop that used SVN, but we won't upgrade until 1.5 has been a bit more time tested.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that SVN and Perforce both allow you to do a locked checkout, so you can do the "unmerged" model if you want, but aside perhaps from managing binaries with version control, I don't see much use for this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Requirements gathering is incredibly tough because of the manner in which communication works. Its a four step process that is lossy in each step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have an idea in my head&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I transform this into words and pictures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You interpret the pictures and words&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You paint an image in your own mind of what my original idea was like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And humans fail miserably at this with worrying frequency through their adorable imperfections. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agile does right in promoting iterative development. Getting early versions out to the client is important in identifying what features are most important (what ships in 0.1 - 0.5 ish), helps to keep you both on the right track in terms of how the application will work and quickly identifies the hidden features that you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two main problem scenarios are the two ends of the scales:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not having a freaking clue about what you are doing&lt;/strong&gt; - get some domain experts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having too many requirements&lt;/strong&gt; - feature pit. - Question, cull (prioritise ;) ) features and use iterative development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yegge does well in pointing out that domain experts are essential to produce good requirements because they know the business and have worked in it. They can help identify the core desire of the client and will help explain how their staff will use the system and what is important to the staff. 
Alternatives and additions include trying to do the job yourself to get into the mindset or having a client staff member occasionally on-site, although the latter is unlikely to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feature pit is the other side, mostly full of failed government IT projects. Too much, too soon, not enough thought or application of realism (but what do you expect they have only about four years to make themselves feel important?). The aim here is to work out what the customer &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wants.
As long as you work on getting the core components correct, efficient and bug-free clients usually remain tolerant of missing features that arrive in later shipments, as long as they eventually arrive. This is where iterative development really helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember to separate the client's ideas of what the program will be like and what they want the program to &lt;em&gt;achieve&lt;/em&gt;.
Some clients can create confusion by communicating their requirements in the form of application features which may be poorly thought out or made redundant by much simpler functionality then they think they require. While I'm not advocating calling the client an idiot or not listening to them I feel that it is worth forever asking &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they want a particular feature to get to its underlying purpose. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that in either scenario it is of imperative importantance to root out the quickest path to fulfilling the customers &lt;em&gt;core&lt;/em&gt; need and put you in a scenario where you are both profiting from the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

This is similar to the behavior under Microsoft TFS and VSS.  Subversion on the other hand does not set read-only attributes.  IMO, the Subversion method is easier because you don't have to bother with a source control client in order to modify files -- you go ahead and modify with reckless abandon and then compare what has changed on disk with the server when you are ready to check in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When all files are read-only, I find myself constantly changing a file, attempting to save, discovering it is read-only, then having to hop over to the source control client to check it out.  Its not so bad if the source control client is integrated into your editor, but if you are storing things that are not source code under version control this often isn't an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, Object-Orientation is all about objects that collaborate by sending messages. That is, to me, the single most important trait of an object-oriented language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to put up an ordered list of all the features that an object-oriented language must have, it would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://C2.com/cgi/wiki?MessagePassing"&gt;Objects sending messages to other objects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything is an Object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://C2.Com/cgi/wiki?LateBinding"&gt;Late Binding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://C2.Com/cgi/wiki?PolyMorphism"&gt;Subtype Polymorphism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inheritance or something similarly expressive, like &lt;a href="http://C2.Com/cgi/wiki?DelegationInheritance"&gt;Delegation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://C2.com/cgi/wiki?EncapsulationDefinition"&gt;Encapsulation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://C2.com/cgi/wiki?InformationHiding"&gt;Information Hiding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abstraction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this list is very controversial, since it excludes a great variety of languages that are widely regarded as object-oriented, such as &lt;a href="http://Java.Com/"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://MSDN.Microsoft.Com/vcsharp/"&gt;C#&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://Open-Std.Org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/"&gt;C++&lt;/a&gt;, all of which violate points 1, 2 and 3. However, there is no doubt that those languages allow for object-oriented programming (but so does &lt;a href="http://Open-Std.Org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/"&gt;C&lt;/a&gt;) and even facilitate it (which C doesn't). So, I have come to call languages that satisfy those requirements "purely object-oriented".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As archetypical object-oriented languages I would name &lt;a href="http://Research.Sun.Com/self/"&gt;Self&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://NewspeakLanguage.Org/"&gt;Newspeak&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both satisfy the above-mentioned requirements. Both are inspired by and successors to &lt;a href="http://Smalltalk.Org/"&gt;Smalltalk&lt;/a&gt;, and both actually manage to be "more OO" in some sense. The things that I like about Self and Newspeak are that both take the message sending paradigm to the extreme (Newspeak even more so than Self).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Newspeak, &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; is a message send. There are no instance variables, no fields, no attributes, no constants, no class names. They are all emulated by using getters and setters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Self, there are &lt;em&gt;no classes&lt;/em&gt;, only objects. This emphasizes, what OO is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; about: objects, not classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We make use of a .DLL that gets the Hardware ID of the computer. It's usage is very simple and the sample program I have created works. The Dll is &lt;a href="http://www.azsdk.com/hardwareid.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;This from AzSdk&lt;/a&gt;. 
In fact, this works perfectly under Windows XP. However, for some strange reason, inside our project (way bigger), we get this exception: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Exception Type:        System.DllNotFoundException
Exception Message:     Unable to load DLL 'HardwareID.dll': Invalid access to memory location. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x800703E6)
Exception Target Site: GetHardwareID
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know what can be causing the problem, since I have full control over the folder. The project is a c#.net Windows Forms application and everything works fine, except the call for the external library. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am declaring it like this: (note: it's &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a COM library and it doesn't need to be registered).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[DllImport("HardwareID.dll")]
public static extern String GetHardwareID(bool HDD,
   bool NIC, bool CPU, bool BIOS, string sRegistrationCode);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then the calling code is quite simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    textBox1.Text = GetHardwareID(cb_HDD.Checked, 
                                  cb_NIC.Checked, 
                                  cb_CPU.Checked, 
                                  cb_BIOS.Checked, 
                                 "*Registration Code*");
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you create a sample application, it works, but inside my projectit doesn't. Under XP works fine. Any ideas about what should I do in Vista to make this work? 
As I've said, the folder and its sub-folders have Full Control for "Everybody". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you support that statement? What is your experiment that shows that a large DataContext is a performance bottleneck? Having multiple datacontexts is a lot like having multiple databases and makes sense in similar scenarios, that is, hardly ever. If you are working with multiple datacontexts you need to keep track of which objects belong to which datacontext and you can't relate objects that are not in the same data context. That is a costly design smell for no real benefit. &lt;/p&gt;

That is precisely why you should not have more than one datacontext. Why would you want more that one "unit of work" at a time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm curious though how you wouldn't need to know that the failover happened, because don't you have to then update the datasources in your applications to point to the new server that you failed over to?  Mirroring takes place on different hosts (the primary and the mirror), unlike clustering which has multiple nodes that appear to be a single device from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, are you using a witness server in order to automatically fail over from the primary to the mirror?  This is the only way I know of to make it happen automatically, and in my experience, you get a lot of false-positives where network hiccups can fool the mirror and witness into thinking the primary is down when in fact it is not.&lt;/p&gt;

I have done some of my own design work for both web sites and desktop applications, and though I have not used source control in the past, I am in the process of implementing SVN for my own use as I am starting to do some paid freelance work.  I intend to utilize version/source control precisely the way I would with source code.  It just becomes another folder in the project trunk.  The way I have worked without source control is to create an &lt;em&gt;assets&lt;/em&gt; folder in which all media files that are equivalents of source code reside.  I like to think of Photoshop PSD's as &lt;em&gt;graphics source code&lt;/em&gt; while the JPEG output for a web site or otherwise is the &lt;em&gt;compiled version&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of working with designers, which is a distinct possibility I face in the near future, I'd like to make an attempt to have them "check-in" their different versions of their source files on a regular basis.  I'll be curious to read what others with some experience will say in response to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds like an excellent idea to me. Every time a page loads I want to know what sql statements are executed and also a count of the total number of DB round trips. 
Does anyone have a neat solution to this problem? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think is an acceptable number of queries? I was thinking that during development I might have my application throw an exception if more than 30 queries are required to render a page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I think I must not have explained my question clearly. During a HTTP request a web application might execute a dozen or more sql statements. I want to have those statements appended to the bottom of the page, along with a count of the number of statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HERE IS MY SOLUTION:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a TextWriter class that the DataContext can write to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;public class Logger : StreamWriter
    {
        public string Buffer { get; private set; }
        public int QueryCounter { get; private set; }&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    public Logger() : base(new MemoryStream())
    {}

    public override void Write(string value)
    {
        Buffer += value + "&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;";
        if (!value.StartsWith("--")) QueryCounter++;
    }

    public override void WriteLine(string value)
    {
        Buffer += value + "&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;";
        if (!value.StartsWith("--")) QueryCounter++;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the DataContext's constructor I setup the logger:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public HeraldDBDataContext()
        : base(ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["Herald"].ConnectionString, mappingSource)
    {
        Log = new Logger();
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I use the Application_OnEndRequest event to add the results to the bottom of the page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;protected void Application_OnEndRequest(Object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        Logger logger = DataContextFactory.Context.Log as Logger;
        Response.Write("Query count : " + logger.QueryCounter);
        Response.Write("&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;");
        Response.Write(logger.Buffer);
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned 64 bit, because at low levels structs from 32 bit to 64 bit do not get properly handled.  Since the machines aren't 64bit, then more than likely disabling DEP would be a good logical next step.  Vista did get more secure than XP SP2.&lt;/p&gt;

That is, the row data is physically organized by the clustered index's key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That makes one ideal for a heavily-accessed column that has a reasonably small number of possible values (compared to the total number of rows), where most queries want to retrieve all rows with a particular value. Because all such rows are physically stored together, disk I/O, particularly seek time, is reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Reasonably small" is not easily defined, but postal or zip codes in an address table seems reasonable if you're often querying for all addresses in a single code's region. Province/state/territory codes are likely too small a selection for a country-wide address table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you don't want to use them on columns with few possible values (e.g., M/F for gender) because then the clustering doesn't buy you anything and likely costs you for insertions. You also never want to use clustering on "autonumber" surrogate key columns (from sequences in Oracle) because that will create a "hot spot" in the last extent of the table as all insertions must physically happen there. You also don't want to apply clustering to a column value that will be updated because the RDBMS will have to physically move the record to maintain the clustered ordering.&lt;/p&gt;

Amongst the capabilities of the CRM provider is for developers to author business logic in a  Java like language and on events such as the user clicking a button or submitting a new account into the system, have validation and/or business logic fire off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the capabilities that we make use of is for that business code running on the hosted provider to invoke web services that we host.  The canonical example is a sales rep entering  in a new sales lead and hitting a button to ping our systems to see if we can identify that new lead based on email address, company/first/last name, etc, and if so, return back an internal GUID that represents that individual.  This all works for us fine, but we've run into a wall again and again in trying to setup a sane dev environment to work against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while our use case is a bit nuanced, this can generally apply to any development house that builds APIs for 3rd party consumption:  &lt;b&gt;what are some best practices when designing a development pipeline and environment when  you're building APIs to be consumed by the outside world?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At our office, all our devs are behind a firewall, so code in progress can't be hit by the outside world, in our case the CRM provider.  We could poke holes in the firewall but that's less than ideal from a security surface area standpoint.  Especially if the # of devs who need to be in a DMZ like area is high.  We currently are trying a single dev machine in the DMZ and then remoting into it as needed to do dev work, but that's created a resource scarcity issue if multiple devs need the box, let alone they're making potentially conflicting changes (e.g.  different branches).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've considered just mocking/faking incoming requests by building fake clients for these services, but that's a pretty major overhead in building out feature sets  (though it does by nature reinforce a testability of our APIs).  This also doesn't obviate the fact that sometimes we really do need to diagnose/debug issues coming from the real client itself, not some faked request payload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't give the network service or aspnet accounts access to the network share. I could possibly use impersonation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The network share and the web application are both hosted on the same domain and I can create a new user on the domain specifically for this purpose however I'm not quite sure how to join the dots between creating the filestream and specifying the credentials to use in the web application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the drive isn't mapped as a network drive on the machine, it's only available to me as a network share so unfortunately I can't make a transparent call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one problem I can think of with impersonation... I can only impersonate one user per application domain I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; but I'm happy to be corrected. I may need to write this file to several different shares which means I may have to impersonate several users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of creating a token... if I can do that I'll be able to ask the use up front for their credentials and then dynamically apply the security and give them meaningful error messages if access is denied... I'm off to play but I'll be back with an update.&lt;/p&gt;

Are you saying that only you have perms to the share or that you manually mapped it to a drive letter.  If the later you can use ucn \host\share the same way you would use a c:\shared_folder.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Random
Would it be a burden to mirror the share to a local folder on the host?  I hear ROBOCOPY is pretty handy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another Idea.  Run IIS on your target share you can read via http and if you need to write investigate webdav.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn't matter that they are introducing namespaces if all the standard libraries still require you to prefix all your function calls with stuff like mysql_ and pgsql_, when in a language that supported namespaces in the actual API, you could get rid of functions with mysql_ and have just a simple "include system.db.mysql.*" at the top of your file so that it would know where those things came from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;N            - Total number of bits to shift
F = (N / 8) - Full 8 bit integers shifted
R = (N % 8) - Remaining bits that need to be shifted
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess from here you would have to find the most optimal way to make use of this data to move around ints in an array.  Generic algorithms would be to apply the full integer shifts by starting from the right of the array and moving each integer &lt;code&gt;F&lt;/code&gt; indexes.  Zero fill the newly empty spaces.  Then finally perform an &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; bit shift on all of the indexes, again starting from the right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of shifting &lt;code&gt;0xBC&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; bits you can calculate the overflow by doing a bitwise AND, and the shift using the bitshift operator:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// 0xAB shifted 4 bits is:
(0xAB &amp;amp; 0x0F) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 4   // is the overflow      (0x0A)
0xAB &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 4            // is the shifted value (0xB0)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that the 4 bits is just a simple mask: 0x0F or just 0b00001111.  This is easy to calculate, dynamically build, or you can even use a simple static lookup table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that is generic enough.  I'm not good with C/C++ at all so maybe someone can clean up my syntax or be more specific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonus:  If you're crafty with your C you might be able to fudge multiple array indexes into a single 16, 32, or even 64 bit integer and perform the shifts.  But that is prabably not very portable and I would recommend against this.  Just a possible optimization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can assume your array is a multiple of 4 you can cast the array into an array of uint64_t and then work on that.  If it isn't a multiple of 4, you can work in 64-bit chunks on as much as you can and work on the remainder one by one.
This may be a bit more coding, but I think it's more elegant in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can try to find your commit by looking through the output of &lt;code&gt;git fsck --lost-found&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newer versions of Git have something called the "reflog", which is a log of all changes that are made to the refs (as opposed to changes that are made to the repository contents). So, for example, every time you switch your HEAD (i.e. every time you do a &lt;code&gt;git checkout&lt;/code&gt; to switch branches) that will be logged. And, of course, your &lt;code&gt;git reset&lt;/code&gt; also manipulated the HEAD, so it was also logged. You can access older states of your refs in a similar way that you can access older states of your repository, by using an &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; sign instead of a &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;, like &lt;code&gt;git reset HEAD@{1}&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to understand what the difference is between HEAD@{1} and HEAD~1, so here is a little explanation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git init
git commit --allow-empty -mOne
git commit --allow-empty -mTwo
git checkout -b anotherbranch
git commit --allow-empty -mThree
git checkout master # This changes the HEAD, but not the repository contents
git show HEAD~1 # =&amp;gt; One
git show HEAD@{1} # =&amp;gt; Three
git reflog
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;code&gt;HEAD~1&lt;/code&gt; means "go to the commit before the commit that HEAD currently points at", while &lt;code&gt;HEAD@{1}&lt;/code&gt; means "go to the commit that HEAD pointed at before it pointed at where it currently points at".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That will easily allow you to find your lost commit and recover it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your source-code is not worth stealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this comes as a shock to the ego, but I can say this confidently without ever having seen a line of code you've written because outside the very few realms of development where serious magic happens, it's true of all source-code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say, tomorrow, someone dumped a pile of DVDs on your doorstep containing the source code for Windows Vista. What would you be able to do with it? Sure, you could compile it and give away copies, but that's just one step more effort than copying the retail version. You could painstakingly find and remove the license-checking code, but that's something some bright kid has already done to the binaries. Replace the logo and graphics, pretend you wrote it yourself and market it as "Vicrosoft Mista"? You'll get caught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could spend an enormous amount of time reading the code, trying to understand it and truly "stealing the intellectual property" that Microsoft invested in developing the product. But you'd be disappointed. You'd find the code was a long series of mundane decisions, made one after the other. Some would be smarter than you could think of. Some would leave you shaking your head wondering what kind of monkeys they're hiring over there. Most would just make you shrug and say "yeah, that's how you do that."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the process you'll learn a lot about writing operating systems, but that's not going to hurt Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace "Vista" with "Leopard" and the above paragraphs don't change one bit. It's not Microsoft, it's &lt;em&gt;software&lt;/em&gt;. Half the people on this site could probably develop a Stack Overflow clone, with or without looking at the source of this site. They just haven't. The source-code of Firefox and WebKit are out there for anyone to read. Now go write your own browser from scratch. See you in a few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software development is an investment of time. It's utter hubris to imagine that what you're doing is so special that nobody could clone it without looking at your source, or even that it would make their job that much easier without an actionable (and easily detectable) amount of cut and paste. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I have the same issue with people interrupting my coding with questions and requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we have been using for a little while is "do not disturb" signs on our desks, which can be flipped when "in the zone", and flipped back when you don't mind being disturbed (as much). They mostly work for us, when people obey the signs of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing I do is to encourage people to email me instead of phoning or face to facing - so I can respond later at my convenience (but I try to get back reasonably quickly).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This code works by looking ahead 12 bits for each byte and copying the proper bits forward. 12 bits is the bottom half (nybble) of the next byte and the top half of 2 bytes away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;unsigned char length = 10;
unsigned char data[10] = {0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0A,0xBC};

while (shift &amp;lt; data+(length-2)) {
    *shift = (*(shift+1)&amp;amp;0x0F)&amp;lt;&amp;lt;4 | (*(shift+2)&amp;amp;0xF0)&amp;gt;&amp;gt;4;
    shift++;
}
*(data+length-2) = (*(data+length-1)&amp;amp;0x0F)&amp;lt;&amp;lt;4;
*(data+length-1) = 0x00;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Justin wrote:&lt;br /&gt;
  @Mike, your solution works, but does not carry.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I'd say a normal shift operation does just that (called overflow), and just lets the extra bits fall off the right or left. It's simple enough to carry if you wanted to - just save the 12 bits before you start to shift. Maybe you want a circular shift, to put the overflowed bits back at the bottom? Maybe you want to realloc the array and make it larger? Return the overflow to the caller? Return a boolean if non-zero data was overflowed? You'd have to define what carry means to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;unsigned char overflow[2];
*overflow = (*data&amp;amp;0xF0)&amp;gt;&amp;gt;4;
*(overflow+1) = (*data&amp;amp;0x0F)&amp;lt;&amp;lt;4 | (*(data+1)&amp;amp;0xF0)&amp;gt;&amp;gt;4;
while (shift &amp;lt; data+(length-2)) {
    /* normal shifting */
}  
/* now would be the time to copy it back if you want to carry it somewhere */
*(data+length-2) = (*(data+length-1)&amp;amp;0x0F)&amp;lt;&amp;lt;4 | (*(overflow)&amp;amp;0x0F);
*(data+length-1) = *(overflow+1);  

/* You could return a 16-bit carry int, 
 * but endian-ness makes that look weird 
 * if you care about the physical layout */
unsigned short carry = *(overflow+1)&amp;lt;&amp;lt;8 | *overflow;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Trivia is OK, but you'll have to write each of them :-(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Someone&lt;/em&gt; would have to write them.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could do trivia questions in the same way ReCaptcha does printed words.  It offers two words, one of which it knows the answer to, another which it doesn't - after enough answers on the second, it now knows the answer to that too.  Ask two trivia questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A woman needs a man like a fish needs a?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orange orange orange. Type green.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this may need to be coupled with other techniques, such as timers or computed secrets.  Questions would need to be rotated/retired, so to keep the supply of questions up you could ad-hoc add:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter your obvious question:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't even need an answer; other humans will figure that out for you.  You may have to allow flagging questions as "too hard", like this one: "asdf ejflf asl;jf ei;fil;asfas".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, to slow someone who's running a StackOverflow gaming bot, you'd rotate the questions by IP address - so the same IP address doesn't get the same question until &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the questions are exhausted.  This slows building a dictionary of known questions, forcing the human owner of the bots to answer all of your trivia questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I approached the problem by&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;drawing the memory cells and drawing arrows from the destination to the source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;made a table showing the above drawing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;labeling each row in the table with the relative byte address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This showed me the pattern:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;let iL be the low nybble (half byte) of a[i]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;let iH be the high nybble of a[i]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iH = (i+1)L&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iL = (i+2)H&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pattern holds for all bytes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Translating into C, this means:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a[i] = (iH &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 4) OR iL
a[i] = ((a[i+1] &amp;amp; 0x0f) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 4) | ((a[i+2] &amp;amp; 0xf0) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 4)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now make three more observations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;since we carry out the assignments left to right, we don't need to store any values in temporary variables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we will have a special case for the tail: all 12 bits at the end will be zero.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we must avoid reading undefined memory past the array.  since we never read more than a[i+2], this only affects the last two bytes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we
- handle the general case by looping for N-2 bytes and performing the general calculation above
- handle the next to last byte by it by setting iH = (i+1)L
- handle the last byte by setting it to 0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;given a with length N, we get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; N - 2; ++i) {
    a[i] = ((a[i+1] &amp;amp; 0x0f) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 4) | ((a[i+2] &amp;amp; 0xf0) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 4);
}
a[N-2] = (a[N-1) &amp;amp; 0x0f) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 4;
a[N-1] = 0;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there you have it... the array is shifted left by 12 bits.  It could easily be generalized to shifting N bits, noting that there will be M assignment statements where M = number of bits modulo 8, I believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The loop could be made more efficient on some machines by translating to pointers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (p = a, p2=a+N-2; p != p2; ++p) {
    *p = ((*(p+1) &amp;amp; 0x0f) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 4) | (((*(p+2) &amp;amp; 0xf0) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 4);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and by using the largest integer data type supported by the CPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I've just typed this in, so now would be a good time for somebody to review the code, especially since bit twiddling is notoriously easy to get wrong.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most character encoding problems happen when strings are being passed from one system to another. For webapps, this is usually between the browser and the application, between the application and the filesystem and between the application and the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you need to check where the mis-encoded data is coming from, what character encoding it has at the source, and what encoding it is being received as. The best way is to send through characters you know the system is having problems with, and examine them at each level of the app. What do they look like inside the app? In the database? When you get them back from the database? When they're displayed in the browser?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stream format for Java serialization is defined &lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/pdf/serial-spec.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;in this document&lt;/a&gt;, but you need access to the original class definitions (and a Java runtime to load them into) to turn the stream data back into something approaching the original objects. For example, classes may define writeObject() and readObject() methods to customise their own serialized form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;edit:&lt;/strong&gt; lubos hasko suggests having a little java program to deserialize the objects in front of Python, but the problem is that for this to work, your "little java program" needs to load the same versions of all the same classes that it might deserialize.

Either way, it's not going to be a little program any more. &lt;strong&gt;edit2:&lt;/strong&gt; I could be wrong here, I don't know what gets serialized. If it's just log4j classes you should be fine. On the other hand, it's possible to log arbitrary exceptions, and if they get put in the stream as well my point stands.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be much easier to customise the log4j network adapter and replace the raw serialization with some more easily-deserialized form (for example you could use XStream to turn the object into an XML representation)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can't you just simply reference Java log4j libraries in your own java process? I'm just giving general advice here that is applicable to any pair of languages (name of the question is pretty language agnostic so I just provided one of the generic solutions). Anyway, I'm not familiar with log4j and don't know whether you can "inject" your own serializer into it. If you can, then of course your suggestion is much better and cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the input array might be empty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the last and next-to-last bits need to be treated specially, because they have zero bits shifted into them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a simple solution which loops over the array copying the low-order nibble of the next byte into its high-order nibble, and the high-order nibble of the next-next (+2) byte into its low-order nibble. To save dereferencing the look-ahead pointer twice, it maintains a two-element buffer with the "last" and "next" bytes: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void shl12(uint8_t *v, size_t length) {
  if (length == 0) {
    return; // nothing to do
  }

  if (length &amp;gt; 1) {
    uint8_t last_byte, next_byte;
    next_byte = *(v + 1);

    for (size_t i = 0; i + 2 &amp;lt; length; i++, v++) {
      last_byte = next_byte;
      next_byte = *(v + 2);
      *v = ((last_byte &amp;amp; 0x0f) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 4) | (((next_byte) &amp;amp; 0xf0) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 4);
    }

    // the next-to-last byte is half-empty
    *(v++) = (next_byte &amp;amp; 0x0f) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 4;
  }

  // the last byte is always empty
  *v = 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the boundary cases, which activate successively more parts of the function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; is zero, we bail out without touching memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; is one, we set the one and only element to zero.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; is two, we set the high-order nibble of the first byte to low-order nibble of the second byte (that is, bits 12-16), and the second byte to zero. We don't activate the loop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; is greater than two we hit the loop, shuffling the bytes across the two-element buffer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If efficiency is your goal, the answer probably depends largely on your machine's architecture. Typically you should maintain the two-element buffer, but handle a machine word (32/64 bit unsigned integer) at a time. If you're shifting a lot of data it will be worthwhile treating the first few bytes as a special case so that you can get your machine word pointers word-aligned. Most CPUs access memory more efficiently if the accesses fall on machine word boundaries. Of course, the trailing bytes have to be handled specially too so you don't touch memory past the end of the array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to this conversation, you can't just use distutils. It doesn't follow the debian packaging format (or something like that). I guess that's why you need dh_make as seen in the Ubuntu Packaging guide&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

The Java Serialization, like pretty much everything in Javaland, is standardized. So, you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; implement a deserializer according to that standard in Python. However, the Java Serialization format is not designed for cross-language use, the serialization format is closely tied to the way objects are represented inside the JVM. While implementing a JVM in Python is surely a fun exercise, it's probably not what you're looking for (-:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other (data) serialization formats that are specifically designed to be language agnostic. They usually work by stripping the data formats down to the bare minimum (number, string, sequence, dictionary and that's it) and thus requiring a bit of work on both ends to represent a rich object as a graph of dumb data structures (and vice versa).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two examples are &lt;a href="http://JSON.Org/" rel="nofollow" title="JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)"&gt;JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://YAML.Org/" rel="nofollow" title="YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)"&gt;YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ASN1.Elibel.Tm.Fr/en/" rel="nofollow" title="ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One)"&gt;ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One)&lt;/a&gt; is another data serialization format. Instead of dumbing the format down to a point where it can be easily understood, ASN.1 is self-describing, meaning all the information needed to decode a stream is encoded within the stream itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, of course, &lt;a href="http://W3.Org/XML/" rel="nofollow" title="XML (eXtensible Markup Language)"&gt;XML (eXtensible Markup Language)&lt;/a&gt;, will work too, provided that it is not just used to provide textual representation of a "memory dump" of a Java object, but an actual abstract, language-agnostic encoding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to make a long story short: your best bet is to either try to coerce log4j into logging in one of the above-mentioned formats, replace log4j with something that does that or try to somehow intercept the objects before they are sent over the wire and convert them before leaving Javaland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libraries that implement JSON, YAML, ASN.1 and XML are available for both Java and Python (and pretty much every programming language known to man).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise the situation is a bit more grim. As for Rapid prototype, you might want to check the CodeGear (Borland/C++ Builder) tools. I think their VCL library is cross-platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, you could interface with a scripting language like Ruby and use fantastic front end libraries like Shoes. Python also interfaces with &lt;a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;wxWidgets&lt;/a&gt; to make writing cross-platform front ends easy. Keep in mind that this all requires taking time to make sure your C/C++ code can talk to the scripting language. This is not trivial, and the amount of effort required depends upon the style of your code base. (Oh my God.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, you could just use wxWidgets itself. This might be your best bet since it requires no additional overhead than coding the UI itself. That said, C++ is not the greatest language for designing UIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And super lastly, consider writing a code generator that converts from say Shoes to whatever wxWidgets code is needed to generate the same Shoes app. That way you can do easier UI design but still get C++ code in the end. Likewise, you could code gen off of the Python/wxWidgets code. Then sell such a code generator. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would want you to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell me why I would want to use Scripting (in general) as opposed to Java-- what does it let me do quicker (as in development time), what does it make more readable. Give tantalising examples of ways I can use chunks of scripting in my mostly Java app. You want to make this relevant to Java devs moreso than tech-junkies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With that out of the way, why Groovy? Why not Ruby, Python or whatever (which are all runnable on the JVM).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't show me syntax that Java can already do (if statements, loops etc) or if you do make it quick. It's as boring as hell to watch someone walk through language syntax 101 for 20min.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For syntax that has a comparible feature in Java maybe show them side by side quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For syntax that is not in Java (closures etc) you can talk to them in a bit more detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember those examples from the first point. Show me one, fully working (or at least looking like it is).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the end have question time. That is &lt;strong&gt;crazy&lt;/strong&gt; important, and with that comes a burden on you to be a psuedo-guru :P.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure about how the Java6 scripting support works but I'm fairly sure it can be made secure. I remember something about defining the API the script can use before it's run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is the case then an example you could show would be some thick-client application (e.g. a music player) where users can write their own scripts with an API you provide them in Groovy which allows them to script their app in interesting and secure ways (e.g. creating custom columns in the playlist)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However if you do not have that option (or some similar ORM tool), I don't see any reason to separate Read/Write methods. It just adds more classes and complicates data access. I have always designed it as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Component/Business Object: Car&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Access, containing static Read and Write methods: CarDB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example Usage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Car car = new Car();
car.Manufacturer = "Toyota"
car.Model = "Camry"
car.Year = 2006;
car.CarID = CarDB.InsertCar(car)
car.OwnerID = 2;
CarDB.UpdateCar(car);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also makes sense for data access where both Reads and Write need to be performed as part of the same transaction. If you split up the classes, where would that go?&lt;/p&gt;

Like generating tests from classes was one I remember from a year or so back.. that defeats the whole point of &lt;em&gt;test-driving&lt;/em&gt; - your design is supposed to emerge from tiny steps of RGR: writing a test-make it pass-refactor. If you use that tool - it robs you of the entire experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll stop with my sermon.. now :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Hypothesis&lt;/strong&gt;: Maybe you have a main thread and a timer thread accessing this control. The main thread shuts down - calling Control.Dispose() to indicate that I'm done with this Control and I shall make no more calls to this. However the timer thread is still active - a context switch to that thread, where it may call methods on the same control. Now the control says I'm Disposed (already given up my resources) and I shall not work anymore. ObjectDisposed exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to solve this&lt;/strong&gt;: In the timer thread, before calling methods/properties on the control, do a check with &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if ControlObject.IsDisposed then return; // or do whatever - but don't call control methods
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of the logging is to a DB since admin users for the products we build need to be able to view them in their nice little app with all the bells and whistles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We log all of our diagnostics and debug info to file. We have no need for really "prettifying" it and TBH, we don't even often need it, so we just log and archive for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say if the user is doing anything with it, then log to DB, if its for you, then a file will probably suffice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of the sort of relationship is that I have a table of OrderLines. Orderlines have a foreign key relationship to Products and Products in turn have a foreign key relationship to ProductTypes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd like to have a databound DataGridView where each row represents an orderline, displaying the line's product and producttype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users can add or edit orderlines direct to the grid and choose the product for the order line from a comboBoxColumn - this should then update the producttype column, showing the producttype for the selected product, in the same row.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closest to a good fit that I've found so far is to introduce a domain object representing an orderline then bind the DataGridView to a collection of these orderlines. I then add properties to the orderline object that expose the product and the producttype, and raise relevant notifypropertychanged events to keep everything up to date. In my orderline repository I can then wire up the mappings between this orderline object and the three tables in my database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works for the databinding side of things, but having to hand code all that OR-mapping in the repository seems bad. I thought nHibernate would be able to help with this wiring up but am struggling with the mappings through all the foreign keys - they seem to work ok (the foreignkey lookup for an orderline's product creates the correct product object based on the foreign key) until I try to do the databinding, I can't get the databound id columns to update my product or producttype objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is my general approach even in the right ballpark? If it is, what is a good solution to the mapping problem?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, is there a better solution to databinding rows including foreign key lookups that I haven't even considered?&lt;/p&gt;

Another alternative is the &lt;a href="http://www.linuxmanpages.com/man3/tmpfile.3.php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;tmpfile(3)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; function.
Which one of them you choose depends on whether you want the file to be opened as a C library file stream (which &lt;code&gt;tmpfile&lt;/code&gt; does), or a direct file descriptor (&lt;code&gt;mkstemp&lt;/code&gt;). The &lt;code&gt;tmpfile&lt;/code&gt; function also deletes the file automatically when you program finishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantage of using these functions is that they avoid race conditions between determining the unique filename and creating the file -- so that two programs won't try to create the same file at the same time, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I'm starting to think it can't be done that way since there doesn't seem to be a way to maintain the offset counter between calls. Is that right, or is there something I'm missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You aren't missing anything; SQL Server does not support global variables, and it doesn't support data modification within UDFs.  And even if you wanted to do something as kludgy as using CONTEXT_INFO (see &lt;a href="http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/mladenp/archive/2007/04/23/60185.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/mladenp/archive/2007/04/23/60185.aspx&lt;/a&gt;), you can't set that from within a UDF anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

An example of something I deem worthy of database-ifying is data generation - assume our customer has a FirstName and a LastName. Now, the user interface needs a DisplayName, which is derived from some nontrivial logic. For this generation, I create a stored procedure which is then executed by a trigger whenever the row (or other source data) is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Javascript code which does the authentication via XmlHttpRequest looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function Login() {
   var request = GetRequest(); // retrieves XmlHttpRequest
   request.onreadystatechange = function() {
      if (this.status == 401) {     // unauthorized request -&amp;gt; invalid credentials

   }
   request.open("GET", "http://myServer", false, "domain\\username", "password");
   request.send(null);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't want the NTLM dialog box to be displayed when the user provides invalid credentials. Instead the postback by the login button in the authentication form should be executed. In other words, the browser should not find out about my unauthorized request.&lt;/p&gt;

From the website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Log parser is a powerful, versatile
  tool that provides universal query
  access to text-based data such as log
  files, XML files and CSV files, as
  well as key data sources on the
  Windows operating system such as the
  Event Log, the Registry, the file
  system, and Active Directory.  You
  tell Log Parser what information you
  need and how you want it processed.
  The results of your query can be
  custom-formatted in text based output,
  or they can be persisted to more
  specialty targets like SQL, SYSLOG, or
  a chart.  Most software is designed to
  accomplish a limited number of
  specific tasks. Log Parser is
  different... the number of ways it can
  be used is limited only by the needs
  and imagination of the user.  The
  world is your database with Log
  Parser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven't used the program myself, but it seems quite interesting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have looked at it again this morning - using the &lt;code&gt;MATCH&lt;/code&gt; function for the lookup works in an array formula. But then the &lt;code&gt;INDEX&lt;/code&gt; function does not. I have also tried using it with &lt;code&gt;OFFSET&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;INDIRECT&lt;/code&gt; without success. Finally, the &lt;code&gt;CHOOSE&lt;/code&gt; function does not seem to accept a cell range as its list to choose from - the range degrades to a single value (the first cell in the range). It should also be noted that the &lt;code&gt;CHOOSE&lt;/code&gt; function only accepts 30 values to choose from (according to the documentation). All very annoying. However, I do now have a working solution in one cell: using the &lt;code&gt;CHOOSE&lt;/code&gt; function and explicitly listing the result cells one by one in the arguments like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;=ARRAYFORMULA(SUM(CHOOSE(MATCH(D1:D8,Lookups!$A$1:$A$3,0),

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously this doesn't extend very well but hopefully the lookup tables are by nature quite fixed. For larger lookup tables it's a pain to type all the cells individually and some people may exceed the limit of 30 cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would certainly welcome a more elegant solution!&lt;/p&gt;

It's very easy and works quite well. One thing that annoys me to no end is the use of HTML redirects instead of HTTP. I changed that manually, based on some information gotten in the &lt;a href="https://www.siege.org/forum/viewforum.php?id=8"&gt;phpMyID forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I have switched to &lt;a href="https://www.myopenid.com/"&gt;myOpenId&lt;/a&gt; in the meantime. Rolling an own provider is fun and games but &lt;em&gt;it just isn't secure&lt;/em&gt;! There are two issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More generally, you have to act on faith. phpMyID is great but it's developed in someone's spare time. There could be many undetected security holes in it and there have been some, in the past. While this of course applies to all security-related software, I believe the problem is potentially more severe with software developed in spare time, especially since the code is far from perfect in my humble opinion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, OpenID is highly susceptible to screen scraping and mock interfaces. It's just too easy for an attacker to emulate the phpMyID interface to obtain your credentials for another site. myOpenId offers two very important solutions to the problem.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first is its use of a cookie-stored picture that is embedded in the login page. If anyone screen-scapes the myOpenId login page, this picture will be missing and the fake can easily be identified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, myOpenId supports sign-in using strongly signed certificates that can be installed in the web browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have phpMyID set up as an alternative provider using &lt;a href="http://yadis.org/wiki/Main_Page"&gt;Yadis&lt;/a&gt; but I wouldn't use it as a login on sites that I don't trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, read Sam Ruby's &lt;a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2007/01/03/OpenID-for-non-SuperUsers"&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep MySQL's auto_increment as unsigned integer fields (of various sizes) in order to make use of the full range, as I know there will never be negative values. MS SQL does not support the unsigned attribute on all integer types, so I have to choose between ditching half the value range or creating some workaround.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One very naive approach would be to put some code in the database abstraction code or in a stored procedure that converts between negative values on the db side and values from the larger portion of the unsigned range. This would mess up sorting of course, and also it would not work with the auto-id feature (or would it some way?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't think of a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; workaround right now, is there any? Or am I just being fanatic and should simply forget about half the range?&lt;/p&gt;

@Mike Woodhouse: Yeah, I guess you're right. There's still a voice in my head saying that maybe I could reduce the field's size if I optimize its utilization. But if there's no easy way to do this, it's probably not worth worrying about it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally GUIDs don't make good primary keys as they are large and inserts can happen at potentially any data page within the table rather than at the last data page.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM PEOPLE WHERE SURNAME='O''Keefe'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it's probably incorrect to do this yourself. Your language may have a function to escape strings for use in SQL, but an even better option is to use parameters. Usually this works as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your SQL command would be : &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM PEOPLE WHERE SURNAME=?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, when you execute it, you pass in "O'Keefe" as a parameter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the SQL is parsed before the parameter value is set, there's no way for the parameter value to alter the structure of the SQL (and it's even a little faster if you want to run the same statement several times with different parameters).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should also point out that, while your example just causes an error, you open youself up to a lot of other problems by not escaping strings appropriately.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lighttpd (Lighty)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mod_wsgi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I understand, mod_wsgi is a newer alternative. It appears to be faster and easier on resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mod_fastcgi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using FastCGI you are delegating the serving of Django to another process. Since mod_python includes a python interpreter in every request it uses a lot of memory. This is a way to bypass that problem. Also there is some security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you do is that you start your Django FastCGI server in a separate process and then configures apache via rewrites to call this process when needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serve Django &lt;strong&gt;without using Apache&lt;/strong&gt; but with another server that supports FastCGI natively:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The documentation mentions that you can do this if you don't have any Apache specific needs. I guess the reason must be to save memory.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lighttpd&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the server that runs Youtube. It seems fast and easy to use, however i've seen reports on memoryleaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nginx&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've seen benchmarks claiming that this server is even faster than lighttpd. It's mostly documented in Russian though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing, due to limitations in Python your server should be running in forked mode, not threaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is my current research, but I want more opinions and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side, consider also the experience and background of developers, operators, platform administrators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also think on what constraints you have regarding programming languages, operating systems, memory footprint, network bandwidth, hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least, you have to think about business issues like budget for licences, support, operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all those considerations you should end up with just a couple of options and the selection should be easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, select the technology that suits the best the constraints and needs of your organization and project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I certainly think that you are right on saying that it is not an obvious choice given the wide number of alternatives, but this is the only way I think you can narrow them to the ones that are really feasible for your project.&lt;/p&gt;

I am developing a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Struts" rel="nofollow"&gt;Struts&lt;/a&gt; web application which runs in a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Tomcat" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tomcat&lt;/a&gt; server. This is the environment I set up to work with UTF-8:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have added the attributes &lt;code&gt;URIEncoding="UTF-8" useBodyEncodingForURI="true"&lt;/code&gt; into the &lt;code&gt;Connector&lt;/code&gt; tag to Tomcat's &lt;code&gt;conf/server.xml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a &lt;code&gt;utf-8_general_ci&lt;/code&gt; database&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am using the next filter to ensure my request and responses are encoded in UTF-8&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;package filters;

import java.io.IOException;
import javax.servlet.*;

public class UTF8Filter implements Filter {
    public void destroy() {}

    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request,ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
        throws IOException, ServletException {
        request.setCharacterEncoding("UTF-8");
        response.setContentType("text/html;charset=UTF-8");
        chain.doFilter(request, response);
    }

    public void init(FilterConfig filterConfig) throws ServletException {
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I use this filter in WEB-INF/web.xml&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am using the next code for my JSON responses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public static void populateWithJSON(HttpServletResponse response,JSONObject json)
{
   String CONTENT_TYPE="text/x-json;charset=UTF-8";
   response.setContentType(CONTENT_TYPE);
   response.setHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache");
   try {
        response.getWriter().write(json.toString());
   } catch (IOException e) {
    throw new ApplicationException("Application Exception raised in RetrievedStories", e);
   }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything seems to work fine (content coming from the database is displayed properly, and I am able to submit forms which are stored in UTF-8 in the database). The problem is that I am &lt;strong&gt;not able to submit forms with Ajax&lt;/strong&gt;. I use jQuery, and I thought the problem was the lack of contentType field in the Ajax request. But I was wrong. I have a really simple form to submit comments which contains of an id and a body. The body field can be in different languages such as Spanish, German, or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I submit my form with body textarea containing &lt;code&gt;contrasea&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firebug_%28software%29" rel="nofollow"&gt;Firebug&lt;/a&gt; shows me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;Request Headers&lt;/h3&gt;
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  localhost:8080&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accept-Charset&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; ISO-8859-1, utf-8;q=0.7;*q=0.7&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content-Type&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset UTF-8&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I execute &lt;em&gt;Copy Location with parameters&lt;/em&gt; in Firebug, the encoding seems already wrong:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://localhost:8080/Cerepedia/corporate/postStoryComment.do?&amp;amp;body=contrase%C3%B1a&amp;amp;id=88
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my jQuery code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function addComment() {
    var comment_body = $("#postCommentForm textarea").val();
    var item_id = $("#postCommentForm input:hidden").val();
    var url = rooturl+"corporate/postStoryComment.do?";
    $.post(url, { id:  item_id, body: comment_body } ,
        function(data){
        /* Do stuff with the answer */
    }, "json");  }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A submission of a form with jQuery is causing the next error server side (note I am using &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernate_%28Java%29" rel="nofollow"&gt;Hibernate&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

We have a program running in the background that needs to run per-user, and it needs to start automatically without user intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_Policy#Operation" rel="nofollow"&gt;Group Policy Object&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory" rel="nofollow"&gt;Active Directory&lt;/a&gt; (GPO/AD) deployment the application is started in the SYSTEM context before anyone is logged in rather than as the user who is about to log in. The application can only run once per user, and it seems that the SYSTEM process prevents the USER process from starting. This means the PCs need to be rebooted twice before the software can be deployed to the users. How do we to stop this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically the current workflow is: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installation/upgrade runs... kill background application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install new files&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means schema upgrade scripts  are part of any upgrade package for the application and run automatically when the application starts.  In case of errors the application fails to start and the upgrade script transaction is not committed.  The downside to this is that the application has to have full modification access to the schema (this annoys DBAs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've had great success using Hibernates SchemaUpdate feature to manage the table structures. Leaving the upgrade scripts to only handle actual data initialization and occasional removing of columns (SchemaUpdate doesn't do that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding testing, since the upgrades are part of the application, testing them becomes part of the test cycle for the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterthought: Taking on board some of the criticism in other posts here, note the rule says "it's own". It only really applies where the application &lt;em&gt;owns&lt;/em&gt; the schema as is generally the case with software sold as a product. If your software is sharing a database with other software, use other methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software we are currently developing is a pretty big project. It consists of a client environment, an application server, various databases, web services host etc.
The project is developed incrementally and we want to ship the bits in intervals of one to two months. The first deliveries will not be used in production. They have the puropse of a demo to encourage the customers to give feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don't want to put burden on the customers to install and configure the system. All in all we are looking for a way to ease the deployment, installation and configuration pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I thought of was to use a virtualizing technique to preinstall and preconfigure a virtual machine with all components that are neccessary. Our customers just have to mount the virtual image and run the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to hear from folks who use this technique. I suppose there are some difficulties as well. Especially, what about licensing issues with the installed OS?
Perhaps it is possible to have the virtual machine expire after a certain period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any experiences out there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason you were not getting the UAC prompt is because UAC can only change how a process is &lt;strong&gt;started&lt;/strong&gt;, once the process is running it must stay at the same elevation level. The UAC will prompt will happen if:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vista thinks it's an installer (&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa905330.aspx#wvduac_topic3" rel="nofollow"&gt;lots of rules here&lt;/a&gt;, the simplest one is if it's called "setup.exe"), &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it's flagged as "Run as Administrator" (you can edit this by changing the properties of the shortcut or the exe), or &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the exe contains a manifest requesting admin privileges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two options are workarounds for 'legacy' applications that were around before UAC, the correct way to do it for new applications is to &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb756929.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;embed a manifest resource&lt;/a&gt; asking for the privileges that you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some program, such as &lt;a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;Process Explorer&lt;/a&gt; appear to elevate a running process (when you choose "Show details for all process" in the file menu in this case) but what they really do is start a new instance, and it's that new instance that gets elevated - not the one that was originally running. This is the recommend way of doing it if only some parts of your application need elevation (e.g. a special 'admin options' dialog).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since you seem to be fortunate enough to have a choice, I'll take a quick run through the questions and maybe pose a few more at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest criterion may be cost. Do you want/are you prepared to pay for your DBMS platform? If not, then Oracle, MS SQL Server, Sybase and others are probably out, although if you're not building a commercial app then there may be some wiggle room. Also, platform - can you run the software on your hardware?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other dimensions for consideration might include expected number of concurrent connections, transactional vs mostly reads, size, availability and I guess lots of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Special features" are, in the main, to be avoided - in my cynical world-view they're intended to lock you into a platform. So something like Oracle's PL/SQL is a feature that, while powerful (and likely to mean the need for extra CPU power at more licensing cost) is not portable. If you expect extremely high volumes then partitioning may be useful, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have worked with Oracle, MS SQL Server, MySQL, PostreSQL, SQLite and Sybase that I can think of. I'd happily recommend all but Sybase, about which I have some concerns these days (I could easily be wrong, but personally I think the money could be better spent elsewhere) but not all for the same applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, I like to have the warm feeling that it doesn't really matter what DB platform I'm using because I can port easily. With a good abstraction layer between data and business logic, I should be able to develop locally against, say, the excellent SQLite and implement painlessly on, for example, Postgres. With something like ActiveRecord from Rails coupled with a little awareness of things like differences in reserved words, this is almost completely cost-free.&lt;/p&gt;

( There is a high chance this is going to end up a normalised versus denormalised database debate..which I am not going to start... okay now for some input.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;some off the top of my head things I have done (will add more when I have some more time or need a break)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;client design - this is where the VB method of inline sql (even with prepared statements) gets you into trouble.  You can spend AGES just finding those statements.  If you use something like Hibernate and put as much SQL into named queries you have a single place for most of the sql (nothing worse than trying to test sql that is inside of some IF statement and you just don't hit the "trigger" criteria in your testing for that IF statement).  Prior to using hibernate (or other orms') when I would do SQL directly in JDBC or ODBC  I would put all the sql statements as either public fields of an object (with a naming convention) or in a property file (also with a naming convention for the values say PREP_STMT_xxxx.  And use either reflection or iterate over the values  at startup in a) test cases b) startup of the application (some rdbms allow you to pre-compile with prepared statements before execution, so on startup post login I would pre-compile the prep-stmts at startup to make the application self testing.  Even for 100's of statements on a good rdbms thats only a few seconds. and only once.  And it has saved my butt a lot.  On one project the DBA's wouldn't communicate (a different team, in a different country) and the schema seemed to change NIGHTLY, for no reason.  And each morning we got a list of exactly where it broke the application, on startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need adhoc functionality , put it in a well named class (ie. again a naming convention helps with auto mated testing) that acts as some sort of factory for you query (ie. it builds the query).  You are going to have to write the equivalent code anyway right, just put in a place you can test it.  You can even write some basic test methods on the same object or in a separate class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can , also try to use stored procedures.  They are a bit harder to test as above.  Some db's also don't pre-validate the sql in stored procs against the schema at compile time only at run time. It usually involves say taking a copy of the schema structure (no data) and then creating all stored procs against this copy (in case the db team making the changes DIDn't validate correctly).  Thus the structure can be checked.  but as a point of change management stored procs are great.  On change all get it.  Especially when the db changes are a result of business process changes.  And all languages (java, vb, etc get the change )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually also setup a table I use called system_setting etc.  In this table we keep a VERSION identifier.  This is so that client libraries can connection and validate if they are valid for this version of the schema.  Depending on the changes to your schema, you don't want to allow clients to connect if they can corrupt your schema (ie. you don't have a lot of referential rules in the db, but on the client).  It depends if you are also going to have multiple client versions (which does happen in NON - web apps, ie. they are running the wrong binary).  You could also have batch tools etc.  Another approach which I have also done is define a set of schema to operation versions in some sort of property file or again in a system_info table.  This table is loaded on login, and then used by each "manager" (I usually have some sort of client side api to do most db stuff) to validate for that operation if it is the right version.  Thus most operations can succeed, but you can also fail (throw some exception) on out of date methods and tells you WHY.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;managing the change to schema -&gt; do you update the table or add 1-1 relationships to new tables ?  I have seen a lot of shops which always access data via a view for this reason. This allows table names to change , columns etc.  I have played with the idea of actually treating views like interfaces in COM.  ie. you add a new VIEW for new functionality / versions.  Often, what gets you here is that you can have a lot of reports (especially end user custom reports) that assume table formats.  The views allow you to deploy a new table format but support existing client apps (remember all those pesky adhoc reports).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, need to write update and rollback scripts.  and again TEST, TEST, TEST...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;------------  OKAY - THIS IS A BIT RANDOM DISCUSSION TIME --------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually had a large commercial project (ie. software shop) where we had the same problem.  The architecture was a 2 tier and they were using a product a bit like PHP but pre-php.  Same thing.  different name.  anyway i came in in version 2....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was costing A LOT OF MONEY to do upgrades.  A lot. ie. give away weeks of free consulting time on site.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was getting to the point of wanting to either add new features or optimize the code.  Some of the existing code used stored procedures , so we had common points where we could manage code.  but other areas were this embedded sql markup in html.  Which was great for getting to market quickly but with each interaction of new features the cost at least doubled to test and maintain.   So when we were looking at pulling out the php type code out, putting in data layers (this was 2001-2002, pre any ORM's etc) and adding a lot of new features (customer feedback) looked at this issue of how to engineer UPGRADES into the system.  Which is a big deal, as upgrades cost a lot of money to do correctly.  Now, most patterns and all the other stuff people discuss with a degree of energy deals with OO code that is running, but what about the fact that your data has to a) integrate to this logic, b) the meaning and also the structure of the data can change over time, and often due to the way data works you end up with a lot of sub process / applications in your clients organisation that needs that data -&gt; ad hoc reporting or any complex custom reporting, as well as batch jobs that have been done for custom data feeds etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind i started playing with something a bit left of field.  It also has a few assumptions.  a) data is heavily read more than write.  b) updates do happen, but not at bank levels ie. one or 2 a second say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea was to apply a COM / Interface view to how data was accessed by clients over a set of CONCRETE tables (which varied with schema changes).  You could create a seperate view for each type operation - update, delete, insert and read.  This is important.  The views would either map directly to a table , or allow you to trigger of a dummy table that does the real updates or inserts etc.  What i actually wanted was some sort of trappable level indirection that could still be used by crystal reports etc. NOTE -  For inserts , update and deletes you could also use stored procs.  And you had a version for each version of the product.  That way your version 1.0 had its version of the schema, and if the tables changed, you would still have the version 1.0 VIEWS but with NEW backend logic to map to the new tables as needed, but you also had version 2.0 views that would support new fields etc.  This was really just to support ad hoc reporting, which if your a BUSINESS person and not a coder is probably the whole point of why you have the product.

&lt;p&gt;The simplest way is to configure your network card with a static IP and NO GATEWAY, the only gateway (ie. internet access) your laptop will find is then via the mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disadvantage of this method is that you'll need to access your TFS server by IP address (or netbios name) as all DNS requests will be going out over the internet and not through your private LAN. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: If you can't use the phone when the LAN is plugged in, that's because you've got it setup for DHCP and the DHCP server is advertising (incorrectly for you) that it will accept and route internet traffic. As previously mentioned, setup with a static IP and no gateway... if you insist on using DHCP you'll need to learn the ROUTE command in DOS, find the IP address of your phone (assuming it's acting as a router) set that as the default route, and remove whatever default route was assigned from the DHCP server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT2: @dan - you can't use the internet from your phone directly (eg. mobile browser), or you can't make your laptop use your phone for internet when the cable is plugged in? (ie. routing issues) ... if it's the former, then your phone is probably configuring a PAN with your phone and trying to route internet back over the LAN&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT @Jorge - IP routing is the responsibility of the network layer, not the application.  Go review the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model" rel="nofollow"&gt;OSI model&lt;/a&gt; ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft have licensing schemes for this type of situation, since it's only been used for demonstration purposes and not production use a TechNet subscription might just cover you. Give your local Microsoft licensing centre a call to discuss, unlike the offshore support teams they're really helpful and friendly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For running the 'stack' with the least overhead for your clients, I suggest using VMware. The customers can download the free VMware player, load up the machines (or multiple machines) and get a feel for the system... Microsoft Virtual PC or Virtual Server is  going to be a bit more intrusive and not quite the "plug n play" solution that you're looking for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're only looking to ship the application, consider either thinstall or providing Citrix / Terminal services access - customers can remotely login to your own (test) machines and run what they need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally if it's doable, a standalone system would be best - tell your customers install vmware player, then run this app... which launches the various parts of your application stack (maybe off of a DVD) and you've got a fully self contained demo for the marketing guys to pimp out :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, you asked about C++.  Not C.  Not frigging  &lt;em&gt;macros&lt;/em&gt;.  C++.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C++ has proper strings.  Not C's stupid NTBS nonsense.  Proper strings.  Use them!  They're in the standard header string.  #include &amp;lt;string&amp;gt; to use them. No more strcat/strcpy buffer overruns; no more missing null terminators; no more messy manual memory management; proper counted strings with proper value semantics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C++ has the ability to convert bools into human-readable representations too.  We saw hints at it earlier with the iostream examples, but they're a bit limited because they can only blast the text to the console (or with fstreams, a file).  Fortunately, the designers of C++ weren't complete idiots; we also have iostreams that are backed not by the console or a file, but by an automatically managed string buffer.  They're called stringstreams.  #include &amp;lt;sstream&amp;gt; to get them. Then we can say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;std::string bool_as_text(bool b)
{
    std::stringstream converter;
    converter &amp;lt;&amp;lt; b;
    return converter.str();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we don't really want to type all that.  Fortunately, C++ also has a convenient third-party library named &lt;a href="http://www.boost.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Boost&lt;/a&gt; that can help us out here.  Boost has a nice function called lexical_cast.  We can use it thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;boost::lexical_cast&amp;lt;std::string&amp;gt;(my_bool)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it's true to say that this is higher overhead than some macro; stringstreams deal with locales which you might not care about, and create a dynamic string (with memory allocation) whereas the macro can yield a literal string, which avoids that.  But on the flip side, the stringstream method can be used for a great many conversions between printable and internal representations. You can run 'em backwards; boost::lexical_cast&amp;lt;bool&amp;gt;("true") does the right thing, for example.  You can use them with numbers and in fact any type with the right formatted I/O operators.  So they're quite versatile and useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if after all this your profiling and benchmarking reveals that the lexical_casts are an unacceptable bottleneck, &lt;em&gt;that's&lt;/em&gt; when you should consider doing some macro horror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would think a better option would be to make it so that your logging system trapped duplicates, so that it could write something like, "The previous message was repeated N times".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assume I've written a standard note about how you should open your connection at the last possible moment and close it at the earliest opportunity, rather than spanning a potentially huge function in the way you've done it (but perhaps that is an artefact of your demonstrative code and your application is actually written properly).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you say that it's reporting the error you describe, do you mean that &lt;em&gt;this handler&lt;/em&gt; is reporting the error? The reason it's not clear to me is that in the code snippet you say "Something went wrong", but you didn't say that in your description; I wouldn't want this to be something so silly as the exception is being caught somewhere else, and the code is getting stuck somewhere other than the sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

Mercurial, as far as I understand, use a special protocol (wire) and Bazaar needs and addition of python extensions. Is there another system which is easier to integrate with IIS?

&lt;p&gt;The question is, "What is the ip address from the receiver adapter?" not the address from the sender which we get in the &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for open betas, that depends on your audience, really. Counterstrike, for example, apparently run a few closed betas before doing open betas, so here's my suggestion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up a forum in some free forumboard, or set up a topic in a popular gaming forum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for people (whether or not they are in those forums) that you trust, and let them in in a closed beta. This will allow you to iron out serious kinks at first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your closed group isn't reporting as much bugs any more, release it to open beta, pointing out ways on how they could give feedback to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is similar to the approach StackOverflow took, but this being a game setting it up on a gaming forum will give the dual benefit of advertising your game &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; getting some interested beta testers.&lt;/p&gt;

If this is the case, I think you might get more loyalty and commitment from users in a closed beta.&lt;/p&gt;

How you test/launch depends mostly on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What your application &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who your users &lt;strong&gt;are&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you application is a technical application and is geared to the technically-minded, the word "beta" won't really scare them - but provide an opportunity to test the product before it goes 'live', and help to improve the system.  This is the ideal circumstance in which to use either an open or closed beta.  It's usually beneficial to start off 'closed' with a group of people you select and trust to bug-find quickly and reliably - after you're more confident that all the critical bugs are gone, open it up with an invite system (for example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, however, your application is 'trivial' from a technical standpoint (i.e. it's something like Twitter, or Facebook, or Flickr - nothing that is inherently geared towards technical usage), then you're going to have to be more careful in how you plan your testing.  Closed testing is most definitely your first port of call, and this should last for longer than a closed beta on a more 'technical' product.  The reason?  Your 'average Joe' doesn't necessarily know what the word "beta" means, and others may well be scared by it, or judge your service prematurely (not understanding the concept of this 'public testing' phase).  Many won't want to be used as guinea pigs.&lt;/p&gt;

Alternatively, perhaps a new Logging mechanism has been implemented or a new log Appender that writes to stdout, and thus is being re-logged by Weblogic. I would look at the configuration of your logger. (Or provide it with one, if it is using a default config)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, when using Hibernate with an active Log4J setup, Hibernate will automatically join in with the Log4J instance that you set up in your own application&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be tuned, as per the normal Log4J config. This example uses the properties configuration style:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;log4j.category.org.hibernate=WARN
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hibernate may join in with other logging mechanisms via the apache commons logging API. Look at how to configure your own logger and tune out the org.hibernate.* frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;n.b. When debugging, switching back on&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;log4j.category.org.hibernate.SQL=INFO or DEBUG
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;can be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assume that you've done your bind using INADDR_ANY to specify the address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is the case, then the semantics of INADDR_ANY is such that a UDP socket is created on the port specified on all of your interfaces. The socket is going to get all packets sent to all interfaces on the port specified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When sending using this socket, the lowest numbered interface is used. The outgoing sender's address field is set to the IP address of that first outgoing interface used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First outgoing interface is defined as the sequence when you do an ifconfig -a. It will probably be eth0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cheers,

As he mentions the DCT transforms the data into the frequency domain. The DCT is heavily used in video compression as the human visual system is must less sensitive to high frequency changes, therefore zeroing out the higher frequency values results in a smaller file, with little effect on a human's perception of the video quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of using the DCT to compare images, I guess the only real benefit is if you cut away the higher frequency data and therefore have a smaller set of data to search/match. Something like Harr wavelets may give better image matching results.&lt;/p&gt;

Bazaar was easy to start off, with simple commands (not like the 140 commands that git has)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantages that we see is the ability to create local branches and work on it without disturbing the main version. Also being able to work without network access, doing diffs is faster. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One command in bzr which I like is the shelve extension. If you start working on two logically different pieces of code in a single file and want to commit only one piece, you can use the shelve extension to literally shelve the other changes later. In Git you can do the same with playing around in the index(staging area) but bzr has a better UI for it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the people were reluctant to move over as they have to type in two commands to commit and push (bzr ci + bzr push). Also it was difficult for them to understand the concept of branches and merging (no one uses branches or merges them in svn).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you understand that, it will increase the developer's productivity. Till everyone understands that, there will be inconsistent behaviour among everyone. &lt;/p&gt;

To find the pixel-co-ordinates, you'll need to extend this further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to remember is that the cursor can be in three states&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a regular insertion cursor at a specific position&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a text selection that has a certain bounded area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not active: textarea does not have focus. Has not been used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IE model uses the Object document.selection, from this we can get a TextRange object which gives us access to the selection and thus the cursor position(s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FF model/Opera uses the handy variables [input].selectionStart and selectionEnd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both models represent a regular ative cursor as a zero-width selection, with the left bound being the cursor position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the input field does not have focus, you may find that neither is set.
I have had good success with the following code to insert a piece of text at the current cursor location, also replacing the current selection, if present.
Depending on the exact browser, YMMV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function insertAtCursor(myField, myValue) {

/* selecion model - ie */
if (document.selection) {
  myField.focus();
  sel = document.selection.createRange();
  sel.text = myValue;
}

/* field.selectionstart/end  firefox */ 
else if (myField.selectionStart || myField.selectionStart == '0' ) {

  var startPos = myField.selectionStart;
  var endPos = myField.selectionEnd;
  myField.value = myField.value.substring(0, startPos)
    + myValue
    + myField.value.substring(endPos, myField.value.length);

  myField.selectionStart = startPos + myValue.length;
  myField.selectionEnd = startPos + myValue.length;
  myField.focus();
} 

// cursor not active/present
else {
  myField.value += myValue;
}

One, you can let the system manage the memory for you. Alternatively, you can do that by yourself. Generally, you would want to stick to the former as long as possible. However, auto-managed memory in C is extremely limited and you will need to manually manage the memory in many cases, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. You want the variable to outlive the functions, and you don't want to have global variable. ex:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
struct pair{
   int val;
   struct pair *next;
}

struct pair* new_pair(int val){
   struct pair* np = malloc(sizeof(struct pair));
   np-&gt;val = val;
   np-&gt;next = NULL;
   return np;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. you want to have dynamically allocated memory. Most common example is array without fixed length:&lt;/p&gt;


int *my_special_array;
my_special_array = malloc(sizeof(int) * number_of_element);
for(i=0; i

&lt;p&gt;c. You want to do something REALLY dirty. For example, I would want a struct to represent many kind of data and I don't like union (union looks soooo messy):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
struct data{
  int data_type;
  long data_in_mem;
};

struct animal{/*something*/};
struct person{/*some other thing*/};

struct animal* read_animal();
struct person* read_person();

/*In main*/
struct data sample;
sampe.data_type = input_type;
switch(input_type){
 case DATA_PERSON:
   sample.data_in_mem = read_person();
   break;
 case DATA_ANIMAL:
   sample.data_in_mem = read_animal();
 default:
   printf("Oh hoh! I warn you, that again and I will seg fault your OS");
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, a long value is enough to hold ANYTHING. Just remember to free it, or you WILL regret. This is among my favorite tricks to have fun in C :D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, generally, you would want to stay away from your favorite tricks (T___T). You WILL break your OS, sooner or later, if you use them too often. As long as you don't use *alloc and free, it is safe to say that you are still virgin, and that the code still looks nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Expect.Call(reader.Read()).Return(true);
Expect.Call(reader["foo_id"]).Return((long) 1);
// ....
Expect.Call(reader.Read()).Return(true);
Expect.Call(reader["foo_id"]).Return((long) 2);

&lt;p&gt;But really, save yourself some headaches and use a parser instead.  CPAN has several modules that are suitable.  Here's an example using the &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/HTML-Parser/lib/HTML/TokeParser.pm"&gt;HTML::TokeParser&lt;/a&gt; module that comes with the extremely capable &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/HTML-Parser"&gt;HTML::Parser&lt;/a&gt; CPAN distribution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;use strict;

use HTML::TokeParser;

my $parser = HTML::TokeParser-&amp;gt;new('/some/file.html')
  or die "Could not open /some/file.html - $!";

while(my $t = $parser-&amp;gt;get_token)
{
  # Skip start or end tags that are not "p" tags
  next  if(($t-&amp;gt;[0] eq 'S' || $t-&amp;gt;[0] eq 'E') &amp;amp;&amp;amp; lc $t-&amp;gt;[1] ne 'p');

  # Print everything else normally (see HTML::TokeParser docs for explanation)
  if($t-&amp;gt;[0] eq 'T')
  {
    print $t-&amp;gt;[1];
  }
  else
  {
    print $t-&amp;gt;[-1];
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/HTML-Parser"&gt;HTML::Parser&lt;/a&gt; accepts input in the form of a file name, an open file handle, or a string.  Wrapping the above code in a library and making the destination configurable (i.e., not just &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt;ing as in the above) is not hard.  The result will be much more reliable, maintainable, and possibly also faster (HTML::Parser uses a C-based backend) than trying to use regular expressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If sending the email is assumed to be of benefit to the end user, another option would be to have the user enter their own SMTP server (and username / password if required) - On Unix systems, you can possibly just use sendmail and rely on the user to have it configured correctly. I used to work on a system which used this approach to send the user reports of the system's scheduled tasks, and that worked quite well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this a question how video container types are structured?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See for example : &lt;a href="http://www.daubnet.com/formats/AVI.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.daubnet.com/formats/AVI.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is a description how avi files are structured. Google may help you in finding other container file formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you record a video, it is normally composed of individual frames, think of individual bitmap files in a directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To only have 1 file of a video, this stream of frames is put in a container, which has a header describing the contents and a certain layout in which the frames are stored sequentially in the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple example for my own container :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
   struct header
   {
      unsigned int frametype;
      unsigned int framesize;
   };

   byte*  readFrame( header* pHdr, int frameNum )
   {
       byte* pFirstFrame = ((byte*) pHdr) + sizeof( header );
       return pFristFrame + frameNum * pHdr-&amp;gt;framesize;
   }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several other container types. AVI is only one of these container types.
To get to the individual frames you must interpret the header in the file and then based on that information calculate the position of the frame you want to parse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I posted you a link to the definition of the avi file format. There are other places where you can get information on the mpeg/mkv/ogm file formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need this information to get your program to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a side note, compressed formats do not safe all individual frames independently. They safe an individual frame and then several intermediate frames, which only contain the information on how the current frame differs from the last complete frame. So you cannot extract complete frames at every frame number.&lt;/p&gt;
