&lt;p&gt;A common thing that trips people up when marshalling strings in native arrays is that native arrays often use a fixed-size buffer for the string that is allocated inline with the struct.  Your definition is marshalling the strings as a pointer to another block of memory containing the string (which is the default).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.ByValTStr, SizeConst = ##)] might be what you are looking for...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That way they've had the opportunity to give feedback first, and will respect it more when returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common barrier (in my experience, anyway) is some developers always think that their code is somehow inviolate. The irony is that, while often really good code, theirs is often that which needs peer review the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't want to just dump a bunch of code in the question so I've posted the code for the class on refactormycode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.refactormycode.com/codes/461-base-class-for-easy-class-property-handling" rel="nofollow"&gt;base class for easy class property handling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thought was that people can either post code snippets here or make changes on refactormycode and post links back to their refactorings.  I'll make upvotes and accept an answer (assuming there's a clear "winner") based on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At any rate, on to the class itself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see a lot of debate about getter/setter class methods and is it better to just access simple property variables directly or should every class have explicit get/set methods defined, blah blah blah.  I like the idea of having explicit methods in case you have to add more logic later.  Then you don't have to modify any code that uses the class.  However I hate having a million functions that look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public function getFirstName()
{
   return $this-&amp;gt;firstName;
}
public function setFirstName($firstName)
{
   return $this-&amp;gt;firstName;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I'm sure I'm not the first person to do this (I'm hoping that there's a better way of doing it that someone can suggest to me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, the PropertyHandler class has a __call magic method.  Any methods that come through __call that start with "get" or "set" are then routed to functions that set or retrieve values into an associative array.  The key into the array is the name of the calling method after get or set.  So, if the method coming into __call is "getFirstName", the array key is "FirstName".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked using __call because it will automatically take care of the case where the subclass already has a "getFirstName" method defined.  My impression (and I may be wrong) is that the __get &amp;amp; __set magic methods don't do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here's an example of how it would work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class PropTest extends PropertyHandler
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        parent::__construct();
    }
}

$props = new PropTest();

$props-&amp;gt;setFirstName("Mark");
echo $props-&amp;gt;getFirstName();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that PropTest doesn't actually have "setFirstName" or "getFirstName" methods and neither does PropertyHandler.  All that's doing is manipulating array values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other case would be where your subclass is already extending something else.  Since you can't have true multiple inheritance in PHP, you can make your subclass have a PropertyHandler instance as a private variable.  You have to add one more function but then things behave in exactly the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class PropTest2
{
    private $props;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this-&amp;gt;props = new PropertyHandler();
    }

    public function __call($method, $arguments)
    {
        return $this-&amp;gt;props-&amp;gt;__call($method, $arguments);
    }
}

$props2 = new PropTest2();

$props2-&amp;gt;setFirstName('Mark');
echo $props2-&amp;gt;getFirstName();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice how the subclass has a __call method that just passes everything along to the PropertyHandler __call method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another good argument against handling getters and setters this way is that it makes it really hard to document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it's basically impossible to use any sort of document generation tool since the explicit methods to be don't documented don't exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've pretty much abandoned this approach for now. It was an interesting learning exercise but I think it sacrifices too much clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I like to write some evil little batch files.  You can find a command line program to do just about anything.  I prefer Batch files mostly because they are portable from one machine to another with at most a zip with a few unix tools (SSED, GREP, GAWK). there is a commandline REG.Exe that can even do Registry changes and reads.  You can parse output from commands with a "FOR /f" loop.&lt;/p&gt;

Many languages allow callback functions for regular expression matches. These can be used to propercase the match easily. The regular expression that would be used is quite simple, you just have to match all word characters, like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/\w+/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can already extract the first character to be an extra match:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/(\w)(\w*)/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can access the first character and successive characters in the match separately. The callback function can then simply return a concatenation of the hits. In pseudo Python (I don't actually know Python):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def make_proper(match):
    return match[1].to_upper + match[2]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, this would also handle the case of O'Reilly because O and Reilly would be matched separately and both propercased. There are however other special cases that are not handled well by the algorithm, e.g. McDonald's or generally any apostrophed word. The algorithm would produce Mcdonald'S for the latter. A special handling for apostrophe could be implemented but that would interfere with the first case. Finding a thereotical perfect solution isn't possible. In practice, it might help considering the length of the part after the apostrophe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This statement is the result of &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt; being inheritance unfriendly. The JLS (Java language specification) specifies that if &lt;code&gt;A.equals(B) == true&lt;/code&gt; then &lt;code&gt;B.equals(A)&lt;/code&gt; must also return &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;. If you omit that statement inheriting classes that override &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt; (and change its behavior) will break this specification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the following example of what happens when the statement is omitted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    class A {
      int field1;

      A(int field1) {
        this.field1 = field1;
      }

        return (other != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; other instanceof A &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ((A) other).field1 == field1);
      }
    }

    class B extends A {
        int field2;

        B(int field1, int field2) {
            super(field1);
            this.field2 = field2;
        }

        public boolean equals(Object other) {
            return (other != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; other instanceof B &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ((B)other).field2 == field2 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; super.equals(other));
        }
    }    
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing &lt;code&gt;new A(1).equals(new A(1))&lt;/code&gt; Also, &lt;code&gt;new B(1,1).equals(new B(1,1))&lt;/code&gt; result give out true, as it should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This looks all very good, but look what happens if we try to use both classes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;A a = new A(1);
B b = new B(1,1);
a.equals(b) == true;
b.equals(a) == false;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to ensure the symmetric condition. a=b if b=a and the Liskov substitution principle call &lt;code&gt;super.equals(other)&lt;/code&gt; not only in the case of &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; instance, but check after for &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (other instanceof B )
   return (other != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ((B)other).field2 == field2 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; super.equals(other)); 
if (other instanceof A) return super.equals(other); 
   else return false;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which will output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a.equals(b) == true;
b.equals(a) == true;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where, if &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is not a reference of &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;, then it might be a be a reference of class &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; (because you extend it), in this case you call &lt;code&gt;super.equals()&lt;/code&gt; &lt;strong&gt;too&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as already mentioned, no checking is performed here. The programmer simply cannot know which of the various casts is used which weakens strong typing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the new casts are intentionally visually striking. Since casts often reveal a weakness in the code, it's argued that making casts visible in the code is a good thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is especially true if searching for casts with an automated tool. Finding C-style casts reliably is nearly impossible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As palm3D noted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I find C++-style cast syntax too verbose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is intentional, for the reasons given above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The constructor syntax (official name: function-style cast) is semantically &lt;em&gt;the same&lt;/em&gt; as the C-style cast and should be avoided as well (except for variable initializations on declaration), for the same reasons. It is debatable whether this should be true even for types that define custom constructors but in Effective C++, Meyers argues that even in those cases you should refrain from using them. To illustrate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void f(auto_ptr&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; x);

f(static_cast&amp;lt;auto_ptr&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; &amp;gt;(new int(5))); // GOOD

&lt;p&gt;in terms of catching the "O'REILLY" example you gave
splitting the string on both spaces and ' would not work as it would capitalise any letter that appeared after a apostraphe i.e. the s in Fred's&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way you only need a thread for each concurrent operation. Sockets which are open but idle will not tie up a thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Except&lt;/strong&gt;, we are about to relaunch &lt;strong&gt;my company, the GLOBAL brand&lt;/strong&gt;, so we now need mycompany.com/uk, mycompany.com/us, and mycompany.com/au, for the various countries local content. We are using GEOIP, so if someone from the US loads mycompany.com, they get redirected to mycompany.com/us etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd start by looking at the metaphor you want to use for your thread framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe "leader follower" where a thread is listening for incoming requests and when a new request comes in it does the work and the next thread in the pool starts listening for incoming requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or thread pool where the same thread is always listening for incoming requests and then passing the requests over to the next available thread in the thread pool.&lt;/p&gt;

If at least one stakeholder says "No Go", we examine the reasons for "No Go" and, if necessary, take steps to resolve the issues behind that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In smaller projects the process may be more streamlined, and if it's just a one-person operation your set of pre-conditions may be much simpler, i.e. "the application provides a reasonable benefit, while having an (apparently) acceptable number of bugs - let's put it out there!".  As long as the benefit provided by the application over-rides the annoyance of bugs, especially if you are following the "release early and often" guideline, that might work for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am in a similar situation; I work at a company where code review doesn't take place. A colleague and I decided to implement code review anyway, so my advice from that experience would be:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it about learning about each other's approach to coding, about learning the cool tricks your colleagues know, and them learning the cool tricks you know. Sell it. Make sure your colleagues know it's &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a code audit, it's a code review and it's not about the master checking the padowan's work; it's about passionate coders talking shop and helping each other to be better at their craft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't be afraid to criticise, but &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; be careful about how you go about it (this is almost an obvious thing to say I guess...!), I often find it easier to frame criticisms in the form 'why did you choose to do x, won't that y?' - that way you're not patronising and in the case when you're wrong you won't rub people up the wrong way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a calm, quiet room to do the code review in &lt;em&gt;face-to-face&lt;/em&gt;. I can't emphasise the benefits of doing it face-to-face enough. There's far less room for miscommunication, it's so much more dynamic and useful. I actually found the first code review I had electrifying, but then again I'm a real geek :-)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're still finding it hard to get buy-in (ouch, sorry that's a little too close to management speak...), sell it on the opinions of well-respected members of industry. I mean the obvious example is &lt;a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000495.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jeff's post on the subject&lt;/a&gt;, but I don't think it'd be difficult to find many, many other opinions to the same effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that if you have comprehensive automated tests, it is utterly irresponsible to ship software unless &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of them pass. Automated tests mean that these are areas that are either core functionality or bugs that have occurred in the past that you are aware of, and can fix so as to have a passing test. It will be irresponsible to ship software that doesn't pass 100% of its automated tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One discussion is regarding passing nulls into a method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class MetricsCalculator {
    public double xProjection(Point p1, Point p2) {
        return (p2.x - p1.x) * 1.5;
    }
}
...
calculator.xProjection(null, new Point(12,13));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It represents different ways of handling this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public double xProjection(Point p1, Point p2) {
    if (p1 == null || p2 == null) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid argument for xProjection");
    }
    return (p2.x - p1.x) * 1.5;
}

public double xProjection(Point p1, Point p2) {
    assert p1 != null : "p1 should not be null";
    assert p2 != null : "p2 should not be null";
    return (p2.x - p1.x) * 1.5;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prefer the &lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/lang/assert.html"&gt;assertions&lt;/a&gt; approach, but I don't like the fact that assertions are turned off by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book finally states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In most programming languages there is no good way to deal with a null that is passed by a caller accidentally. Because this is the case, the rational approach is to forbid passing null by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn't really go into how you would enforce this restriction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do any of you have strong opinions either way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if the method simply stores the passed data, and there is some other method that you call later that will deal with it, discovering bad input as early as possible is the key to fixing bugs faster. At that later point, there could be a myriad of ways that bad data happened to be given to your class.

&lt;p&gt;As someone else said, SQL Server originally came from Sybase's SQL Server (now called Adaptive Server Enterprise), which supported NetWare at one time but dropped it a long time ago. Sybase's other RDBMS, SQL Anywhere, dropped NetWare as of version 11, but versions 9 and 10 are still supported on NW.&lt;/p&gt;

We do some fairly similar stuff on one of my projects since half of it runs on Java using Ant to run relevant targets, and the other half is .Net (C#) for the UI. The projects get run on windows machines for development, but the servers (Java) run linux, but in the UAT environment (linux) we need to run the nunits (integration tests). The real trick (not really a difficult trick) behind this is having a NAnt build file that can run in both environments which seems to be the same thing you're trying to do here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course you realise you'll need to install NAnt on Mono first:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ export MONO_NO_UNLOAD=1
$ make clean
$ make
$ mono bin/NAnt.exe clean build
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then your build file needs to be written in such a way that it seperates concerns. Some parts of the build file written for windows will not work in linux for example. So you really just need to divide it up ito specific targets in the build file. After that, there are a number of ways you can run a specific targets from the command line. An example might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;project name="DualBuild"&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;target name="WinUpdateRevision"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;delete file="${windowsSolutionPath}\Properties\AssemblyInfo.cs" /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;exec program="subwcrev.exe" basedir="C:\Program Files\TortoiseSVN\bin\"
          workingdir="${windowsSolutionPath}\Properties"
          commandline="${windowsSolutionPath} .\AssemblyInfoTemplate.cs

                       .\AssemblyInfo.cs" /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/target&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;target name="WinBuild"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;exec program="msbuild.exe"
          basedir="${windowsDotNetPath}"
          workingdir="${windowsSolutionPath}"
          commandline="MySolution.sln /logger:ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MsBuild.XmlLogger,

  &amp;lt;target name="MonoBuild"&amp;gt;
    You get the idea...
  &amp;lt;/target&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;target name="MonoTest"&amp;gt;
    You get the idea...
  &amp;lt;/target&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/project&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For brevity, I've left both sides out. The neat thing is you can use NUnit as well as NAnt on both environments and that makes things really easy from a dependency point of view. And for each executable you can swap out for others that work in that environment, for example (xBuild for MSBuild, and svn for tortoise etc)&lt;/p&gt;

What I'm wondering is why the C++ &lt;code&gt;std::fstream&lt;/code&gt; classes don't take a &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt; in their constructor or open methods. Everyone loves code examples so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;

    std::ifstream fin;

    fin.open(filename.c_str()); // Works just fine.
    fin.close();

    //fin.open(filename); // Error: no such method.
    //fin.close();
}

&lt;p&gt;This gets me all the time when working with files. Surely the C++ library would use &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt; wherever possible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** Original question: **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that concerns me as a security professional is that Ruby doesn't have a parallel of Java's package-privacy.  That is, this isn't valid Ruby:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public module Foo
  public module Bar
    # factory method for new Bar implementations
    def self.new(...)
      SimpleBarImplementation.new(...)
    end
    def baz
      raise NotImplementedError.new('Implementing Classes MUST redefine #baz')
    end
  end

  private class SimpleBarImplementation
    include Bar
    def baz
      ...
    end
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It'd be really nice to be able to prevent monkey-patching of Foo::BarImpl.  That way, people who rely on the library know that nobody has messed with it.  Imagine if somebody changed the implementation of MD5 or SHA1 on you!  I can call &lt;code&gt;freeze&lt;/code&gt; on these classes, but I have to do it on a class-by-class basis, and other scripts might modify them before I finish securing my application if I'm not &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; careful about load order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java provides lots of other tools for defensive programming, many of which are not possible in Ruby.  (See Josh Bloch's book for a good list.)  Is this really a concern?  Should I just stop complaining and use Ruby for lightweight things and not hope for "enterprise-ready" solutions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And no, core classes are not frozen by default in Ruby.  See below:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;require 'md5'
# =&amp;gt; true
MD5.frozen?
# =&amp;gt; false
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;However, if the method simply stores the passed data, and there is some other method that you call later that will deal with it, discovering bad input as early as possible is the key to fixing bugs faster. At that later point, there could be a myriad of ways that bad data happened to be given to your class. It's sort of trying to figure out how the rats came into your house after the fact, trying to find the hole somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You're right about that, these checks should only be enforced when data is only stored to be processed or used later, I didn't think of that scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;My problem with this is that adding "more logic later" requires that you add blanket logic that applies to all properties accessed with the getter/setter or that you use if or switch statements to evaluate which property you're accessing so that you can apply specific logic.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's not quite true.  Take my first example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class PropTest extends PropertyHandler
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        parent::__construct();
    }
}

$props = new PropTest();

$props-&amp;gt;setFirstName("Mark");
echo $props-&amp;gt;getFirstName();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say that I need to add some logic for validating FirstNames.  All I have to do is add a setFirstName method to my subclass and that method is automatically used instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class PropTest extends PropertyHandler
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        parent::__construct();
    }

    public function setFirstName($name)
    {
        if($name == 'Mark')
        {
            echo "I love you, Mark!";
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I'm just not satisfied with the limitations that PHP has when it comes to implicit accessor methods.  &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Specifically, when writing a test that is meant to be used by anyone including QA staff, should the steps in the test be very specific or more broad giving the tester more leeway in how the task can be accomplished.  As a very simple example, if you're testing opening a document in word processing document, should the test read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the mouse, open the file menu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose "Open File..." in the file menu&lt;/li&gt;

Alternatively, if we make it broad do we depend too much on the whims of the tester at the time and lose crucial testing of paths that are more common to customers/clients?&lt;/p&gt;

The idea is that you have a person insert intentional bugs into the system that fall into different categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cosmetic, spelling errors, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non critical errors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Critical errors and crashes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data problems. No errors occur, but something deeper is wrong with the results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 'seeder' documents exactly what was changed to insert these bugs so they can be quickly reverted. As the test team finds the seeded bugs, they are also finding real bugs, but do not know the difference. In theory, if the test team finds 90% of the seeded critical errors, then they have probably found a proportionate number of the real critical errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these statistics, you can start making judgment calls about when it is acceptable to have a release. Of course this would not be even close to foolproof due to the random nature of which bugs get found (real or seeded), but it's probably better than having no idea at all how many bugs you might be releasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First start off with a target that uses MSBuild because that will compile your project regardless of language used and take care of the dependencies for you. That means you don't need to hard code them in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;target name="WinBuild"&amp;gt;

                     /p:Configuration=Debug /target:Rebuild" /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/target&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think once you've got that nailed - you can spend plenty of time trying to get NAnt to compile natively, but in my opinion, this is what I would use for this project since it seems to be a once off?&lt;/p&gt;

With IO Completion ports you leave to the operating system to manage polling, which lets it potentially use very high level of optimization with NIC driver support.
Basically, you have a queue of network operations which is OS managed, and provide a callback function which is called when the operation completes. A bit like (Hard-drive) DMA but for network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Len Holgate wrote an eccelent series on IO completion ports a few years ago on Codeproject:
&lt;a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/IP/jbsocketserver2.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.codeproject.com/KB/IP/jbsocketserver2.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I found an article on IO completion ports for .net (haven't read it though)
&lt;a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/managediocp.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/managediocp.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also say that it is easy to use completion ports compared to try and write a scaleable alternative. The problem is that they are only available on NT (2000, XP, Vista)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even your method requires a fresh declaration of the method, and it somewhat takes away the advantage of putting it in a method so that you can add more logic, because to add more logic requires the old-fashioned declaration of the method, anyway. In its default state (which is where it is impressive in what it detects/does), your technique is offering no advantage (in PHP) over public fields. You're restricting access to the field but giving carte blanche through accessor methods that don't have any restrictions of their own. I'm not aware that unchecked explicit accessors offer any advantage over public fields in &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; language, but people can and should feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

Someone exploited a form on the site to add text to every available text-like field in the database (varchar, nvarchar, etc.) which, when rendered as HTML, includes and executes a JavaScript file. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Google search of the URL indicates that it's from email spammers based out of Romania or China, but that's not what's important right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously there's more that needs to be done (hardening the site against SQL injections, using something like markdown instead of storing HTML, etc.) and I am working on those but for the time being what I really need is a good way to go in and programmatically remove the injected text. I know what the exact text is, it's the same every time, and it's always appended to the end of any text field. I can't afford to strip out all HTML in the database at this time and I don't know when this happened exactly so I can't just roll back to a backup. Also, the site is on shared hosting and I cannot connect to the database directly with SQL Server tools. I can execute queries against it though, so if there's any way of constructing a SQL update statement to the effect of "hey find all the text fields in all of the tables in the entire database and do this to clean them" that would be the best. &lt;/p&gt;

Obviously, on a support call, we can simply inform them to do a &lt;kbd&gt;ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;F5&lt;/kbd&gt; refresh to ensure that they get the up-to-date files from the server, but it would be preferable to handle this before that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our current thought is to simply attach a version number onto the name of the JavaScript files and then when changes are made, increment the version on the script and update all references.  This definitely gets the job done, but updating the references on each release could get cumbersome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script type="text/javascript" src="myfile.js?$$REVISION$$"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this isn't too much of a non-answer to the question, but I would say you have a bit of a problem in that it would be a very open-ended algorithm which could have a lot of 'misses' as well as hits. For example, say you inputted:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;camelCase("hithisisatest");
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output could be:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;"hiThisIsATest"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;"hitHisIsATest"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's no way the algorithm would know which to prefer. You could add some extra code to specify that you'd prefer more common words, but again misses would occur (Peter Norvig wrote a very small spelling corrector over at &lt;a href="http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html&lt;/a&gt; which &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; help algorithm-wise, I wrote a &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080930045207/http://www.codegrunt.co.uk/code/cs/spellcorrect/spell-correct.cs" rel="nofollow"&gt;C# implementation&lt;/a&gt; if C#'s your language).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd agree with Mark and say you'd be better off having an algorithm that takes a delimited input, i.e. this_is_a_test and converts that. That'd be simple to implement, i.e. in pseudocode:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SetPhraseCase(phrase, CamelOrPascal):
    if no delimiters
     if camelCase
      return lowerFirstLetter(phrase)
     else
      return capitaliseFirstLetter(phrase)
    words = splitOnDelimiter(phrase)
    if camelCase 
      ret = lowerFirstLetter(first word) 
     else
      ret = capitaliseFirstLetter(first word)
    for i in 2 to len(words): ret += capitaliseFirstLetter(words[i])
    return ret

capitaliseFirstLetter(word):
    if len(word) &amp;lt;= 1 return upper(word)
    return upper(word[0]) + word[1..len(word)]

lowerFirstLetter(word):
    if len(word) &amp;lt;= 1 return lower(word)
    return lower(word[0]) + word[1..len(word)]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could also replace my capitaliseFirstLetter() function with a proper case algorithm if you so wished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A C# implementation of the above described algorithm is as follows (complete console program with test harness):-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;using System;

  static void Main(string[] args) {

    var caseAlgorithm = new CaseAlgorithm('_');

        input,
        caseAlgorithm.SetPhraseCase(input, CaseAlgorithm.CaseMode.CamelCase),
        caseAlgorithm.SetPhraseCase(input, CaseAlgorithm.CaseMode.PascalCase));
    }
  }
}

public class CaseAlgorithm {

  public enum CaseMode { PascalCase, CamelCase }

  private char delimiterChar;

  public CaseAlgorithm(char inDelimiterChar) {
    delimiterChar = inDelimiterChar;
  }

  public string SetPhraseCase(string phrase, CaseMode caseMode) {

    // You might want to do some sanity checks here like making sure
    // there's no invalid characters, etc.

    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(phrase)) return phrase;

    // .Split() will simply return a string[] of size 1 if no delimiter present so
    // no need to explicitly check this.
    var words = phrase.Split(delimiterChar);

    // Set first word accordingly.
    string ret = setWordCase(words[0], caseMode);

    // If there are other words, set them all to pascal case.
    if (words.Length &amp;gt; 1) {
      for (int i = 1; i &amp;lt; words.Length; ++i)
        ret += setWordCase(words[i], CaseMode.PascalCase);
    }

    return ret;
  }

      default:
        throw new NotImplementedException(
          string.Format("Case mode '{0}' is not recognised.", caseMode.ToString()));
    }

  &lt;p&gt;It is inconsequential, that is true. What do you mean by std::string's interface being large? What does large mean, in this context - lots of method calls? I'm not being facetious, I am actually interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has more methods than it really needs, and its behaviour of using integral offsets rather than iterators is a bit iffy (as it's contrary to the way the rest of the library works).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real issue I think is that the C++ library has three parts; it has the old C library, it has the STL, and it has strings-and-iostreams.  Though some efforts were made to bridge the different parts (e.g. the addition of overloads to the C library, because C++ supports overloading; the addition of iterators to basic_string; the addition of the iostream iterator adaptors), there are a lot of inconsistencies when you look at the detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, basic_string includes methods that are unnecessary duplicates of standard algorithms; the various find methods, could probably be safely removed. Another example: locales use raw pointers instead of iterators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important point is that the very first thing you need to do is &lt;strong&gt;take down the site&lt;/strong&gt;.  Right now you're actively serving malware to your users, and that could put you in a legal fix later.  Put up a placeholder page so your users aren't left in the dark, but don't keep serving up malware.  Then you can fix the site to make sure it's no longer vulnerable to injection.  The simplest way to do that &lt;em&gt;for this particular attack&lt;/em&gt; is to just disable sysobjects/syscolumns permissions for your web user, but you'll want to make a more through cleanup as well or it's only a matter of time until you're cracked again.  Then you can use the code provided to clean up the site and put it back live.&lt;/p&gt;

His reason is that it gives a wider range of testing, since it will test a lot of different values, whereas a normal test only uses a single static value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've given him a number of different reasons against this, the main ones being:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;random values means the test isn't truly repeatable (which also means that if the test can randomly fail, it can do so on the build server and break the build)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if it's a random value and the test fails, we need to a) fix the object and b) force ourselves to test for that value every time, so we know it works, but since it's random we don't know what the value was&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another coworker added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I am testing an exception, random values will not ensure that the test ends up in the expected state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;random data is used for flushing out a system and load testing, not for unit tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can anyone else add additional reasons I can give him to get him to stop doing this?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;if it's a random value and the test fails, we need to a) fix the object and b) force ourselves to test for that value every time, so we know it works, but since it's random we don't know what the value was&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm looking for something that will break that rule.  It should take a given schema (assuming a valid schema) and an xml input and attempt to keep going after the first error and either raise an event for each error or return a list when finished, so I can use it to generate some kind of a report of the errors in the document.  This requirement comes from above, so let's try to keep the purist &lt;em&gt;"but it wouldn't make sense to keep going"&lt;/em&gt; comments to a minimum.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm looking for something that will evaluate both whether the document is well-formed &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; whether or not it conforms to the schema.  Ideally it would evaluate those as different classes of error.  I'd prefer a .Net solution but I could use a standalone .exe as well.  If you know of one that uses a different platform go ahead and post it because someone else might find it useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I expect that most of the documents where I use this will be &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; well-formed.  Maybe an &amp;amp; included as data instead of &amp;amp;amp here and there, or an occasional mis-placed tag.  I don't expect the parser to be able to recover from anything, just to make a best-effort to keep going.  If a document is too out of whack it should spit out as much as it can followed by some kind of 'fatal, unable to continue' error.  Otherwise the schema validation part is pretty easy.&lt;/p&gt;

However, it's compact, and uses the reflection classes to only add getters / setters for properties you have already set (won't add new ones). Simply adding the getter / setter explicitly will add more complex functionality. It expects to be &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/**
* Handles default set and get calls
*/
public function __call($method, $params) {

 //did you call get or set
 if ( preg_match( "|^[gs]et([A-Z][\w]+)|", $method, $matches ) ) {

  $var = strtolower($matches[1]);

  $r = new ReflectionClass($this);
  $properties = $r-&amp;gt;getdefaultProperties();

  //if it exists
  if ( array_key_exists($var,$properties) ) {
   //set
   if ( 's' == $method[0] ) {
    $this-&amp;gt;$var = $params[0];
   }
   //get
   elseif ( 'g' == $method[0] ) {
    return $this-&amp;gt;$var;
   }
  }
 }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding this to a class where you have declared default properties like: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class MyClass {
    public $myvar = null;

$test = new MyClass;
$test-&amp;gt;setMyvar = "arapaho";

echo $test-&amp;gt;getMyvar; //echos arapaho

&lt;p&gt;The exception you are raising in your web service code is being encoded into a Soap Fault, which then being passed as a string back to your client code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are exceptions, though. One place you see buffers (output this time) is in the servlet API. Data isn't written to the underlying stream until &lt;em&gt;flush()&lt;/em&gt; is called, allowing you to buffer output but then dump the buffer if an error occurs and write an error page instead. You might buffer input if you needed to reset the stream for rereading using &lt;em&gt;mark(int)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;reset()&lt;/em&gt;. For example, maybe you'd inspect the file header before deciding on which content handler to pass the stream to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unrelated, but I think you should rewrite your stream handling. This pattern works best to avoid resource leaks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    InputStream stream = new FileInputStream("in");
    try { //no operations between open stream and try block
        //work
    } finally { //do nothing but close this one stream in the finally
        stream.close();
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are opening multiple streams, nest try/finally blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing your code is doing is making the assumption that the returned content is encoded in your VM's default character set (though that might be adequate, depending on the use case).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to learn basic drawing skills (form, mainly) and practice doing them well and right (which means slowly).  As you practice correctly, you'll improve much faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of thing that changes you from a person who says, "It doesn't look right, but I can't tell why - it's just 'off' somehow" to a person who says, "Oops, the arm is a bit long.  If I shorten the elbow end it'll change the piece in this way, if I shorten the hand end it'll change the piece this way..."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you've got to study the forms you intend to draw, and recognize their internally related parts (the body height is generally X times the size of the head, the arms and legs are related in size but vary from the torso, etc).  Same thing with buildings, physical objects, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that will really help you is understanding light and shadow - humans pick up on shape relationships based on outlines and based on shadows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Color theory is something that will make your designs attractive, or evoke certain responses and emotions, but until you get the form and lighting right the colors are not something you should stress.  One reason why art books and classes focus so much on monochrome drawings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are books and classes out there for these subjects - I could recommend some, but what you really need is to look at them yourself and pick the ones that appeal to you.  You won't want to learn if you don't like drawing fruit bowls, and that's all your book does.  Though you shouldn't avoid what you don't like, given that you're going the self taught route you should make it easy in the beginning, and then force yourself to draw the uninteresting and bland once you've got a bit of confidence and speed so you can go through those barriers more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NOLOCK hint has nothing to do with the index options. The hint tells SQL
Server not to request locks when doing SELECT operations, so there will be
no conflict with data that is already locked. The index options just tell
SQL Server that this level of locking is allowed, when locking is going to
occur. For example, if ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS was off, the only possible locks
would be page or table locks. The index options don't force locks to be
held, they just control the possible size of the locks.&lt;/p&gt;

READUNCOMMITTED hint are equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would suggest this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT page.ID, page.content, count(*) AS uniquetags FROM

You'll learn a lot.

Value physical media that you can flip through over websites; it's much quicker to flip through a picture book than it is to search your bookmarks online.

&lt;p&gt;I've used this technique to create page-level javascript classes that have their own state, this helps keep it contained (and I often identify areas that I can reuse and put into other classes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also especially useful when you have components/server controls that have their own script to execute, but when you might have multiple instances on the same page.  This keeps the state separate.&lt;/p&gt;

Gaius, you're problem is that you are setting the width's in em's.  This is a good think to do but you need to remember that em's are based on font size.  By default an input area and a textarea have different font faces &amp;amp; sizes.  So when you are setting the width to 35em, the input area is using the width of it's font and the textarea is using the width of it's font.  The text area default font is smaller, therefore the text box is smaller.  Either set the width in pixels or points, or ensure that input boxes and textareas have the same font face &amp;amp; size:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;
.mywidth { width: 35em; font-family: Verdana;  font-size: 1em; }
&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;

Would you really incorporate the data of SALES_OFFICE into CLIENT table? And if another tables need to relate them selfs with SALES_OFFICE? And what about database normalization best practices and patterns?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A foreign key column with the UNIQUE and NOT NULL constraints that references a UNIQUE, NOT NULL column in another table creates a 1:(0|1) relationship, which is probably what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of your answer is the right answer, without the second part, unless the data in second table is really a kind of information that belongs to first table and never will be used by other tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When something like that isn't available, I generally test non-private methods with a run-time null-check, and assertions for internal methods.  Rather than code the null check explicitly in each method, I delegate that to a utilities class with a check null method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/**
 * Checks to see if an object is null, and if so 
 * generates an IllegalArgumentException with a fitting message.
 * 
 * @param o The object to check against null.
 * @param name The name of the object, used to format the exception message
 *
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if o is null.
 */
public static void checkNull(Object o, String name) 
    throws IllegalArgumentException {
   if (null == o)
      throw new IllegalArgumentException(name + " must not be null");
}

public static void checkNull(Object o) throws IllegalArgumentException {
   checkNull(o, "object");
} 

// untested:
public static void checkNull(Object... os) throws IllegalArgumentException {
   for(Object o in os) checkNull(o);  
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then checking turns into:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public void someFun(String val1, String val2) throws IllegalArgumentException {
   ExceptionUtilities.checkNull(val1, "val1");
   ExceptionUtilities.checkNull(val2, "val2");

   /** alternatively:
   ExceptionUtilities.checkNull(val1, val2);
   **/

   /** ... **/
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; can be added with editor macros, or a code-processing script.
&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; The verbose check could be added this way as well, but I think it's significantly easier to automate the addition of a single line.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I am thinking more along the lines of Ruby, ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well for Ruby the &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt; interactive prompt is a great tool for "practicing" something simple.  Here are the things I'll mention about the irb to give you an idea of effective use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Automation&lt;/em&gt;.  You are allowed an &lt;code&gt;.irbrc&lt;/code&gt; file that will be automatically executed when launching irb.  That means you can load your favorite libraries or do &lt;em&gt;whatever&lt;/em&gt; you want in full Ruby automatically.  To see what I mean check out some of the ones at &lt;a href="http://dotfiles.org/.irbrc" rel="nofollow"&gt;dotfiles.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Autocompletion&lt;/em&gt;.  That even makes writing code easier.  Can't remember that string method to remove newlines?  &lt;code&gt;"".ch&amp;lt;tab&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; produces chop and chomp.  &lt;em&gt;NOTE: you have to enable autocompletion for irb yourself&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Divide and Conquer&lt;/em&gt;.  irb makes the small things really easy.  If you're writing a function to manipulate strings, the ability to test the code interactively right in the prompt saves a lot of time!  For instance you can just open up irb and start running functions on an example string and have working and tested code already ready for your library/program.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learning, Experimenting, and Hacking&lt;/em&gt;.  Something like this would take a very long time to test in C/C++, even Java.  If you tried testing them all at once you might seg-fault and have to start over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I'm just learning how the &lt;code&gt;String#[]&lt;/code&gt; function works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;joe[~]$ irb
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; "12341:asdf"[/\d+/]
# =&amp;gt; "12341"  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; "12341:asdf"[/\d*/]
# =&amp;gt; "12341"  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; "12341:asdf"[0..5]
# =&amp;gt; "12341:"  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; "12341:asdf"[0...5]
# =&amp;gt; "12341"  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; "12341:asdf"[0, ':']
TypeError: can't convert String into Integer
  from (irb):5:in `[]'
  from (irb):5
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; "12341:asdf"[0, 5]
# =&amp;gt; "12341"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Testing and Benchmarking&lt;/em&gt;.  Now they are nice and easy to perform.  &lt;a href="http://ozmm.org/posts/time_in_irb.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is someone's idea to emulate the Unix &lt;code&gt;time&lt;/code&gt; function for quick benchmarking.  Just add it to your &lt;code&gt;.irbrc&lt;/code&gt; file and its always there!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Debugging&lt;/em&gt; - I haven't used this much myself but there is always the ability to debug code &lt;a href="http://www.rubycentral.com/pickaxe/trouble.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;.  Or pull out some code and run it in the irb to see what its actually doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sure I'm missing some things but I hit on my favorite points.  You really have zero limitation in shells so you're limited only by what you can think of doing.  I almost always have a few shells running.  Bash, Javascript, and Ruby's irb to name a few. I use them for a lot of things!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;static bool GenericFunction&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(T value)

&lt;p&gt;You could wrap the number in something else (similar to &lt;code&gt;INullable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) like &lt;a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/genericnumerics.aspx"&gt;here on codeproject&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could apply the restriction at runtime (by reflecting for the operators or checking for types) but that does lose the advantage of having the generic in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an application is using LINQ to SQL and the queries involve the use of strings that can be highly variable in length, the SQL Server procedure cache will become bloated with one version of the query for every possible string length. For example, consider the following very simple queries created against the Person.AddressTypes table in the AdventureWorks2008 database:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;        var p = 
            from n in x.AddressTypes

        var p = 
            from n in x.AddressTypes 
            where n.Name == "Main Office" 
            select n;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If both of these queries are run, we will see two entries in the SQL Server procedure cache: One bound with an NVARCHAR(7), and the other with an NVARCHAR(11). Now imagine if there were hundreds or thousands of different input strings, all with different lengths. The procedure cache would become unnecessarily filled with all sorts of different plans for the exact same query. &lt;/p&gt;

I had to change one of the user ID numbers for a user account on the NIS server (I changed the userid for &lt;code&gt;username&lt;/code&gt; from 500 to 509 to avoid a conflict with a local user account with id 500 on the clients). The problem is that it has not updated properly on the client. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, if I do &lt;code&gt;ypcat passwd | grep username&lt;/code&gt;, I get the up-to-date info:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;username:*hidden*:509:509:User Name:/home/username:/bin/bash

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;username:*hidden*:500:500:User Name:/home/username:/bin/bash
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that when the user logs onto one of the clients, it has the wrong userid, which causes all sorts of problems. I've done &lt;code&gt;"cd /var/yp; make"&lt;/code&gt; on the server, and &lt;code&gt;"service ypbind restart"&lt;/code&gt; on the client, but that hasn't fixed the problem. Does anybody know what would be causing this and how I can somehow force a refresh on the client? (I'm running Fedora 8 on both client and server).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really, if you give &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; a margin and a background you should see it surrounded by a white strip. However this isn't the case - &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt;'s padding is the same as margin. This establishes a few incorrect things about the box model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that what you would do after the check.  The Javascript call would probably send some sort of response "OK! This is really Niyaz@diovo.com" back to your server.  An attacker could just stop the script and send that response manually without doing any checks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could prevent this by doing some sort of hashing / signature on the response, but then your server would have to validate the signature.  It's easier to just validate the email/password combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;excessive GC (% Time in GC going up. Also, Perfmon GC and CPU counters would correspond)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;excessive threads and associated context switches (# of threads going up)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;polling (stack traces are consistently caught in a single function)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;excessive kernel time (kernel times are high - Task Manager shows large kernel time numbers when CPU is high)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exceptions (PE .NET tab Exceptions thrown is high and getting higher. There's also a Perfmon counter)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;virus/rootkit (OK, this is a last ditch scenario - but it is possible to construct a rootkit that hides from TaskManager.

I understand the process of a client receiving mail from a server using POP pretty well.  I also understand how a client computer can use SMTP to ask an SMTP server to send a message.  However, I'm still missing something...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I understand it, outgoing mail has to make three trips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Client (gmail user using Thunderbird) to a server (Gmail)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First server (Gmail) to second server (Hotmail)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second server (Hotmail) to second client (hotmail user using OS X Mail)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I understand it, step one uses SMTP for the client to communicate.  The client authenticates itself somehow (say, with USER and PASS), and then sends a message to the gmail server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I don't understand how gmail server transfers the message to the hotmail server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For step three, I'm pretty sure, the hotmail server uses POP to send the message to the hotmail client (using authentication, again).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the big question is: &lt;strong&gt;when I click send Mail sends my message to my gmail server, how does my gmail server forward the message to, say, a hotmail server so my friend can recieve it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~Jason&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, that's been helpful so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I understand it, the first client sends the message to the first server using SMTP, often to an address such as smtp.mail.SOMESERVER.com on port 25 (usually).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, SOMESERVER uses SMTP again to send the message to RECEIVESERVER.com on port 25 (not smtp.mail.RECEIVESERVER.com or anything fancy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, when the recipient asks RECEIVESERVER for its mail, using POP, s/he recieves the message... right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks again (especially to dr-jan),&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, since you are only wanting to allow the function to work on int data types then you shouldn't need a separate function for each specific size. Simply taking a parameter in the largest specific type will allow the program to automatically upcast the smaller data types to it. (i.e. passing an Int16 will auto-convert to Int64 when calling).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are performing different operations based on the actual size of int being passed into the function then I would think you should seriously reconsider even trying to do what you are doing. If you have to fool the language you should think a bit more about what you are trying to accomplish rather than how to do what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failing all else, a parameter of type Object could be used and then you will have to check the type of the parameter and take appropriate action or throw an exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You have a table CLIENT that has a 1:1 relationship with table SALES_OFFICE because, for example, the logic of your system says so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What your app logic says, and what your data model say are 2 different things. There is nothing wrong with enforcing that relationship with your business logic code, but it has no place in the data model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Would you really incorporate the data of SALES_OFFICE into CLIENT table? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If every CLIENT has a unique SALES_OFFICE, and every SALES_OFFICE has a singular, unique CLIENT - then yes, they should be in the same table. We just need a better name. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And if another tables need to relate them selfs with SALES_OFFICE? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's no reason to. Relate your other tables to CLIENT, since CLIENT has a unique SALES_OFFICE. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And what about database normalization best practices and patterns?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; normalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, SALES_OFFICE and CLIENT is obviously not a 1:1 relationship - it's 1:N. Hopefully, your SALES_OFFICE exists to serve more than 1 client, and will continue to exist (for a while, at least) without any clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more realistic example is SALES_OFFICE and ZIP_CODE. A SALES_OFFICE must have exactly 1 ZIP_CODE, and 2 SALES_OFFICEs - even if they have an equivalent ZIP_CODE - do not share the &lt;em&gt;instance&lt;/em&gt; of a ZIP_CODE (so, changing the ZIP_CODE of 1 does not impact the other). Wouldn't you agree that ZIP_CODE belongs as a column in SALES_OFFICE?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does this by using DNS to find the MX (mail exchanger) record for the domain name part of the destination email address (hotmail.com in this example). The DNS server will return an IP address which the message should be sent to. The server at the destination IP address will hopefully be running SMTP (on the standard port 25) so it can receive the incoming messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the message has been received by the hotmail server, it is stored until the appropriate user logs in and retrieves their messages using POP (or IMAP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason - to answer your follow up...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then, SOMESERVER uses SMTP again to send the message to RECEIVESERVER.com on port 25 (not smtp.mail.RECEIVESERVER.com or anything fancy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's correct - the domain name to send to is taken as everything after the '@' in the email address of the recipient. Often, RECEIVESERVER.com is an alias for something more specific, say something like incoming.RECEIVESERVER.com, (or, indeed, smtp.mail.RECEIVESERVER.com).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use nslookup to query your local DNS servers (this works in Linux and in a Windows cmd window):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;nslookup

&amp;gt; stackoverflow.com

Non-authoritative answer:
stackoverflow.com       mail exchanger = 10 aspmx.l.google.com.
stackoverflow.com       mail exchanger = 20 alt1.aspmx.l.google.com.
stackoverflow.com       mail exchanger = 30 alt2.aspmx.l.google.com.
stackoverflow.com       mail exchanger = 40 aspmx2.googlemail.com.
stackoverflow.com       mail exchanger = 50 aspmx3.googlemail.com.

Authoritative answers can be found from:

&lt;p&gt;First, you need to find, in the registry, the &lt;strong&gt;key&lt;/strong&gt; that represents the zone you want ("Central Standard Time" is an example). Those are located here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\Current Version\Time Zones&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with that in mind, create a batch file, "SetTimeZone.bat" with the following line in it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;RunDLL32 shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL %SystemRoot%\system32\TIMEDATE.cpl,,/Z %1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From C#, call:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("SetTimeZone.bat", "The key of the time zone you want to set");&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My handler calculates and sets an entity-tag (using the SetETag method on the HttpCachePolicy associated with the current response object). If I set the cache-control to public using the SetCacheability method everything works like a charm and the server sends along the e-tag header. If I set it to private the e-tag header will be suppressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I just haven't looked hard enough but I haven't seen anything in the HTTP/1.1 spec that would justify this behavior. Why wouldn't you want to send E-Tag to browsers while still prohibiting proxies from storing the data?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;using System;
using System.Web;

public class Handler : IHttpHandler {
    public void ProcessRequest (HttpContext ctx) {
        ctx.Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.Private);
        ctx.Response.Cache.SetETag("\"static\"");
        ctx.Response.ContentType = "text/plain";
        ctx.Response.Write("Hello World");
    }

    public bool IsReusable { get { return true; } }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will return&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Cache-Control: private
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 11
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if we change it to public it'll return&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Cache-Control: public
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 11
Etag: "static"
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've run this on the ASP.NET development server and IIS6 so far with the same results. Also I'm unable to explicitly set the ETag using&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Response.AppendHeader("ETag", "static")
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: It's possible to append the ETag header manually when running in IIS7, I suspect this is caused by the tight integration between ASP.NET and the IIS7 pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarification&lt;/strong&gt;: It's a long question but the core question is this: &lt;strong&gt;why does ASP.NET do this, how can I get around it and should I?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: I'm going to accept &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32824/why-does-httpcacheabilityprivate-suppress-etags#34004"&gt;Tony's answer&lt;/a&gt; since it's essentially correct (go Tony!). I found that if you want to emulate the HttpCacheability.Private fully you can set the cacheability to ServerAndPrivate but you also have call cache.&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.httpcachepolicy.setomitvarystar.aspx"&gt;SetOmitVaryStar&lt;/a&gt;(true) otherwise the cache will add the &lt;strong&gt;Vary: *&lt;/strong&gt; header to the output and you don't want that. I'll edit that into the answer when I get edit permissions (or if you see this Tony perhaps you could edit your answer to include that call?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Persistent set of messages, possibly updating, to stay there until the sender says to remove them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The libraries will be written in C#.  Spring.NET just released a milestone build with lots of nice messaging abstraction, which is great - I plan on using it extensively.  My basic question comes down to the question of message brokers.  My architecture will look something like app -&gt; message broker queue -&gt; server app that listens, dispatches all messages to where they need to go, and handles the life cycle of those long-lived messages -&gt; message broker queue or topic -&gt; listening apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the question:  Which message broker should I use?  I am biased towards &lt;a href="http://activemq.apache.org"&gt;ActiveMQ&lt;/a&gt; - We used it on our last project and loved it.  I can't really think of a single strike against it, except that it's Java, and will require java to be installed on a server somewhere, and that might be a hard sell to some of the people that will be using this service.  The other option I've been looking at is MSMQ.  I am biased against it for some unknown reason, and it also doesn't seem to have great multicast support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone used MSMQ for something like this?  Any pros or cons, stuff that might sway the vote one way or the other?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last thing, we are using .NET 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;

In other words, since your client can send email via SMTP, and it can use DNS to get the the MX record for hotmail.com, why doesn't it just send it there directly, skipping gmail.com altogether?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of reasons, some historical and some for security. In the original question, it was assumed that your Thunderbird client logs in with a user name and password. This is often not the case. SMTP doesn't actually require a login to send a mail. And SMTP has no way to tell who's really sending the mail. Thus, spam was born! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, unfortunately, still many SMTP servers out there that allow anyone and everyone to connect and send mail, trusting blindly that the sender is who they claim to be. These servers are called "open relays" and are routinely black-listed by smarter administrators of other mail servers, because of the spam they churn out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responsible SMTP server admins set up their server to accept mail for delivery only in special cases 1) the mail is coming from "its own" network, or 2) the mail is being sent to "its own" network, or 3) the user presents credentials that identifies him as a trusted sender. Case #1 is probably what happens when you send mail from work; your machine is on the trusted network, so you can send mail to anyone. A lot of corporate mail servers still don't require authentication, so you can impersonate anyone in your office. Fun! Case #2 is when someone sends you mail. And case #3 is probably what happens with your GMail example. You're not coming from a trusted network, your just out on the Internet with the spammers. But by using a password, you can prove to GMail that you are who you say you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The historical aspect is that in the old days, the link between gmail and hotmail was likely to be intermittent. By queuing your mail up at a local server, you could wash your hands of it, knowing that when a link was established, the local server could transfer your messages to the remote server, which would hold the message until the recipient's agent picked it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.) Remove dead code.  Unless something is absolutely essential, commented-out, dead code should be removed.  It clutters up a routine, you'll often get false positives when you search for some string and it shows a general sloppiness that's not good for a professional developer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.) For maintenance fixes, reference a defect tracking number in a comment--assuming you have some sort of defect tracking system.  This makes it easier for anyone maintaining your work to figure out why the code was changed between one revision and another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.) For languages that support it, declare variables as close as possible to their first use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sure there are a few other language-agnostic concepts but these are the first few that come to mind.  As far as I know, it's relatively difficult to discuss coding standards in absence of a specific language.

&lt;p&gt;The author described "Transactional Programming".  This is analogous to the transactions in data bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start transaction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encounter error during step 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roll back to before transaction started.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a new framework, but you can look at it more as a solution rather then using the framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using transactions, you get the "Restore Points" that you're looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

Here's the problem I'm encountering. I'm working with Java code in Eclipse, and I wanted to comment out a block of code.

  &lt;p&gt;fatal error&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;[Definition:] An error which a conforming XML processor must detect and report to the application. After encountering a fatal error, the processor may continue processing the data to search for further errors and may report such errors to the application. In order to support correction of errors, the processor may make unprocessed data from the document (with intermingled character data and markup) available to the application. Once a fatal error is detected, however, the processor must not continue normal processing (i.e., it must not continue to pass character data and information about the document's logical structure to the application in the normal way).&lt;/p&gt;

A full system restore point is weighty - it takes time to create, disk space to store, and gets added to the interface of restore points, possibly pushing earlier restore points out of storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if your update is really only changing &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; application (i.e. the data it stores, the binaries that make it up, the registry entries for it), then it's not really a system level change, and I'd vote for no restore point. You can emulate the functionality by just backing up the parts you're changing, and offering a restore to backup option. My opinion is that System Restore should be to restore the system when global changes are made that might corrupt it (application install, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The counter argument that one should just use the system service doesn't hold water for me; I worry that, if you have to issue a number of updates to your application, the set of system restore points might get so large that important, real "system wide" updates might get pushed out, or lost in the noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until early 2007 validator controls were not compatible with UpdatePanels. This was resolved with the SP1 of the .NET Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source of the problem is that UpdatePanel can detect markup changes in your page, but it has no way to track scripts correctly. Validators rely heavily on scripts. During a partial postback, the scripts are either blown away, not updated, or not run when they are meant to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early betas, MS had the UpdatePanel try to &lt;em&gt;guess&lt;/em&gt; what scripts needed to be re-rendered or run. It didn't work very well, and they had to take it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get around the immediate problem, Microsoft released a patched version of the validator classes in a new DLL called Validators.DLL, and gave instructions on how to tell ASP.NET to use those classes instead of the real ones. If you Google for that DLL name, you should find more information. See also &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mattgi/archive/2007/01/23/asp-net-ajax-validators.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;This blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a stop-gag measure and you should &lt;strike&gt;not use it&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;em&gt;avoid it if possible&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real solution to the problem came shortly after, in .NET 2.0 SP1. Microsoft introduced a new mechanism to register scripts in SP1, and changed the real validator classes to use that mechanism instead of the older one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me give you some details on the changes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, you were supposed to register scripts via Page methods such as Page.RegisterStartupScript() and Page.RegisterClientScriptBlock(). The problem is that these methods were not designed for extensibility and UpdatePanel had no way to monitor those calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In SP1 there is a new property object on the page called Page.ClientScripts. This object has methods to register scripts that are equivalent (and in some ways better) to the original ones. Also, UpdatePanel can monitor these calls, so that it rerenders or calls the methods when appropriate. The older RegisterStartupScript(), etc. methods have been deprecated. They still work, but not inside an UpdatePanel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no reason (other than politics, I suppose) to not update your installations to .NET 2.0 SP1. Service Packs carry important fixes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

An open network can allow a determined person to 'listen' to all your unencrypted communication. This will include emails - probably forum posts - things like this.

Passwords / Secure log in to servers will be encrypted already so there is no benefit to the encryption while the packets are in the air. The advantage comes when, as others have mentioned, users perform illegal actions on your access point.

The design guidelines mostly focus on designing public APIs; what you do with your private members is up to you.  I'm not positive but I'm relatively confident that private members are not considered when the compiler checks for CLS compliance, because only public/protected members come in to play there (the idea is, "What if someone who uses a language that doesn't allow the _ character tries to use your library?"  If the members are private, the answer is  "Nothing, the user doesn't have to use these members." but if the members are public you're in trouble.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I'm going to add to the echo chamber and point out that whatever you do, it's important to be consistent.  My employer mandates that private fields in both C# and VB are prefixed with _, and because all of us follow this convention it is easy to use code written by someone else.  &lt;/p&gt;

With Objective-C 2.0 most enumerations now default to &lt;code&gt;NSFastEnumeration&lt;/code&gt; which creates a buffer of the addresses to each object in the collection that it can then deliver. The one step that you save over the classic for loop is not having to call &lt;code&gt;objectAtIndex:i&lt;/code&gt; each time inside the loop. The internals of the collection you are enumerating implement fast enumeration with out calling &lt;code&gt;objectAtIndex:i method&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The buffer is part of the reason that you can't mutate a collection as you enumerate, the address of the objects will change and the buffer that was built will no longer match. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a bonus the format in 2.0 looks as nice as the classic for loop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for ( Type newVariable in expression ) {

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090527141110/http://www.kimbly.com/blog/000331.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;article describes&lt;/a&gt; another developers frustrations searching for C++ code coverage tools.  The author's final solution was &lt;a href="http://www.bullseye.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Bullseye Coverage&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bullseye.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Bullseye Coverage&lt;/a&gt; features:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bullseye.com/platform.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cross Platform Support&lt;/a&gt; (win32, unix, and embedded), (supports linux gcc compilers and MSVC6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bullseye.com/usability.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Easy to use&lt;/a&gt; (up and running in a few hours).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bullseye.com/measurementTechnique.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Provides "best" metrics&lt;/a&gt;: Function Coverage and Condition/Decision Coverage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses source code instrumentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for hooking into your continuous integration, it depends on which CI solution you use, but you can likely hook the instrumentation / coverage measurement steps into the make file you use for automated testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Testing Linux vs Windows?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So long as all your tests run correctly in both environments, you should be fine measuring coverage on one or the other.  (Though Bullseye appears &lt;a href="http://www.bullseye.com/platform.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;to support both platforms&lt;/a&gt;).  But why aren't you doing continuous integration builds in both environments??  If you deliver to clients in both environments then you &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to be testing in both.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that reason, it sounds like you might need to have two continuous build servers set up, one for a linux build and one for a windows build.  Perhaps this can be easily accomplished with some virtualization software like &lt;a href="http://www.vmware.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;vmware&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;virtualbox&lt;/a&gt;.  You may not need to run code coverage metrics on both OSs, but you should definitely be running your unit tests on both.&lt;/p&gt;

So the team argued about this a little bit, and one developer found a post about letting the file download to the file system and having the antivirus software that protects the network check the files there.

&lt;p&gt;I need help with a fairly specialized problem: my firm sells an expansion card that requires custom firmware. Currently we use an extremely old live CD image of RH7.2 that we update with current firmware. Manufacturing puts the cards in a machine, boots off the CD, the CD writes the firmware, they power off and pull the cards. Because of this cycle, it's essential that the CD boot and shut down as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that with the next generation of cards, I have to update the CD to a 2.6 kernel. It's easy enough to acquire a pre-existing live CD - but those all are designed for showing off Linux on the desktop - which means they take forever to boot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Update:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, just as a final update for anyone reading this later - the tool I ended up using was "livecd-creator".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My reason for choosing this tool was that it is available for RedHat-based distributions like CentOs, Fedora and RHEL - which are all distributions that my company supports already. In addition, while the project is very poorly documented it is extremely customizable. I was able to create a minimal LiveCD and edit the boot sequence so that it booted directly into the firmware updater instead of a bash shell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of differing opinion on what methods to use when developing software. If you haven't already, try googling or Wikipedia-ing some of the more common buzzwords in use today: Waterfall, Agile, Test-Driven, Scrum, RAD. There's volumes of stuff written about these ideas and their relative strengths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing to understand is that the software development industry doesn't have a very good idea about what the life cycle of development &lt;em&gt;should be&lt;/em&gt;. There's been lots of study about what it it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;, but usually that study is accompanied by commentary that talks about how badly it's failed. As such, there's been several schisms in the SDLC space over the past 15 years or so, as people and companies invent &amp;amp; implement new ways of building software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, schools don't handle this sort of situation very well. They want to be able to teach a particular idea with enough depth to fill a semester-long course. SDLC doesn't fit with that very well, as there's many (often conflicting) schools of thought. These may be too new to be really understood well (you have to really understand something to be able to teach it), or they might be too deep to really get into in a classroom setting. The best most college classes can do is to pick up older SDLC ideas and materials (some of which may already be out of date in the industry) and teach that as one example of how its done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individual companies will each have their own take on SDLC (in fact some will have multiple takes depending on the department). In fact, one of the things you'll want to ask about when settling into your career is how they go about doing their development. For instance, I appreciate working in an agile, high-flexibility (some would say chaotic) development environment with highly-skilled coworkers. That's not necessarily good for everyone; developers with less skill and/or confidence might prefer a more structured, top-down approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My best advice would be to not expect to have an "answer" to the question of SDLC. Instead, be prepared to read/listen to the experiences of others and try to come to your own conclusions about how to build software. Stay flexible, read a lot (especially websites where the information is newer), and possibly attend conferences if you can. Once you get comfortable doing development you'll be able to understand the issues better and perhaps contribute to a better solution.&lt;/p&gt;

This would not help me to set up standard build directories for our projects, unfortunately. And having these events create &lt;strong&gt;batch files&lt;/strong&gt; seems like a very 1980's approach for a modern language like C#, IMO. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After digging some more, and experimenting, I have found that you can add an &amp;lt;Import&amp;gt; directive into your .csproj file. When you do this, the IDE pops up a warning dialog that there is an unsafe entry point in your project - but you can ignore this, and you can make it not appear at all by editing a registry entry, evidently. So this would give me a way to get the variables containing the directory paths I need into the .csproj file. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to get the Output Path to refer to it - unfortunately when you add a string like "$(MySpecialPath)/Debug" to the Output Path field, and save the project, the $ and () chars are converted to hex, and your file get's put in a Debug directory under a directory named "$(MySpecialPath)". Arrgghh. If you edit the .csproj file in a text editor, you can set this correctly however, and it seems to work as long as the &amp;lt;Import&amp;gt; tag appears before the &amp;lt;PropertyGroup&amp;gt; containing the Output Path. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I think the solution for me will be to create a standard OurTeam.targets MsBuild file in a standard location, add an installer for changing the registry so it doesn't flag warnings, and then create custom project templates that &amp;lt;Import&amp;gt; this file, and also set the Output Path to use the properties defined in the OurTeam.targets file. Sadly, this is more work and a less elegant solution than the property sheet inheritance mechanism in C++.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's how I got my panel updated &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the initial page render was complete...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;default.aspx&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &amp;lt;%@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeBehind="Default.aspx.cs" Inherits="AJAXPostLoadCall._Default" %&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" &amp;gt;
&amp;lt;head runat="server"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Untitled Page&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;form id="form1" runat="server"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;And now for a magic trick...&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;asp:ScriptManager ID="ScriptManager1" runat="server" EnablePartialRendering="True"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/asp:ScriptManager&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;asp:UpdatePanel ID="UpdatePanel1" runat="server"&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;ContentTemplate&amp;gt;
                    &amp;lt;asp:Timer ID="Timer1" runat="server" Interval="2000" ontick="Timer1_Tick" /&amp;gt;
                    &amp;lt;asp:Label ID="Label1" runat="server"&amp;gt;Something magic is about to happen...&amp;lt;/asp:Label&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;/ContentTemplate&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/asp:UpdatePanel&amp;gt;

        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the code behind default.aspx.cs reads&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;using System;
using System.Collections;
using System.Configuration;
using System.Data;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.Security;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web.UI.HtmlControls;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts;
using System.Xml.Linq;

namespace AJAXPostLoadCall
{
    public partial class _Default : System.Web.UI.Page
    {

        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
        }

        public void DoMagic()
        {
            Label1.Text = "Abracadabra";
        }

        protected void Timer1_Tick(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Do the magic, then disable the timer
            DoMagic();
            Timer1.Enabled = false;
        }

    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the page loads up and the Timer (contained within the UpdatePanel) fires 2 secs after the page has loaded up (I think - I'm not sure when the Timer actually starts?).  The label text is rewritten and then the Timer is disabled to stop any more updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple enough - but can you purists out there tell me if this is a Horrible Hack?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will probably be a little faster. However, you run a greater risk of running into deadlocks, losing uncommitted changes should something catastrophic happen (cleaning lady unplugs the server), FUD, Fire, Brimstone, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, there's no system that lets you determine when the paint event is raised.

&lt;p&gt;Well, this isn't true, but why you would &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; it to print both, I can't find a use case for. It's defeating the point of having an if statement. The likely "real" solution is to not use an if at all. Silly interview questions... :)&lt;/p&gt;

If you wrote an application, do you want users to be able to inject things into your application (more importantly, would you want to incur the support/revenue headache of clueless users doing this and then blaming you)? Each application's drag and drop infrastructure is written specifically for the application, not to allow you to drop anything you want onto it (potentially causing crashes and all sorts of other nasty behaviour when you drag something onto an app that simply can't handle it). Stuff like this is hard to do for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible to do, but it's a lot of work: you need to acquire the window handle of the thing you want to drop something onto, and then replace that window's message handler with your own.

&lt;p&gt;Okay, there are several Live-CDs that are designed to be very small, in order to e.g. fit on a business card sized CD. Some were also designed to be booted from a USB stick, back when that meant 64-128 MiByte: &lt;a href="http://DamnSmallLinux.Org/" rel="nofollow" title="Damn Small Linux"&gt;Damn Small Linux&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best known ones, however it uses a 2.4 kernel. There is a sister project called &lt;a href="http://DamnSmallLinux.Org/dsl-n/" rel="nofollow" title="Damn Small Linux - Not"&gt;Damn Small Linux - Not&lt;/a&gt;, which has a 2.6 kernel (although it seems it hasn't been updated in years).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another project worth noting is &lt;a href="http://grml.org/" rel="nofollow" title="grml"&gt;grml&lt;/a&gt;, a Live-CD for system administration tasks. It does not boot into a graphic environment, and is therefore quite fast; however, it still contains about 2 GiByte of software compressed onto a CD-ROM. But it also has a smaller flavor, aptly named &lt;a href="http://grml.org/faq/#whatissmall" rel="nofollow" title="grml-small"&gt;grml-small&lt;/a&gt;, which only contains about 200 MiByte of software compressed into 60 MiByte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is &lt;a href="http://Morphix.Org/" rel="nofollow" title="Morphix"&gt;Morphix&lt;/a&gt;, which is a Live-CD builder toolkit based on &lt;a href="http://Knoppix.De/" rel="nofollow" title="Knoppix"&gt;Knoppix&lt;/a&gt;.

It uses various techniques to massively speed up the boot process. I believe they even trace the order in which blocks are accessed during booting and then remaster the ISO so that those blocks are laid out contiguously on the medium.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks to &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1322/matt-mcminn" rel="nofollow"&gt;Matt McMinn&lt;/a&gt;, I have settled on this implementation.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6x6y6z4d.aspx"&gt;true operator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6292hy1k.aspx"&gt;false operator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I understand this right these operators can be used in types which I want to use instead of a boolean expression and where I don't want to provide an implicit conversion to bool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say I have a following class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    public class MyType
    {
        public readonly int Value;

        public MyType(int value)
        {
            Value = value;
        }

        public static bool operator true (MyType mt)
        {
            return  mt.Value &amp;gt; 0;
        }

        public static bool operator false (MyType mt)
        {
            return  mt.Value &amp;lt; 0;
        }

    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I can write the following code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    MyType mTrue = new MyType(100);
    MyType mFalse = new MyType(-100);
    MyType mDontKnow = new MyType(0);

    if (mTrue)
    {
         // Do something.
    }

    while (mFalse)
    {
        // Do something else.
    }

    do
    {
        // Another code comes here.
    } while (mDontKnow)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However for all the examples above only the true operator is executed. So what's the false operator in C# good for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Facelets &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ui:insert/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag is comparable to the ASP.NET &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;asp:ContentPlaceHolder/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag used in master pages; it lets you provide default content for that area of the page, but this can be overridden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fill the Facelets template in another page, you start with a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ui:composition/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element that points to the template file.  This is roughly equivalent to declaring the MasterPageFile attribute in an ASP.NET page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ui:composition/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element, you use &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ui:define/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements to override the template defaults, similar to the way an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;asp:Content/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag is used.  These elements can contain any kind of content - from simple strings to JSF elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to bring it all together...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;master.xhtml&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- HTML header content here --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ui:insert name="AreaOne"&amp;gt;Default content for AreaOne&amp;lt;/ui:insert&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ui:insert name="AreaTwo"&amp;gt;Default content for AreaTwo&amp;lt;/ui:insert&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!-- HTML footer content here --&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;page.xhtml&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ui:composition template="/WEB-INF/templates/master.xhtml"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;ui:define name="AreaOne"&amp;gt;Here is some new content&amp;lt;/ui:define&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;ui:define name="AreaTwo"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some new content here too&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/ui:define&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ui:composition&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this will render as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- HTML header content here --&amp;gt;
Here is some new content
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some new content here too&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!-- HTML footer content here --&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also get some other benefits with Facelets, such as the ability to reuse page components with different data.&lt;/p&gt;

This  won't change the data of the actual key (which I'm guessing you have stored in a constant somewhere). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you just want to make it somewhat harder to see, you could run a simple cipher on the plaintext (like ROT-13 or something) so that it's at least not stored in the clear in the code itself. But that's certainly not going to stop any determined hacker from accessing your key. A stronger encryption method won't help because you'd still need to store the key for THAT in the code, and there's nothing protecting that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only really secure thing I can think of is to keep the key outside of the application somehow, and then restrict access to the key. For instance, you could keep the key in a separate file and then protected the file with an OS-level user-based restriction; that would probably work. You could do the same with a database connection (again, relying on the user-based access restriction to keep non-authorized users out of the database). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;You could set up restrictions for each page in your web.config file.  This would allow you to have whatever folder hierarchy you wish to use.  However, it will require that you keep the web.config file up to date whenever you add additional pages.  The nice part of having the folder structure determine accessibility is that you don't have to think about it when you add in new pages.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Create a base page called 'SecurePage' or something to that effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a property 'AllowedUserRoles' to the base page that is a generic list of user roles List or List where int is the role id.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Page_Load event of any page extending SecurePage you add each allowed user role to the AllowedUserroles property.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the base page override OnLoad() and check if the current user has one of the roles listed in AllowedUserRoles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some haystacks have an integrated search strategy as part of their implementation; associative containers (hashed or ordered sets and maps) all do, for instance.

Thus you would store an internal value indicating whether the value is true or false or null, i.e. in your example &gt;0 for true, &amp;lt;0 for false and ==0 for null, and then you'd get SQL-style null semantics. You would also have to implement a .IsNull method or property in order that nullity could be checked explicitly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing to SQL, imagine a table Table with 3 rows with value Foo set to true, 3 rows with value Foo set to false and 3 rows with value Foo set to null.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Table WHERE Foo = TRUE OR Foo = FALSE
6
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to count all rows you'd have to do the following:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Table WHERE Foo = TRUE OR Foo = FALSE OR Foo IS NULL
9
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 'IS NULL' syntax would have equivilent code in your class as .IsNull().&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LINQ makes the comparison to C# even clearer:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int totalCount = (from s in MyTypeEnumerable
                 where s || !s
                 select s).Count();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagining that MyTypeEnumberable has exactly the same contents of the database, i.e. 3 values equal to true, 3 values equal to false and 3 values equal to null. In this case totalCount would evaluate to 6 in this case. However, if we re-wrote the code as:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int totalCount = (from s in MyTypeEnumerable
                 where s || !s || s.IsNull()
                 select s).Count();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then totalCount would evaluate to 9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DBNull example given in the linked MSDN article on the false operator demonstrates a class in the BCL which has this exact behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In effect the conclusion is you shouldn't use this unless you're completely sure you want this type of behaviour, it's better to just use the far simpler nullable syntax!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I just noticed you need to manually override the logic operators !, || and &amp;amp;&amp;amp; to make this work properly. I believe the false operator feeds into these logical operators, i.e. indicating truth, falsity or 'otherwise'. As noted in another comment !x won't work off the bat; you have to overload !. Weirdness!&lt;/p&gt;

Since you don't need compression, you could run the mksquashfs step (present in most tutorials) with -noDataCompression and -noFragmentCompression to save on decompression time.  You may even be able to drop the squashfs approach entirely, but this would require some restructuring.  This may actually be slower depending on your CD-ROM read speed vs. CPU speed, but it's worth looking into.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm trying to get at a sub-folder in a document library in the "Define Workflow Lookup" dialog.  There are two issues with this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can't look up items by URL Path. If I look up by Title, I can
output the URL Path, but selecting by path doesn't work.  What
fields can/can't I use?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can't get at any sub-folders.  I can get at the top-level folder,
but the sub-folders don't seem to be available. Noticed the same
things is true when looking at the data for a document library in
the "Data Source Library" in Designer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clarify, the workflow is on a different list, not on the document library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPD:&lt;/strong&gt; Also, I know how to do this through the object model, the question is how to do it in SharePoint Designer without deploying code to the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is something fundamentally brain-altering about jQuery. Even if you don't end up using it, you should at least look at it. Most frameworks feel like "stuff designed by non-Javascript OO developers", whereas jQuery feels like it was designed by someone steeped in the power of Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

level using #permit and #permit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorization using roles for the entire application, a model class, or an
instance of a model (i.e., a particular object).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some english-like dynamic methods that draw on the defined roles. You will be
able to use methods like "user.is_fan_of angelina" or "angelina.has_fans?",
where a 'fan' is only defined in the roles table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pick-and-choose a mixin for your desired level of database complexity. For
all the features, you will want to use "object roles table" (see below)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;static bool IntegerFunction(Int64 value) { }

There are a ton of ASP.NET developers (including those behind this very site) out there who use it if you are trying to figure out how to get rocking &amp;amp; rolling, right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would check out the following blogs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://west-wind.com/Weblog/"&gt;Rick Strahl's Web Log&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ever talented Scott Guthrie mentioned &lt;a href="http://mattberseth.com/"&gt;Matt Berseth&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And my personal favorite Dave Ward's blog &lt;a href="http://encosia.com/"&gt;Encosia&lt;/a&gt;. (I think &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/60/dave-ward"&gt;this is his StackOverflow profile&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, of course there are plenty of other libraries out there. In the end I really like JS Libraries because it frequently comes down to code re-use. Don't roll the same JS functionality from scratch over-and-over. Also, most of these community previewed products have had a helluva lot more eyes on the code than anything you roll yourself (probably). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of that said, I also highly suggest checking out these frameworks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://extjs.com/"&gt;Ext JS&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mochikit.com/"&gt;MochiKit&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Also check out Omar Al Zabir's (founder of &lt;a href="http://www.pageflakes.com/"&gt;PageFlakes.com&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/ajax/MakingGoogleIG.aspx"&gt;CodeProject article&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0596510500"&gt;his book&lt;/a&gt; for cool stuff you can do with the ASP.NET AJAX Framework.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe Ext JS comes out of the box with ColdFusion installations these days, but I have been happy with the few .NET projects I dropped it into as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience is that generally the bug is related to code that is near the area of breakage. That is to say, if you are seeing an issue arising in the function "LoadConfigInfoFromFile" then probably you should start by closely analysing that for issues, rather than "DrawControlsOnScreen", if you know what I mean. "Spooky action at a distance" type bugs do not tend to arise often (although when they do, they tend to be a major bear).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I'm wondering...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How efficient are Lists?
How much memory overhead do I get for each of them? (that is, memory space in addition to what the objects they contain would take)
How much of a penalty do I pay every time I instance a new one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a more efficient way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dictionaries are just HashTables, right? Or are them a less efficient data structure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd like to use Arrays, but I have the typical problem of adding and removing things all the time from them, so having to grow / shrink them would be a pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any ideas/suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I know my basic data structures 101, and why a Linked List is better for adding/removing, and a HashTable is better for Random Access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm mostly concerned about .Net's idionsyncracies. How much memory each of these structure wastes, for example. And time wasted on initializing / killing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things like, for example, if it takes a lot of time to instance/GC a List, but not much to clear it, maybe I should keep a little pool of Lists waiting for me, and clear them and send them back to the pool when done, instead of simply dereferencing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, if Hashtables are faster for access but waste a lot of memory, I might prefer to use Lists and traverse them, for small item counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I'd also really like to focus on memory usage, since my app is hediously memory intensive (think memcached like)...
Does anyone know where I can find such info?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're just querying stuff then it's fine to create them as needed, but then if later you want to .SubmitChanges() you'll have to refactor your code a lot, so you may as well adopt the pattern of effectively keeping the datacontext global throughout your app from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the data context is &lt;em&gt;disconnected&lt;/em&gt;. The connection is only made when the query data is &lt;em&gt;enumerated&lt;/em&gt; (not when you first run the query, it's a 'lazy' data type so only provides data when it's needed), and then closed immediately afterwards. On .SubmitChanges() the connection is opened to submit the changes then closed immediately afterwards. So don't think keeping the datacontext around keeps a connection open, it doesn't (you can hook the StateChange event of the connection to confirm this for yourself, that's how I'm sure).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The operation x &amp;amp;&amp;amp; y is evaluated as T.false(x) ? x : T.&amp;amp;(x, y), where T.false(x) is an invocation of the operator false declared in T, and T.&amp;amp;(x, y) is an invocation of the selected operator &amp;amp;. In other words, x is first evaluated and operator false is invoked on the result to determine if x is definitely false. Then, if x is definitely false, the result of the operation is the value previously computed for x. Otherwise, y is evaluated, and the selected operator &amp;amp; is invoked on the value previously computed for x and the value computed for y to produce the result of the operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have abstract Parameter class, which is subclassed eventually to some concrete classes (eg: ParameterLimitedInt).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have a seperate GUI system which will be passed these parameters in a generic fashion, but the catch is that it needs to present the GUI component specific to the concrete type of the parameter class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The restrictions are that you dont want to do RTTID, and dont want to write code to handle every possible type of concrete parameter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are open to using the visitor pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With those being your requirements, here is how I would handle such a situation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would implement the visitor pattern where the accept() returns a boolean value. The base Parameter class would implement a virtual accept() function and return false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concrete implementations of the Parameter class would then contain accept() functions which will call the visitor's visit(). They would return true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visitor class would make use of a templated visit() function so you would only override for the concrete Parameter types you care to support:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Visitor
{
public:
  template&amp;lt; class T &amp;gt; void visit( const T&amp;amp; param ) const
  {
    assert( false &amp;amp;&amp;amp; "this parameter type not specialised in the visitor" );
  }
  void visit( const ParameterLimitedInt&amp;amp; ) const; // specialised implementations...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus if accept() returns false, you know the concrete type for the Parameter has not implemented the visitor pattern yet (in case there is additional logic you would prefer to handle on a case by case basis). If the assert() in the visitor pattern triggers, its because its not visiting a Parameter type which you've implemented a specialisation for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One downside to all of this is that unsupported visits are only caught at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: The JSESSIONID stuff here is
  only for older containers. Please use
  jt's currently accepted answer unless
  you are using &amp;lt; Tomcat 6.0.19 or &amp;lt; Tomcat
  5.5.28 or another container that does not support HttpOnly JSESSIONID cookies as a config option.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When setting cookies in your app, use&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;response.setHeader( "Set-Cookie", "name=value; HttpOnly");
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in many webapps, the most important cookie is the session identifier, which is automatically set by the container as the JSESSIONID cookie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you only use this cookie, you can write a ServletFilter to re-set the cookies on the way out, forcing JSESSIONID to HttpOnly. The page at &lt;strike&gt;http://keepitlocked.net/archive/2007/11/05/java-and-httponly.aspx&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;a href="http://alexsmolen.com/blog/?p=16"&gt;http://alexsmolen.com/blog/?p=16&lt;/a&gt; suggests adding the following in a filter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (response.containsHeader( "SET-COOKIE" )) {
  String sessionid = request.getSession().getId();
  response.setHeader( "SET-COOKIE", "JSESSIONID=" + sessionid 
                      + ";Path=/&amp;lt;whatever&amp;gt;; Secure; HttpOnly" );
} 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but note that this will overwrite all cookies and only set what you state here in this filter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use additional cookies to the JSESSIONID cookie, then you'll need to extend this code to set all the cookies in the filter. This is not a great solution in the case of multiple-cookies, but is a perhaps an acceptable quick-fix for the JSESSIONID-only setup. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that as your code evolves over time, there's a nasty hidden bug waiting for you when you forget about this filter and try and set another cookie somewhere else in your code. Of course, it won't get set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This really is a hack though. If you do use Tomcat and can compile it, then take a look at Shabaz's excellent suggestion to patch HttpOnly support into Tomcat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;myoldObject = new MyObject { someValue = "old value" };
cache.Insert("myObjectKey", myoldObject);
myNewObject = cache.Get("myObjectKey");
myNewObject.someValue = "new value";
if(myObject.someValue != cache.Get("myObjectKey").someValue)
     myObject.SaveToDatabase();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, essentially, I was getting an object from the cache, and then later on comparing the original object to the cached object to see if I need to save it to the database in case it's changed. The problem arose because the original object is a reference...so changing someValue also changed the referenced cached object, so it'd never save back to the database. I fixed it by cloning the object off of the cached version, severing the reference and allowing me to compare the new object against the cached one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is: &lt;strong&gt;is there a better way to do this, some pattern, that you could recommend?&lt;/strong&gt; I can't be the only person that's done this before :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I want to recover from specific problems, and I'm not sure the best way to approach it with unchecked exceptions. Here is a concrete example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose I have a web application, built using Struts2 and Hibernate. If an exception bubbles up to my "action", I log it, and display a pretty apology to the user. But one of the functions of my web application is creating new user accounts, that require a unique user name. If a user picks a name that already exists, Hibernate throws an &lt;code&gt;org.hibernate.exception.ConstraintViolationException&lt;/code&gt; (an unchecked exception) down in the guts of my system. I'd really like to recover from this particular problem by asking the user to choose another user name, rather than giving them the same "we logged your problem but for now you're hosed" message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few points to consider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There a lot of people creating accounts simultaneously. I don't want to lock the whole user table between a "SELECT" to see if the name exists and an "INSERT" if it doesn't. In the case of relational databases, there might be some tricks to work around this, but what I'm really interested in is the general case where pre-checking for an exception won't work because of a fundamental race condition. Same thing could apply to looking for a file on the file system, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given my CTO's propensity for drive-by management induced by reading technology columns in "Inc.", I need a layer of indirection around the persistence mechanism so that I can throw out Hibernate and use Kodo, or whatever, without changing anything except the lowest layer of persistence code. As a matter of fact, there are several such layers of abstraction in my system. How can I prevent them from leaking in spite of unchecked exceptions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the declaimed weaknesses of checked exceptions is having to "handle" them in every call on the stack&amp;mdash;either by declaring that a calling method throws them, or by catching them and handling them. Handling them often means wrapping them in another checked exception of a type appropriate to the level of abstraction. So, for example, in checked-exception land, a file-system&amp;ndash;based implementation of my UserRegistry might catch &lt;code&gt;IOException&lt;/code&gt;, while a database implementation would catch &lt;code&gt;SQLException&lt;/code&gt;, but both would throw a &lt;code&gt;UserNotFoundException&lt;/code&gt; that hides the underlying implementation. How do I take advantage of unchecked exceptions, sparing myself of the burden of this wrapping at each layer, without leaking implementation details?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Although this doesn't fully solve the initial problem, it will make a significant difference in the appearance of your rendered HTML diffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side-by-side rendered HTML will make it very difficult for your diff to line up vertically.  Vertical alignment is crucial for comparing side-by-side diffs.  In order to improve the vertical alignment of a side-by-side diff, you can insert invisible HTML elements in each version of the diff at "checkpoints" where the diff should be vertically aligned.  Then you can use a bit of client-side JavaScript to add vertical spacing around checkpoint until the sides line up vertically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explained in a little more detail:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to use this technique, run your diff algorithm and insert a bunch of &lt;code&gt;visibility:hidden&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s or tiny &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s wherever your side-by-side versions should match up, according to the diff.  Then run JavaScript that finds each checkpoint (and its side-by-side neighbor) and adds vertical spacing to the checkpoint that is higher-up (shallower) on the page.  Now your rendered HTML diff will be vertically aligned up to that checkpoint, and you can continue repairing vertical alignment down the rest of your side-by-side page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is the &lt;a href="http://Research.Sun.Com/projects/lively/"&gt;Lively Kernel&lt;/a&gt; by Dan Ingalls (yes, &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Dan Ingalls) at Sun Labs. It is an implementation of a Smalltalk Virtual World in JavaScript on top of SVG. More precisely, it is an implementation of the Morphic GUI framework from Squeak Smalltalk in JavaScript using SVG and a port of (parts of) Squeak Smalltalk in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, if you're not a Smalltalker and the above doesn't make sense to you: it's an Operating System, written in JavaScript with the JavaScript interpreter as the CPU, SVG as the graphics card and the browser as the computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is about as extreme as it gets, when it comes to JavaScript and SVG. And it only &lt;em&gt;fully&lt;/em&gt; works in Safari 3 and partly in Firefox 3, although there is an experimental port to Internet Explorer as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second project is John Resig's &lt;a href="http://EJohn.Org/blog/processingjs/"&gt;Processing.js&lt;/a&gt; port of the Processing visualization language to JavaScript. It uses the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;canvas&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element instead of SVG precisely because of the problems that you mentioned. This one however, only works in Firefox 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third one is &lt;a href="http://UselessPickles.Com/triangles/demo.html"&gt;Real-Time 3D in JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; by Useless Pickles. It uses &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; JavaScript, DOM and CSS and &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; SVG or &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;canvas&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or Flash or whatever. &lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt; it is portable to almost any browser, including Internet Explorer 7 and up. Doing 2D should be even easier than this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between those three projects you should be able to find some inspiration and also to find some people who tried to push the envelope with JavaScript and SVG or JavaScript and Graphics and can tell you what works and what doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: doing cross-browser SVG or cross-browser &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;canvas&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is nigh impossible, but with a little bit of craziness, cross-browser graphics &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; SVG or &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;canvas&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cdrecord has no problem burning just about any type of media you throw at it, but since it is a stand alone application, I had to do a lot of parsing to get useful information.  I can dig up the flags and different calls I used if you are interested, but unfortunately I cannot share the source as it was developed for a commercial project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While looking over the code I was also reminded that I switched form cdrecord (cdrtools) to wodim (&lt;a href="http://www.cdrkit.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;cdrkit&lt;/a&gt;).  wodim is a branch of cdrecord made a few years ago by the debian team because cdrecord dropped the GPL license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said before this was released as part of a commercial application, our interpretation of the GPL was that you can call external binaries from your program without a problem as long as your program can run without the external binaries (if cdrecord wasn't found we popped up a dialog informing the user that burning capabilities were not available) and we also had to host the source for cdrkit and cygwin and include a copy of the GPL with our distributed program.  So basically we would not make "derivative works", we would compile the cdrkit code exactly as it was, and then use the produced binaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as StarBurn SDK, I demoed it, but I didn't use it for a shipped product so I can't really give a recommendation or say much more than it does work&lt;/p&gt;

When you get an object from the cache, the cache returns a clone of the object instead of the stored object (again so that the caller can mutate the object without effecting the cached/canonical object).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes things harder, not easier, because there are seemingly so many ways of accomplishing both of the goals (modularity, platform agnosticism). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My basic premise is that security, data storage, interaction with the operating system, and configuration should all be handled by a "container" application - but most of the other functionality will be supplied through plug-in modules.  If I had to describe it at a high level (without completely giving away my idea), it would be a single application that can do many different jobs, all dedicated to the same goal (there are lots of disparate things to do, but all the data has to interact and be highly available).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a new idea, and not particularly exotic.  Yet I find myself wrestling with not so much how to do it (I can think of lots of ways), but which method is best.&lt;/p&gt;

I suppose that's fine in the sense that &lt;em&gt;self&lt;/em&gt; is a local variable in the &lt;em&gt;add&lt;/em&gt; method of the class, but this is preventing me from modifying the initial value assigned to the instance of the class.&lt;/p&gt;

I work on a data-driven application where each data unit is tiny, but we may have upwards of a billion data units at any given time.  The method we use is basically:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything resides on disk, no matter what&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data is blocked into "chunks"; each chunk knows when it was last accessed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chunks are dragged up from disk into memory when they are needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A low-priority thread monitors memory usage and deletes the least recently used stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, it's a homebrew caching scheme.  The benefit is you can control with pinpoint accuracy what data is in memory, which you cannot if you rely on the OS paging scheme.  If some commonly used variable ends up mixed in with your data on a page, that page will be repeatedly hit and prevent it from going to disk.  If you design into your application an accommodation that some data requests will take longer than others, then this will work pretty well.  Particularly if you know what chunks you will need ahead of time (we don't).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that everything in a .NET app has to fit within 2 GB of memory, and because of the way the GC works and the overhead of you app, you actually probably have somewhat less than that to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

Either mechanism can be used to indicate a programming error, not a runtime error, as is the case here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assertions have the advantage of performance as they are typically disabled on production systems.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exceptions have the advantage of safety, as the check is always performed.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choice really depends on the development practices of the project.  The project as a whole needs to decide on an assertion policy: if the choice is to enable assertions during all development, then I'd say to use assertions to check this kind of invalid parameter - in a production system, a NullPointerException thrown due to a programming error is unlikely to be able to be caught and handled in a meaningful way anyway and so will act just like an assertion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practically though, I know a lot of developers that don't trust that assertions will be enabled when appropriate and so opt for the safety of throwing a NullPointerException.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course if you can't enforce a policy for your code (if you're creating a library, for example, and so are dependent on how other developers run your code), you should opt for the safe approach of throwing NullPointerException for those methods that are part of the library's API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) It encourages you to think about the failure modes for the code you write. Basically, you have to consider the exceptions that the code you call may throw, and in turn you'll consider the exceptions you'll throw for the code that calls yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) It gives you the opportunity to add additional debugging information into the exception chain. For instance, if you have a method that throws an exception on a duplicate username, you might wrap that exception with one that includes additional information about the circumstances of the failure (for example, the IP of the request that provided the dupe username) that wasn't available to the lower-level code. The cookie trail of exceptions may help you debug a complex problem (it certainly has for me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) It lets you become implementation-independent from the lower level code. If you're wrapping exceptions and need to swap out Hibernate for some other ORM, you only have to change your Hibernate-handling code. All the other layers of code will still be successfully using the wrapped exceptions and will interpret them in the same way, even though the underlying circumstances have changed. Note that this applies even if Hibernate changes in some way (ex: they switch exceptions in a new version); it's not just for wholesale technology replacement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) It encourages you use different classes of exceptions to represent different situations. For example, you may have a DuplicateUsernameException when the user tries to reuse a username, and a DatabaseFailureException when you can't check for dupe usernames due to a broken DB connection. This, in turn, lets you answer your question ("how do I recover?") in flexible and powerful ways. If you get a DuplicateUsernameException, you may decide to suggest a different username to the user. If you get a DatabaseFailureException, you may let it bubble up to the point where it displays a "down for maintenance" page to the user and send off a notification email to you. Once you have custom exceptions, you have customizeable responses -- and that's a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

That way, if the IP changes, but you still have the cookie, you're identified and logged in, and if the cookie is absent but you have the same IP address as the one save on the server, then they set your cookie to the id paired with that IP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really, it's that second possibility that is tricky to get right. If the cookie is missing, and you only have your IP address to show for identification, it's quite unsafe to log someone in just based of that. So servers probably store additional info about you, LSO seem like a good choice, geo IP too, but User Agent, not so much because they don't really say anything about you, every body using the same version of the same browser as you has the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, it has been mentioned above that it could work with MAC adresses. &lt;strong&gt;I strongly disagree!&lt;/strong&gt; Your MAC address never reaches your bank's server, as they are only used to identify sides of an Ethernet connection, and to connect to your bank you make a bunch of Ethernet connections: from your computer to your home router, or your ISP, then from there to the first internet router you go through, then to the second, etc... and each time a new connection is made, each machine on each side provide their very own MAC addresses. So your MAC address can only be known to the machines directly connected to you through a switch or hub, because anything else that routes your packets will replace your MAC with their own. Only the IP address stays the same all the way.
If MAC addresses did go all the way, it would be a privacy nightmare, as all MAC addresses are unique to a single device, hence to a single person.&lt;/p&gt;

Both are mainly implementations of a set of several design patterns focused on modularity and loose coupling between components similar to a plug-in architecture: you have an IOC framework, MVC base classes, a loosely coupled event broker, dynamic loading of modules and other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I suppose that kind of pattern infrastructure is what you are trying to find, just not specifically for .NET. But if you see the CAB as a set of pattern implementations, you can see that almost every language and platform has some form of already built-in or third party frameworks for individual patterns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my take would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study (if you are not familiar with) some of those design patterns. You could take as an example the CAB framework for WPF documentation: &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc707841.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;Patterns in the Composite Application Library&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design your architecture thinking on which of those patterns you think would be useful for what you want to achieve &lt;b&gt;first without thinking in specific pattern implementations or products&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you have your 'architectural requirements' defined more specifically, look for individual frameworks that help accomplish each one of those patterns/features for the language you decide to use and put together your own application framework based on them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree that the hard part is to make all this platform independent. I really cannot think on any other solution to choose a mature platform independent language like Java.&lt;/p&gt;

There are definately some interesting points you make there. The example I posted is somewhat trivial but the basis of the question came from using NHibernate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With NHibernate, you can write a clause like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int[] employeeIds = new int[]{1, 5, 23463, 32523};
NHibernateSession.CreateCriteria(typeof(Employee))
.Add(Restrictions.InG("EmployeeId",employeeIds))

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I doubt that .NET would be much faster than Java (they're both VM languages after all), but the big problem with .NET is platform independence. Mono has a noble goal and surprisingly good results so far but it will &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; be playing catch-up with Microsoft on Windows. You might be able to accept its limitations but it's still not the same as having identical multiplatform environments that Java, Python, and Ruby have. Also: the .NET development and support tools are heavily skewed towards Windows, and probably always will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMO, your best bet is to target Java... or, at the very least, the JVM. If you don't like the Java language (and as a C# dev I'm guessing that's not the case) then you at least have options like Jython, JRuby, and Scala. With the JVM, you get very good platform independence, good performance, and access to a huge number of libraries and support tools. There's almost always a Java library, port or implementation that will do what you need it to do. I don't think any other platform out there has the same number of options; there's real value in that flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for modularity: that's more about how you build the software than what platform you use. I don't know much about plugin architectures like you describe but I'm guessing that it will be possible in pretty much any modern platform you pick.&lt;/p&gt;

My solution was to override the &lt;code&gt;myPieChart.dataTipFunction&lt;/code&gt;. For data that looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;myPieChart.dataProvider =
  [ { category: "Groceries", cost: 50 },
    { category: "Transportation", cost: 175} ]
myPieChart.dataField = "cost";
myPieChart.categoryField = "category";
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a function like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import com.yahoo.astra.fl.charts.series.*
myPieChart.dataTipFunction = 
  function (obj:Object, index:int, series:ISeries):String {
    return obj.category + "\n$" + obj.cost;
  };
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's ceil(2.718281828459045) problems with this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm directly calling the category and cost properties of the data provider. The names are actually configurable when setting up the chart, I'd like to maintain that flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The default data tip would show the category, the cost (without a dollar sign), and the percentage it makes up in the pie chart. So here, I've lost the percentage. I just have no idea which property of what would hold that. It might be part of the series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I probably only need to override the &lt;code&gt;dataItemRenderer&lt;/code&gt; for the cost part of the series, but I don't know how to access it.  The documentation is a little ... lacking there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally I would just look at the default implementation of the &lt;code&gt;dataTipFunction&lt;/code&gt; but it's all inside a compiled shm that's part of the components distributed from yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can anyone help me complete this overridden function with percentage information and the flexibility mentioned in point 1?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the mythical "somebody" can replace the implementation of MD5 with something insecure. But in order to do that, the mythical somebody must actually be able to get his code into the Ruby process. And if he can do that, then he presumably could also inject his code into a Java process and e.g. rewrite the bytecode for the MD5 operation. Or just intercept the keypresses and not actually bother with fiddling with the cryptography code at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the typical concerns is: I'm writing this awesome library, which is supposed to be used like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;require 'awesome'
# Do something awesome.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if someone uses it like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;require 'evil_cracker_lib_from_russian_pr0n_site'
# Overrides crypto functions and sends all data to mafia
require 'awesome'
# Now everything is insecure because awesome lib uses 
# cracker lib instead of builtin
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the simple solution is: don't do that! Educate your users that they shouldn't run untrusted code they downloaded from obscure sources in their security critical applications. And if they do, they probably deserve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To come back to your Java example: it's true that in Java you can make your crypto code &lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;final&lt;/code&gt; and what not. However, someone can &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; replace your crypto implementation! In fact, someone actually did: many open-source Java implementations use OpenSSL to implement their cryptographic routines. And, as you probably know, Debian shipped with a broken, insecure version of OpenSSL for years. So, all Java programs running on Debian for the past couple of years actually &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; run with insecure crypto!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was about to approach a project that needed to marshal structured data across the C++/C# boundary, but I found what could be a better way (especially if you know C++ and like learning new programming languages). If you have access to Visual Studio 2005 or above you might consider using C++/CLI rather than marshaling. It basically allows you to create this magic hybrid .NET/native class library that's 100% compatible with C# (as if you had written everything in C#, for the purposes of consuming it in another C# project) that is also 100% compatible with C and/or C++. In your case you could write a C++/CLI wrapper that marshaled the data from C++ in memory to CLI in memory types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've had pretty good luck with this, using pure C++ code to read and write out datafiles (this could be a third party library of some kind, even), and then my C++/CLI code converts (copies) the C++ data into .NET types, in memory, which can be consumed directly as if I had written the read/write library in C#. For me the only barrier was syntax, since you have to learn the CLI extensions to C++. I wish I'd had StackOverflow to ask syntax questions, back when I was learning this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In return for trudging through the syntax, you learn probably the most powerful programming language imaginable. Think about it: the elegance and sanity of C# and the .NET libraries, and the low level and native library compatibility of C++. You wouldn't want to write all your projects in C++/CLI but it's great for getting C++ data into C#/.NET projects. It "just works."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a potentially serious problem with this code, because it ignores the character encoding specified in the &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; (which is UTF-8 by default). When you call &lt;code&gt;String.getBytes()&lt;/code&gt; the platform default encoding is used to encode Unicode characters to bytes. So, the parser may think it's getting UTF-8 data when in fact it's getting EBCDIC or something&amp;hellip; not pretty!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, use the parse method that takes an InputSource, which can be constructed with a Reader, like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import java.io.StringReader;
import org.xml.sax.InputSource;

        return builder.parse(new InputSource(new StringReader(xml)));

&lt;p&gt;Maps are either stored on the device or received over a connection. Navigation is computed based on those maps' databases. These likely are a licensed item with a cost associated, though if you use a service like Google Maps they have the license with NAVTEQ and others.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Java provides lots of other tools for defensive programming&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially I thought you were talking about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_programming#Some_Defensive_programming_techniques" rel="nofollow"&gt;normal defensive programming&lt;/a&gt;, 
wherein the idea is to defend the program (or your subset of it, or your single function) from invalid data input.&lt;br /&gt;
That's a great thing, and I encourage everyone to go read that article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However it seems you are actually talking about "defending your code from other programmers."  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, this is a completely pointless goal, as no matter what you do, a malicious programmer can always run your program under a debugger, or use &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_injection" rel="nofollow"&gt;dll injection&lt;/a&gt; or any number of other techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are merely seeking to protect your code from incompetent co-workers, this is ridiculous. &lt;strong&gt;Educate your co-workers, or get better co-workers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At any rate, if such things are of great concern to you, ruby is not the programming language for you. Monkeypatching is in there by design, and to disallow it goes against the whole point of the feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in your action/controller you can have a try-catch block around the logic where the Hibernate call is made. Depending on the exception you can render specific error messages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I guess in your today it could be Hibernate, and tomorrow SleepLongerDuringWinter framework. In this case you need to pretend to have your own little ORM framework that wraps around the third party framework.

&lt;p&gt;I don't see how throwing a .net framework exception is going to help him :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, in a Java way, assuming the null comes from a programming error (ie. should never go outside the testing phase), then leave the system throw it, or if there are side-effects reaching that point, check for null at the beginning and throw either IllegalArgumentException or NullPointerException.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the null could come from an actual &lt;em&gt;exception&lt;/em&gt;al case but you don't want to use a checked exception for that, then you definitely want to go the IllegalArgumentException route at the beginning of the method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic situation is that these switches can be defined anywhere in code, you just need to create a new System.Diagnostics.BooleanSwitch with the name given and the config file can control them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular one is defined in System.ComponentModel.CompModSwitches.DisableRemoteDebugging:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public static BooleanSwitch DisableRemoteDebugging
{
    get
    {
        if (disableRemoteDebugging == null)
        {
            disableRemoteDebugging = new BooleanSwitch("Remote.Disable", "Disable remote debugging for web methods.");
        }
        return disableRemoteDebugging;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your case it's probably being called from &lt;em&gt;System.Web.Services.Protocols.RemoteDebugger.IsClientCallOutEnabled()&lt;/em&gt;, which is being called by &lt;em&gt;System.Web.Services.Protocols.WebClientProtocol.NotifyClientCallOut&lt;/em&gt; which is in turn being called by the Invoke method of &lt;em&gt;System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapHttpClientProtocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, to my knowledge, short of decompiling the framework &amp;amp; seaching for &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;new BooleanSwitch
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or any of the other inheritors of the &lt;em&gt;System.Diagnostics.Switch&lt;/em&gt; class,
there's no easy way to know what switches are defined.  It seems to be a case of searching msdn/google/stack overflow for the specific case&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case I just used Reflector &amp;amp; searched for the Remote.Disable string&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to cast/convert all of this data into the appropriate data types (ie int, decimal, nvarchar, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I was going to do this was to iterate through all records using a while loop and attempt a CAST on each column on a single record during each iteration, after I visit a particular record I flag it as processed (bit field).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;: I am using a SSIS package to populate the staging table. I see that now I must revisit that package and implement a script component to handle the conversions. Thanks guys&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The standard citrix homepage (or how we use it) is a simple web page with program icons. Click on it, and the application get's delivered to you. People want the same thing, at work, with their applications/folders/documents. And because I'm a web developer, and they asked me, I do it with a web page... Perhaps I should pass the whole thing over to the VB guy..&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahh... I know of 2 ways to accomplish this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can embed internet explorer into an application, and hook into it and intercept certain kinds of URL's and so on&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw this done a few years ago - a telephony application embedded internet explorer in itself, and loaded some specially formatted webpages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the webpage there was this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a href="dial#1800-234-567"&amp;gt;Call John Smith&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally this would be a broken URL, but when the user clicked on this link, the application containing the embedded IE got notified, and proceeded to execute it's own custom code to dial the number from the URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could get your VB guy to write an application which basically just wraps IE, and has handlers for executing applications. You could then code normal webpages with links to just open applications, and the VB app would launch them. This allows you to write your own security stuff (like, only launch applications in a preset list, or so on) into the VB app, and because VB is launching them, not IE, none of the IE security issues will be involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second way is with browser plug-ins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, skype comes with a Firefox plug-in, which looks for phone-numbers in web-pages, and attaches special links to them. When you click on these links it invokes skype - you could conceivably do something similar for launching your citrix apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'd then be tied to firefox though. Writing plugins for IE is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; harder than for FF, I wouldn't go down that path unless forced to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;a user will log out, but won't be able to log back in until the logout reaches the cache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the app/box crashes without a chance for the user to log out, the user's state in the database will remain "logged in".&lt;/li&gt;

You build models and the when you run a syncdb it applies the models that you have created. If you add a model you just need to run syncdb again. This would be easy to have your build script do every time you made a push. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem comes when you need to alter a table that is already made. I do not think that syncdb handles that. That would require you to go in and manually add the table and also add a property to the model. You would probably want to version that alter statement. The models would always be under version control though, so if you needed to you could get a db schema up and running on a new box without running the sql scripts. Another problem with this is keeping track of static data that you always want in the db.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rails migration scripts are pretty nice too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A DB versioning system would be great, but I don't really know of such a thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, GPS on cell phones is a bit more murky.  In general, it won't cost you anything to turn on the GPS in your cell phone, but when you get a location it usually involves the cell phone company in order to get it quickly with little signal, as well as get a location when the satellites aren't visible (since the gov't requires a fix even if the satellites aren't visible for emergency 911 purposes).  It uses up some cellular bandwidth.  This also means that for phones without a regular GPS receiver, you cannot use the GPS at all if you don't have cell phone service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason most cell phone companies have the GPS in the phone turned off except for emergency calls and for services they sell you (such as directions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular kind of GPS is called assisted GPS (AGPS), and there are several levels of assistance used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;GPS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A normal GPS receiver listens to a particular frequency for radio signals.  Satellites send time coded messages at this frequency.  Each satellite has an atomic clock, and sends the current exact time as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GPS receiver figures out which satellites it can hear, and then starts gathering those messages.  The messages include time, current satellite positions, and a few other bits of information.  The message stream is slow - this is to save power, and also because all the satellites transmit on the same frequency and they're easier to pick out if they go slow.  Because of this, and the amount of information needed to operate well, it can take 30-60 seconds to get a location on a regular GPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it knows the position and time code of at least 3 satellites, a GPS receiver can assume it's on the earth's surface and get a good reading.  4 satellites are needed if you aren't on the ground and you want altitude as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;AGPS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you saw above, it can take a long time to get a position fix with a normal GPS.  There are ways to speed this up, but unless you're carrying an atomic clock with you all the time, or leave the GPS on all the time, then there's always going to be a delay of between 5-60 seconds before you get a location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to save cost, most cell phones share the GPS receiver components with the cellular components, and you can't get a fix and talk at the same time.  People don't like that (especially when there's an emergency) so the lowest form of GPS does the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get some information from the cell phone company to feed to the GPS receiver - some of this is gross positioning information based on what cellular towers can 'hear' your phone, so by this time they already phone your location to within a city block or so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch from cellular to GPS receiver for 0.1 second (or some small, practically unoticable period of time) and collect the raw GPS data (no processing on the phone).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch back to the phone mode, and send the raw data to the phone company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The phone company processes that data (acts as an offline GPS receiver) and send the location back to your phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This saves a lot of money on the phone design, but it has a heavy load on cellular bandwidth, and with a lot of requests coming it requires a lot of fast servers.  Still, overall it can be cheaper and faster to implement.  They are reluctant, however, to release GPS based features on these phones due to this load - so you won't see turn by turn navigation here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recent designs include a full GPS chip.  They still get data from the phone company - such as current location based on tower positioning, and current satellite locations - this provides sub 1 second fix times.  This information is only needed once, and the GPS can keep track of everything after that with very little power.  If the cellular network is unavailable, then they can still get a fix after awhile.  If the GPS satellites aren't visible to the receiver, then they can still get a rough fix from the cellular towers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to completely answer your question - it's as free as the phone company lets it be, and so far they do not charge for it at all.  I doubt that's going to change in the future.  In the higher end phones with a full GPS receiver you may even be able to load your own software and access it, such as with mologogo on a motorola iDen phone - the J2ME development kit is free, and the phone is only $40 (prepaid phone with $5 credit).  Unlimited internet is about $10 a month, so for $40 to start and $10 a month you can get an internet tracking system. (Prices circa August 2008)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's only going to get cheaper and more full featured from here on out...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Re: Google maps and such&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, Google maps and all other cell phone mapping systems require a data connection of some sort at varying times during usage.  When you move far enough in one direction, for instance, it'll request new tiles from its server.  Your average phone doesn't have enough storage to hold a map of the US, nor the processor power to render it nicely. iPhone would be able to if you wanted to use the storage space up with maps, but given that most iPhones have a full time unlimited data plan most users would rather use that space for other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As was already explained, the main difference is &lt;em&gt;type erasure&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. the fact that the Java compiler erases the generic types and they don't end up in the generated bytecode. However, the question is: why would anyone do that? It doesn't make sense! Or does it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, what's the alternative? If you don't implement generics in the language, where &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; you implement them? And the answer is: in the Virtual Machine. Which breaks backwards compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Type erasure, on the other hand, allows you to mix generic clients with non-generic libraries. In other words: code that was compiled on Java 5 can still be deployed to Java 1.4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, however, decided to break backwards compatibility for generics. &lt;em&gt;That's&lt;/em&gt; why .NET Generics are "better" than Java Generics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Sun aren't idiots or cowards. The reason why they "chickened out", was that Java was significantly older and more widespread than .NET when they introduced generics. (They were introduced roughly at the same time in both worlds.) Breaking backwards compatibility would have been a huge pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put yet another way: in Java, Generics are a part of the &lt;em&gt;Language&lt;/em&gt; (which means they apply &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; to Java, not to other languages), in .NET they are part of the &lt;em&gt;Virtual Machine&lt;/em&gt; (which means they apply to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; languages, not just C# and Visual Basic.NET).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare this with .NET features like LINQ, lambda expressions, local variable type inference, anonymous types and expression trees: these are all &lt;em&gt;language&lt;/em&gt; features. That's why there are subtle differences between VB.NET and C#: if those features were part of the VM, they would be the same in &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; languages. But the CLR hasn't changed: it's still the same in .NET 3.5 SP1 as it was in .NET 2.0. You can compile a C# program that uses LINQ with the .NET 3.5 compiler and still run it on .NET 2.0, provided that you don't use any .NET 3.5 libraries. That would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; work with generics and .NET 1.1, but it &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; work with Java and Java 1.4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sample I came up with is essentially something like:&lt;/p&gt;

There suggestion in reality turns out to be three times larger than the one I suggested. I searched for the mysterious "Industry Standard" that was mentioned but the closest I could find was the XML attributes should only be used for meta data, but said the debate was about what was actually meta data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the long winded explanation (sorry) how do you determine what is meta data, and when designing the structure of an XML document how should you decide when to use an attribute or an element?&lt;/p&gt;

For your part, you are right in that it's sometimes hard to decide where the line between meta-data and data is when modeling your domain in XML. In practice, what I do is pretend that anything in the markup is hidden, and only the data outside the markup is readable. Does the document make some sense in that way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;XML is notoriously bulky. For transport and storage, compression is highly recommended if you can afford the processing power. XML compresses well, sometimes phenomenally well, because of its repetitiveness. I've had large files compress to less than 5% of their original size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another point to bolster your position is that while the other team is arguing about style (in that most XML tools will handle an all-attribute document just as easily as an all-#PCDATA document) you are arguing practicalities. While style can't be totally ignored, technical merits should carry more weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the client is trying to connect over TCP/IP, it doesn't matter whether or not the Windows machine has the Novell client installed&lt;/li&gt;

A lot of it depends on what kind of application you have, and what OS it is running on.  A couple of these tips will certainly go a long way to jazzing things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensure adequate spacing between controls  don't cram them all together.  Space is appealing. You might also trying flowing the controls a little differently when you have more space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put in some new 3D and glossy images. You can put a big yellow exclamation mark on a custom warning dialog. Replace old toolbar buttons with new ones. Two libraries I have used and like are &lt;a href="http://www.glyfx.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;GlyFX&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.iconexperience.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;IconExperience&lt;/a&gt;. You can find free ones too. Ideally get a graphic artist to make some custom ones for the specific actions your application does to fill in between the common ones you use (make sure they all go together). That will go a long way to making it look fancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try a different font. Tahoma is a good one. Often times the default font is MS Sans Serif. You can do better. Avoid Times New Roman and Comic Sans though. Also avoid large blocks of bold  use it sparingly. Generally you want all your fonts the same, and only use different fonts sparingly to set certain bits of text apart.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add subdued colors to certain controls. This is a tricky one. You always want to use subdued colors, nothing bright or stark usually, but the colors should indicate something, or if you have a grid you can use it to show logical grouping. This is a slippery slope. Be aware that users might change their system colors, which will change how your colors look.  Ideally give them a few color themes, or the ability to change colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of thinking eye-candy, think usability. Make the most common course of action obvious. Mark Miller of DevExpress has a great talk on the Science of User Interface Design. I actually have a video of it and might be able to post it online with a little clean-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invest in a few good quality 3rd party controls.  Replacing all your controls could be a pain, but if you are using the default grids for example, you would really jazz it up with a good grid from &lt;a href="http://www.devexpress.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;DevExpress&lt;/a&gt; or some other component vendor.  Be aware that different vendors have different philosophies for how their components are used, so swapping them out can be a bit of a pain.  Start small to test the waters, and then try something really complicated before you commit to replacing all of them.  The only thing worse then ugly grids is ugly grids mixed with pretty grids. Consistency is golden!  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You also might look at replacing your old tool bars and menus with a Ribbon Control like Microsoft did in Office 2007.  Then everyone will think you are really uptown!  Again only replacing key components and UI elements without thinking you need to revamp the whole UI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course pay attention to the basics like tab order, etc. Consistency, consistency, consistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some apps lend themselves to full blown skinning, while others don't. Generally you don't want anything flashy that gets used a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xcode 3.0 templates can be found in [Dev Installation]/Library/Xcode/, likely /Developer/Library/Xcode. If you want to modify these templates or add your own, use the following directories to save your new/modified templates so that they are not wiped out by future Developer Tool upgrades:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File templates:
~/Library/Developer/Shared/Xcode/File
Templates/ &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Target templates:
~/Library/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Target
Templates/ &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project templates:
~/Library/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Project
Templates/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that you can also use the /Library/Developer/Shared/Xcode/[File|Target|Project] Templates/ directory for templates shared by all users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you just want to change the &lt;strong&gt;MyCompanyName&lt;/strong&gt; in the templates, the following command line will do the trick:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;defaults write com.apple.Xcode PBXCustomTemplateMacroDefinitions '{ "ORGANIZATIONNAME" = "NewCompanyName";}'

&lt;p&gt;It's trivial to create new snippets that can accomplish a lot using replacements, tabbing order, and regex substitutions. Quickly assigning these to the tab key for specific languages makes me more productive. And makes me worry about code bloat. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a bitwise operation in an if expression would serve the same criticism, though perhaps not by the compiler.  Any non-zero value is considered true, so something like "if (7 &amp;amp; 3)" will be true.  This behavior may be acceptable in Perl, but C/C++ are very explicit languages.  I think the Spock eyebrow is due diligence. :)  I would append "== 0" or "!= 0" to make it perfectly clear what your objective was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But anyway, it sounds like a personal preference.  I would run the code through lint or similar tool and see if it also thinks it's an unwise strategy.  Personally, it reads like a coding mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be two types of course:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tag elements that are immediately closed, e.g., &amp;lt; br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tag elements that need a separate closing tag, e.g., &amp;lt; p &gt; text &amp;lt; /p &gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With some styling I have an image that is split between the column and the content but needs to maintain the same vertical positioning so that it lines up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Styling is similar to this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#column 
{
    width:150px;
    height:450px;
    left:-150px;
    bottom:-140px;
    background:url(../images/image.png) no-repeat;
    position:absolute;
    z-index:1;
}

#container 
{
   background:transparent url(../images/container.png) no-repeat scroll left bottom;
   position:relative;
   width:100px;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works great when content in #content is dynamically loaded before rendering.  This also works great in firefox always.  However, in IE6 and IE7 if I use javascript to change the content (and thus height) of #content, the images no longer line up (#column doesn't move). If I use IE Developer Bar to just update the div (say add position:absolute manually) the image jumps down and lines up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there something I am missing here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Ricky - Hmm, that means in this case there is no solution I think.  At its best there will be a jaggedy matchup afterwards but as my content expands and contracts etc. hiding/showing doesn't work out to be practical.  Still thanks for answering with the best solution.&lt;/p&gt;

Encrypted disk images that you can use for this are &lt;em&gt;trivial&lt;/em&gt; to create using Disk Utility, and can use strong cryptography.

It gives me the B-DB storage goodness, but I get to use it from a document-centric perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

This update happens whenever an associated select tag receives an onchange event.  The problem is, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;select onchange="this.form.submit();"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;; doesn't work.  Nor does &lt;code&gt;document.forms[0].submit()&lt;/code&gt;.  The only way to get the onsubmit code generated in the form_remote_tag to execute is to create a hidden submit button, and invoke the click method on the button from the select tag.  Here's a working ERb partial example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;% form_remote_tag :url =&amp;gt; product_path, :update =&amp;gt; 'content', :method =&amp;gt; 'get' do -%&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;% content_tag :div, :id =&amp;gt; 'content' do -%&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;%= select_tag :update, options_for_select([["foo", 1], ["bar", 2]]), :onchange =&amp;gt; "this.form.commit.click" %&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;%= submit_tag 'submit_button', :style =&amp;gt; "display: none" %&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;% end %&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;% end %&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I want to do is something like this, but it doesn't work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;% form_remote_tag :url =&amp;gt; product_path, :update =&amp;gt; 'content', :method =&amp;gt; 'get' do -%&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;% content_tag :div, :id =&amp;gt; 'content' do -%&amp;gt;
    # the following line does not work
    &amp;lt;%= select_tag :update, options_for_select([["foo", 1], ["bar", 2]]), :onchange =&amp;gt; "this.form.onsubmit()" %&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;% end %&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;% end %&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, is there any way to remove the invisible submit button for this use case?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be some confusion.  So, let me explain.  The basic problem is that &lt;code&gt;submit()&lt;/code&gt; doesn't call the &lt;code&gt;onsubmit()&lt;/code&gt; code rendered into the form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual HTML form that Rails renders from this ERb looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;form action="/products/1" method="post" onsubmit="new Ajax.Updater('content', '/products/1', {asynchronous:true, evalScripts:true, method:'get', parameters:Form.serialize(this)}); return false;"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;div style="margin:0;padding:0"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;input name="authenticity_token" type="hidden" value="4eacf78eb87e9262a0b631a8a6e417e9a5957cab" /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;div id="content"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;select id="update" name="update" onchange="this.form.commit.click"&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;option value="1"&amp;gt;foo&amp;lt;/option&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;option value="2"&amp;gt;bar&amp;lt;/option&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/select&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;input name="commit" style="display: none" type="submit" value="submit_button" /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to axe the invisible submit button, but using a straight form.submit appears to not work.  So, I need some way to call the form's onsubmit event code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: Orion Edwards solution would work if there wasn't a &lt;code&gt;return(false);&lt;/code&gt; generated by Rails.  I'm not sure which is worse though, sending a phantom click to an invisible submit button or calling eval on the &lt;code&gt;getAttribute('onsubmit')&lt;/code&gt; call after removing the return call with a javascript string replacement!   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I think this is a dangerous way of solving your original problem of database sproc versioning. If you are going to change the signature of a procedure by adding or removing parameters, you should do one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code in a backwards-compatible manner by using defaults (for new params) or by simply ignoring a param (for deleted params). This ensures that your client code can always call any version of your stored procedure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explicitly version the procedure by name (so you will have my_proc and my_proc_v2). This ensures that your client code and sprocs stay in sync.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relying on DeriveParameters to validate what version of the sproc you're using seems like the wrong tool for the job, IMHO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the bare minimum you're looking at probably half a second by the time it builds the XML, sends the HTTP request to the remote server, which then has to parse the XML and send a response back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whichever application did the &lt;code&gt;INSERT INTO BLAH&lt;/code&gt; query which caused the web-service to fire is going to have to wait for it to finish.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The web service-invoking code runs inside SQL server, and uses up it's resources. As it's going to take a long time to wait for the HTTP request, you'll end up using up a lot of resources, which will again hurt the performance of your server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do that you'd have to get the font metrics for each character, and apply them to all your letters in your string. While you could do this by using a drawing/rendering library like ImageMagick on the server, it wouldn't really work because different browser on different OS's render fonts differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if it did work, you wouldn't want to do it, because it would also take forever to render. Your server would be able to push 1 page per second (if that) instead of several thousand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can live without the trailing ..., then you can nicely fake it using &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; tags and css &lt;code&gt;overflow: hidden&lt;/code&gt;, like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.line_of_text {

&lt;p&gt;Your solution is a RAM drive.  Copy the files you need to edit there using whatever method you prefer (I would suggest source control) and then you can edit them without lag.  When you are done commit them back to the server.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As was pointed out your editor may be caching changes to your temp directory, or maybe even your swap file (if it is in memory, then it can get swapped out).  The solution to that is get a much larger RAM drive and run a Virtual Machine in the RAM drive.  Not sure what OS you are running, but you can get a pretty slim install of most OS's if all you are doing is editing source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't have enough RAM, then get a Gigabyte i-RAM solid state drive and remove the battery, that way it will loose everything when you power down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set your VMWare to not allow the OS to swap any of the virtual machine.  Keep a baseline VM on your hard drive and copy it to your RAM drive before booting it up.  Then you can use the hard drive in the VM like a hard drive, even though it is RAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Might be a good idea to run a secure erase on your RAM drive before powering down.  Also keep in mind that they have found if you super cool a RAM chip before removing it from a functioning computer, and place it in a new computer quick enough, the data may still be intact.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess it all comes down to how detailed that policy is, and how it is interpreted.  &lt;/p&gt;

&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div class="sidebox"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class="qrytxt"&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;span class="ellipsis"&amp;gt;&amp;amp;hellip;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one flaw with this, if the text is short enough to be fully displayed, the ellipses will still be displayed as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[EDIT: 6/26/2009]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the suggestion of Power-Coder I have revised this a little. There are really only two changes, the addition of the doctype (see notes below) and the addition of the "display: inline-block" attribute on the qrytxt div.  Here is what it looks like now...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;style&amp;gt;
        div.sidebox 
        {
            width: 25%;
        }

        div.sidebox div.qrytxt
        {
            height: 1em;
            line-height: 1em;
            overflow: hidden;
            display: inline-block;
        }

        div.sidebox div.qrytxt span.ellipsis
        {
            float: right;
        }
&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class="sidebox"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;div class="qrytxt"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;span class="ellipsis"&amp;gt;&amp;amp;hellip;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
            Some long text which will arbitrarily be cut off at whatever word fits best but will have an ellipsis at the end.
        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

        &amp;lt;div class="qrytxt"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;span class="ellipsis"&amp;gt;&amp;amp;hellip;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
            Some more long text which will arbitrarily be cut off at whatever word fits best but will have an ellipsis at the end.
        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

        &amp;lt;div class="qrytxt"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;span class="ellipsis"&amp;gt;&amp;amp;hellip;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
            Short text. FTW
        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viewed in IE 8.0, Opera 9, FF 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A doctype is required for IE to get the "display: inline-block" to work correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the qrytxt div's overflow occurs on a long word, there is going to be a wide gap between the ellipsis and the last visible word.  You can see this by viewing the example and resizing your browser width in small increments. (this probably existed in the original example as well, I just may have not noticed it then)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So again, an imperfect CSS-only solution.  Javascript may be the only thing that can get the effect perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[EDIT: 6/27/2009]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is another alternative which uses browser specific extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;style&amp;gt;
     div.sidebox 
     {
      width: 26%;
     }

     div.sidebox div.qrytxt
     {
      height: 1em;
      line-height: 1em;
      overflow: hidden;
      text-overflow:ellipsis;
      -o-text-overflow:ellipsis;
      -ms-text-overflow:ellipsis;
      -moz-binding:url(ellipsis-xbl.xml#ellipsis);
      white-space:nowrap;
     }
    &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class="sidebox"&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;div class="qrytxt"&amp;gt;
      Some long text which will arbitrarily be cut off at whatever word fits best but will have an ellipsis at the end.
     &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

     &amp;lt;div class="qrytxt"&amp;gt;
      Some more long text which will arbitrarily be cut off at whatever word fits best but will have an ellipsis at the end.
     &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

     &amp;lt;div class="qrytxt"&amp;gt;
      Short text. FTW
     &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that in order for the above example to work, you must create the xml file referenced by the -moz-binding rule, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ellipsis-xbl.xml&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It's should contain the following xml:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;bindings xmlns="http://www.mozilla.org/xbl" xmlns:xbl="http://www.mozilla.org/xbl" xmlns:xul="http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;binding id="ellipsis"&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;content&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;xul:window&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;xul:description crop="end" xbl:inherits="value=xbl:text"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;children/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/xul:description&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/xul:window&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/content&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/binding&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/bindings&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically in recursion you have a &lt;em&gt;base-case&lt;/em&gt; which is what stops the recursive calls and begins popping the call stack.  To use a classic example, though more C-ish than Lisp, the factorial function illustrates tail recursion.  The recursive call occurs &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; checking the base-case condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;factorial(x, fac) {
  if (x == 1)
     return fac;
   else
     return factorial(x-1, x*fac);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note, the initial call to factorial must be factorial(n, 1) where n is the number for which the factorial is to be calculated.&lt;/p&gt;

In this manner, you don't get the result of your calculation until you have returned from every recursive call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In tail recursion, you perform your calculations first, and then you execute the recursive call, passing the results of your current step to the next recursive step. This results in the last statement being in the form of "(return (recursive-function params))" (I think that's the syntax for Lisp). Basically, the return value of any given recursive step is the same as the return value of the next recursive call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequence of this is that once you are ready to perform your next recursive step, you don't need the current stack frame any more. This allows for some optimization. In fact, with an appropriately written compiler, you should never have a stack overflow &lt;em&gt;snicker&lt;/em&gt; with a tail recursive call. Simply reuse the current stack frame for the next recursive step. I'm pretty sure Lisp does this.&lt;/p&gt;

  (if (= x 0) 1
      (* x (factorial (- x 1)))))

&lt;p&gt;Here is a version of factorial that is tail-recursive:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-scm prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;(define factorial

    (lambda (x)
      (fact x 1))))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will notice in the first version that the recursive call to fact is fed into the multiplication expression, and therefore the state has to be saved on the stack when making the recursive call. In the tail-recursive version there is no other S-expression waiting for the value of the recursive call, and since there is no further work to do, the state doesn't have to be saved on the stack. As a rule, Scheme tail-recursive functions use constant stack space.&lt;/p&gt;

Generally, this is just fine.  If it's important to you that the ENUM type is used at the database level, you have three options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use "./manage.py sql appname" to see the SQL Django generates, manually modify it to use the ENUM type, and run it yourself.  If you create the table manually first, "./manage.py syncdb" won't mess with it.&lt;/li&gt;

I think the behavior is such because the width is on the table, which I believe (I have nothing to back this up) I read long ago that the table width is a &lt;em&gt;suggested&lt;/em&gt; width, but can be expanded to accommodate it's content.  Not sure.  I know if you use a  rather than a table, it works.  Additionally, if you apply the 300 pixel width to the containing  element as opposed to the  element, it works as well.  Also, the &lt;em&gt;overflow: scroll&lt;/em&gt; does nothing!  :P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice, funky IE behavior, for sure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;produces the desired result. Or, if you're using jQuery, you could add the width through script:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$('textarea[width=100%]').parent('td').css('width', '300px');

&lt;p&gt;I envision a data mining system that monitors a source repo and maybe a continuous integration system and flags significant deltas in various code centric metrics.  The flags ultimately manifest as badges assigned to committers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a few badge ideas off the top of my head:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hatchet Man&lt;/strong&gt; - for largest reduction in overall LOC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detangler&lt;/strong&gt; - for reducing cyclomatic complexity by N points (probably applied to class or method level)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obfuscator&lt;/strong&gt; - for increasing cyclomatic complexity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judas Priest&lt;/strong&gt; - for checking in code that violates the chosen FxCop rules (Breaking the law! Breaking the law! - get it?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Owner&lt;/strong&gt; - for having the most LOC attributed to you (via blame)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risky Business Badge&lt;/strong&gt; - for a check in that results in lower test coverage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixer&lt;/strong&gt; - for a check in resulting in a previously failing test passing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrangler&lt;/strong&gt; - for bringing previously untested code under test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems a great deal of my career has been spent on old hoary codebases in need of some heavy duty refactoring.  Along with those codebases are the programmers stuck maintaining them, who more often than not don't understand the consequences of unnecessary complexity, or if they do, they don't know what to do about it.  This is a way to help them educate themselves, and kind of fun too.&lt;/p&gt;

(I get tired of rewriting the same create/update view logic anytime I need to tweak something Django's generic views don't quite allow).&lt;/p&gt;

After having used them extensively on a couple of projects, I feel they tend to lead to code that is satisfyingly DRY to write, but very hard to read and maintain later, because functionality is spread across so many different places, and subclasses are so dependent on every implementation detail of the superclasses and mixins. I now feel that &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/template-response/"&gt;TemplateResponse&lt;/a&gt; and view decorators is a better answer for decomposing view code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought the point of silverlight was to provide a small, embedded runtime in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding every kitchen sink (like SQL or any kind of ORM library, or parity with WPF) is just going to cause what happened with .net 3.5. Nobody will develop for it because they don't want to burden their end users with a &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6440/net-35-redistributable-200-mb-other-options" rel="nofollow"&gt;200 megabyte download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Top Feature Requests for silverlight would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The smallest download size possible. Last time I looked I think it was at 4.6 meg? This is too big.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One click installation with no disruption. Don't make me navigate off to other sites, reboot my browser*, or DARE reboot my computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Backwards compatibility. I've been to several silverlight sites now which don't work because they require 1.0 and I have 2.0 beta something, but I can't install 1.0 because 2.0 stops it. This is stupid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; yeah I realise it might not be possible within the confines of firefox etc, but still. This is the end goal.&lt;/p&gt;

You set up a series of structure and seed data unit tests for the database. Then, before you change anything, you modify/write tests to reflect that change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been doing this for a while now and it seems to work. We wrote code to generate basic column name and datatype checks in a unit testing suite. We can rerun those tests anytime to verify that the database in the SVN checkout matches the live db the application is actually running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, developers also sometimes tweak their sandbox database and neglect to update the schema file in SVN. The code then depends on a db change that hasn't been checked in. That sort of bug can be maddeningly hard to pin down, but the test suite will pick it up right away. This is particularly nice if you have it built into a larger Continuous Integration plan.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you need random insert and removal,
  the best way is probably a sorted
  array. Inserts and removals should be
  O(log(n)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, but you will need to re-sort on each insert and (maybe) each deletion, which, as you stated, is O(log(n)).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the solution proposed by Harpreet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you have one O(n) pass in the beginning to find the smallest element&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inserts are O(1) thereafter (only 1 comparison needed to the already-known smallest element)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deletes will be O(n) because you will need to re-find the smallest element (keep in mind Big O notation is worst case).  You could also optimize by checking to see if the element to be deleted is the (known) smallest, and if not, just don't do any of the re-check to find the smallest element.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it depends.  One of these algorithms will be better for an insert-heavy use case with few deletes, but the other is overall more consistent.  I think I would default to Harpreet's mechanism unless I knew that the smallest number would be removed often, because that exposes a weak point in that algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

In short, consider carefully; there could be a good reason for it, but if there is be VERY explicit in your comments because it can be brittle and, as you say yourself, people aren't generally used to seeing code like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bitwise xor != Logical xor (except for 0 and 1)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, if you are operating on values other than &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, as integers), the &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt; operator can introduce behavior not equivalent to a logical xor.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int one = 1;
int two = 2;

// bitwise xor
if (one ^ two)
{
  // executes because expression = 3 and any non-zero integer evaluates to true
}

// logical xor; more correctly would be coded as
//   if (bool(one) != bool(two))
// but spelled out to be explicit in the context of the problem
if ((one &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !two) || (!one &amp;amp;&amp;amp; two))
{
  // does not execute b/c expression = ((true &amp;amp;&amp;amp; false) || (false &amp;amp;&amp;amp; true))
  // which evaluates to false
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit to user @Patrick for expressing this first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Order of operations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;, as bitwise operators, do not short-circuit.  In addition, multiple bitwise operators chained together in a single statement -- even with explicit parentheses -- can be reordered by optimizing compilers, because all 3 operations are normally commutative.  This is important if the order of the operations matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;bool result = true;
result = result &amp;amp;&amp;amp; a() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; b();
// will not call a() if result false, will not call b() if result or a() false
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;will not always give the same result (or end state) as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;bool result = true;
result &amp;amp;= (a() &amp;amp; b());
// a() and b() both will be called, but not necessarily in that order in an
// optimizing compiler
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is especially important because you may not control methods &lt;code&gt;a()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b()&lt;/code&gt;, or somebody else may come along and change them later not understanding the dependency, and cause a nasty (and often release-build only) bug.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;the inserts into that would be linear since you have to move items for an insert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doesn't that depend on the implementation of the collection?  If it acts like a linked-list, inserts would be O(1), while if it were implemented like an array it would be linear, as you stated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For internal code (ie code that won't be referenced in any interop manor with other languages) I vote for using unsigned when the situation warrants it, such as &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; variables as mentioned earlier. This - along with checked arithmetic - provides one more net for developers, catching subtle bugs earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another point in the signed vs unsigned debate is that some programmers use values such as -1 to indicate errors, when they wouldn't otherwise have meaning. I subscribe to the view that each variable should have only one purpose, but if you - or colleagues you code with - like to indicate errors in this way, leaving variables signed gives you the flexibility to add error states later.&lt;/p&gt;

I am in the process of collecting some music for the game and would like to use the MIDI format so that I can control the flow of the track (i.e., I would like to have an introduction that only plays once and does not play again when the song loops.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am having a tough time finding information on how to modify existing MIDI files so that they may send a control change signal to the synthesizer.  Has anyone had experience with this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that I should have been more clear with my original question. I am using an existing game engine which takes care of playing the music. I am under the impression that this control change value must be embedded directly in the MIDI file itself as I have no control over the synthesizer. From the manual:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;MIDI files are played via the
  DirectMusic Synthesizer. If a BGM MIDI
  file contains the control change value
  111, that value is recognized as where
  the song will start repeating after it
  reaches the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I could do it programmatically. I suppose what I am after here is some sort of editor which will allow me to modify the MIDI file that I already have. &lt;/p&gt;

There, I'd create a populate a &lt;code&gt;Filter&lt;/code&gt; with a &lt;code&gt;FilteredQuery&lt;/code&gt; wrapping the original &lt;code&gt;Query&lt;/code&gt;. Then I'd get a &lt;code&gt;FieldCache&lt;/code&gt; for the field of interest. Enumerate the hits in the filter's bitset, and for each hit, you get the value of the field from the field cache, and add it to a SortedSet. When you've got all of the hits, divide the size of the set into the number of ranges you want (five to seven is a good number according the user interface guys), and rather than a single-valued constraint, your facets will be a range query with the lower and upper bounds of each of those subsets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd recommend using some special-case logic for a small number of values; obviously, if you only have four distinct values, it doesn't make sense to try and make 5 range refinements out of them. Below a certain threshold (say 3*your ideal number of ranges), you just show the facets normally rather than ranges.&lt;/p&gt;

You also can't ILMerge any assemblies that contain XAML for WPF (at least I haven't had any success with that).  It complains at runtime that the resources cannot be located.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did write a wrapper executable for ILMerge where I pass in the startup exe name for the project I want to merge, and an output exe name, and then it reflects the dependent assemblies and calls ILMerge with the appropriate command line parameters.  It is much easier now when I add new assemblies to the project, I don't have to remember to update the build script.&lt;/p&gt;

Even if that did work, it would still be sort of ghetto to be calling an eval through a select onchange.  Another solution would be to somehow get Rails to inject the onsubmit code into the onchange field of the select tag, but I'm not sure if there's a way to do that.
