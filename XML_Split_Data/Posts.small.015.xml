Threads are swapped out of the CPU as soon as they block waiting for input from file, network, etc. This allows other Python threads to use the CPU while others wait. This would allow you to write a multi-threaded web server or web crawler, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Python threads are serialized by the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Interpreter_Lock"&gt;GIL&lt;/a&gt; when they enter interpreter core. This means that if two threads are crunching numbers, only one can run at any given moment. It also means that you can't take advantage of multi-core or multi-processor architectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are solutions like running multiple Python interpreters concurrently, using a C based threading library. This is not for the faint of heart and the benefits might not be worth the trouble. Let's hope for an all Python solution in a future release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) A lot of output (such as printf) is buffered by default.  If you're debugging crashing code, and you're using buffered debug statements, the last output you see may &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; really be the last print statement encountered in the code.  The solution is to flush the buffer after each debug print (or turn off the buffering altogether).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Be careful with initializations - (a) avoid class instances as globals / statics; and (b) try to initialize all your member variables to some safe value in a ctor, even if it's a trivial value such as NULL for pointers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reasoning: the ordering of global object initialization is not guaranteed (globals includes static variables), so you may end up with code that seems to fail nondeterministically since it depends on object X being initialized before object Y.  If you don't explicitly initialize a primitive-type variable, such as a member bool or enum of a class, you'll end up with different values in surprising situations -- again, the behavior can seem very nondeterministic.&lt;/p&gt;

I assume you are more of a service/client guy.  Which will mean your javascript is probably just as limited... If this is the case, I'd go with Silverlight.  It will ease you into WPF, which you may be likely to use in the future.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But more importantly working with Silverlight 2.0 feels more like building a sandboxed desktop application.  More than a web application.  You will be more at home with Silverlight if your prior experience is with client apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You still have not written a &lt;em&gt;proper&lt;/em&gt; description about the nature of your application. It is difficult to assess which technology is a good fit without first knowing well enough the domain the application is being applied to, and the problems it is designed to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, Microsoft is positioning these array of presentation technologies on the "&lt;strong&gt;Reach vs Rich&lt;/strong&gt;" continuum. You have "plain old" HTML and Javascript on one end, acceptable by the most number of client machines out there, and the ultimate full-blown WPF on the other side where limited number of machines can handle. You did mention this to be an internal app, so WPF via XBAP or ClickOnce are also possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the scale would align this way: (reach) ASP.NET, AJAX, Silverlight, WPF (rich).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the question is just how rich you want/need it to be for the users until it hurts the deployment base? Frankly if all you fetch are forms and tabular data and statistics then regular ASP.NET web forms are just fine. If you want on-the-fly resizable graphs and client-side interactive with back-end WCF web services Silverlight can do that. If you want even more powerful graphical rendering than WPF via the remote deployment options is your bet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seamlessly logging in with OpenID requires automatic (unverified) redirection between domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That makes the OpenID server a 3rd party. This can cause cookies for the OpenID server to be rejected if you turn off 3rd party cookies and your browser strictly follows the Unverifiable Transactions rule in 3.3.6 of RFC2965.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of this is Opera. If you turn off 3rd party cookies (by setting the global to "Accept only cookies from the site I visit"), you can't log in with OpenID because the server script you submit to automatically (without your interaction to approve it) redirects you to the OpenID server and the OpenID server does the same to get you back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, you get lucky in Firefox, IE and Safari with their corresponding blocking of 3rd party cookies because they violate RFC2965 in multiple situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having to use OpenID in this case does a disservice to more compliant clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a workaround, in Opera, besides accepting all cookeis, you can goto tools -&amp;gt; preferences -&amp;gt; advanced -&amp;gt; Network and turn off Automatic Redirection. Then, you'll be able to verify and click each link you're redirected to and the cookies won't be rejected because the transactions are verified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should also work if you keep Automatic Redirection on and both servers generate a page with a link for you to click on so you can verify the transaction. But, there can't be any automatic redirects anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logging in with just a username and password where you're only dealing with first party cookies would be much better in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenID is still cool though and I guess Opera just needs an option to allow unverifiable transactions between SO and your OpenID server so that you can use "Accept only cookies from the site I visit" here.&lt;/p&gt;

That is kind of good, because the stack tells me how deep the recursion is. However, the optimization would be kind of nice as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do any C++ compilers do this optimization? Why? Why not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I go about telling the compiler to do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For MSVC: /O2 or /Ox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For GCC: -O2 or -O3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about checking if the compiler has done this in a certain case?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For MSVC, enable PDB output to be able to trace the code, then inspect the code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For GCC..?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd still take suggestions for how to determine if a certain function is optimized like this by the compiler (even though I find it reassuring that Konrad tells me to assume it)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is always possible to check if the compiler does this at all by making an infinite recursion and checking if it results in an infinite loop or a stack overflow (I did this with GCC and found out that -O2 is sufficient), but I want to be able to check a certain function that I know will terminate anyway. I'd love to have an easy way of checking this :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some testing, I discovered that destructors ruin the possibility of making this optimization. It can sometimes be worth it to change the scoping of certain variables and temporaries to make sure they go out of scope before the return-statement starts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any destructor needs to be run after the tail-call, the tail-call optimization can not be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a href="" onclick="doFoo()"&amp;gt;do foo&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and add an event in a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; section inside the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; section or in an external JavaScript file, like that if you're using &lt;strong&gt;prototypeJS&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Event.observe(window, 'load', function() {
    $('bar').observe('click', doBar);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the first method is easier to read and maintain (because the JavaScript action is directly bound to the link) but it's not so clean (because users can click on the link even if the page is not fully loaded, which may cause JavaScript errors in some cases).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second method is cleaner (actions are added when the page is fully loaded) but it's more difficult to know that an action is linked to the tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which method is the best?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A killer answer will be fully appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So your practical choices are;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One. If your script is simple and the only one that will ever run on the page, create an init function like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;window.onload = function () {

function init() {

&lt;p&gt;I've found the opposite to be true. Bear in mind that sometimes more than one event handler will be bound to a given control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Declaring all events in one central place helps to organize the actions taking place on the site. If you need to change something you don't have to search for all places making a call to a function, you simply have to change it in one place. When adding more elements that should have the same functionality you don't have to remember to add the handlers to them; instead, it's often enough to let them declare a class, or even not change them at all because they logically belong to a container element of which all child elements get wired to an action. From an actual code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$$('#itemlist table th &amp;gt; a').invoke('observe', 'click', performSort);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wired an event handler to all column headers in a table to make the table sortable. Imagine the effort to make all column headers sortable separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am new to threading and I want to delegate a time consuming process to a separate thread in my C++ program.
Using the boost libraries I have written code something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thrd = new boost::thread(boost::bind(&amp;amp;myclass::mymethod, this, &amp;amp;finished_flag);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where finished_flag is a boolean member of my class. When the thread is finished it sets the value and the main loop of my program checks for a change in that value.
I assume that this is okay because I only ever start one thread, and that thread is the only thing that changes the value (except for when it is initialised  before I start the thread)
So is this okay, or am I missing something, and need to use locks and mutexes, etc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) The most important thing is to be consistent. I don't think either of the two methods is necessarily easier to read, as long as you stick to it. I only get confused when both methods are used in a project (or even worse on the same page) because then I have to start searching for the calls and don't immediately know where to look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) The second kind, i.e. Event.observe() has advantages when the same or a very similar action is taken on multiple events because this becomes obvious when all those calls are in the same place. Also, as Konrad pointed out, in some cases this can be handled with a single call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it's a straight &lt;strong&gt;bool&lt;/strong&gt;, then it might work, but it's certainly bad practice, for several reasons. First, some compilers will cache the reads of the *finished_flag* variable, since the compiler doesn't always pick up the fact that it's being written to by another thread. You can get around this by declaring the &lt;strong&gt;bool&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;volatile&lt;/strong&gt;, but that's taking us in the wrong direction. Even if reads and writes are happening as you'd expect, there's nothing to stop the OS scheduler from interleaving the two threads half way through a read / write. That might not be such a problem here where you have one read and one write op in separate threads, but it's a good idea to start as you mean to carry on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, on the other hand it's a thread-safe type, like a CEvent in MFC (or &lt;a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_36_0/doc/html/thread/synchronization.html#thread.synchronization.condvar_ref" rel="nofollow"&gt;equivilent in boost&lt;/a&gt;) then you should be fine. This is the best approach: use thread-safe synchronization objects for inter-thread communication, even for simple flags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just finished working on a project where we implemented our own session mechanism to handle all manner of legacy SOAP stacks, but I believe the recommended way to implement authenticated sessions is to use a Secure Token Service (STS) like &lt;a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/cibrax/archive/2006/09/08/SAML-_2D00_-STS-implementation-for-WCF.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;Pablo Cibraro's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want more details please shout, but I suspect Pablo's blog will have more than enough info for you to steam ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

TOAD is a great program for Oracle (originally written by an Oracle employee in his spare time before being bought by Quest).

I think there are versions of TOAD for MySQL and maybe one or two others, however, the Oracle version is by far the best.

&lt;p&gt;In general, when a browser has an unbreakable object, such as a long string without spaces, it can have a conflict between various size constraints - those of the string (long) vs its container (short).  If you see different behavior in different browsers, they are just resolving this conflict differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, there is a nice trick available for long strings - the &amp;lt;wbr&amp;gt; tag.  If your browser sees longstringlongstring, then it will &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; to fit it in the container as a single, unbroken string -- but if it can't fit, it will break that string in half at the wbr.  It's basically a break point with a implicit request to not break there, if possible (sort of like a hyphen in printed texts).

&lt;p&gt;If you are parsing the files yourself then .NET has a library function to read all the lines from a text file into an array of strings (File.ReadAllLines). If you know your files are small enough to hold in memory, then you can use this method and iterate over the array using a regular expression to validate &amp;amp; extract the fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excel files are a different ball game. .XLS files are binary, not text, so you would need to use a 3rd party library to access them. .XLSX files from Excel 2007 contain compressed XML data, so once again you would need to decompress the XML then use an XML parser to get at the data. I would not recommend writing your own XML parser, unless you feel the need for the intellectual exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have Microsoft Office XP and above, you have access to the already included .NET SDK Office Libraries, where you can "natively" read XLS files, Word, PPT, etc. Please note that under Office XP you have to manually check that during install (unless you had .NET previously installed). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know if these libraries are available as a separate package if you don't have Microsoft Office. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some obscure reason, all these libraries (including the latest versions from Office 2007 -a.k.a.: Office 12), are COM components that are a &lt;em&gt;pain&lt;/em&gt; to use, cause ugly dependencies and are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; backwards compatible. I.E.: if you have some methods that work with Office XP (Office11), and you install that onto a customer with Office 12, it &lt;em&gt;doesn't work&lt;/em&gt;, because some interfaces where changed. So you need to maintain &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; set of "libraries" and methods to deal with that. The same holds true if use Office 12 libraries to program, and you customer has Office 11. Your libraries don't work. :S&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know why Microsoft never created a Microsoft.Office.XXXX managed library (wrapper) around those ugly things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, your question is quite strange, try to follow some advice here. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, VERY easy. Kinda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SQL Server used to be able to talk IPX (the netware protocol) but I think Netware will now talk TCPIP, and you can run IPX and TCP/IP on the same network without an issue - windows clients can run both at the same time, 99% of routers handle all protocols etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows (XP/2003/etc) can run the netware client, so it can talk to shares etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the SQL Server logins (rather than windows integrated logins), and it'll work from anything - we have Java on Linux talking to SQL Server on windows just fine :) It's all in the connection string: userid=username;pwd=whatever;server=yourserverhere; etc. But you MUST use the SQL Server Configuration Manager to set these up - the default is shared memory, so you have to enable TCPIP etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree that this makes it a little more difficult to see what's happening in your page, but good tools like firebug will help you with this a lot. You'll also find much better IDE support available if you keep the mixing of HTML and Javascript to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach really comes into its own as your project grows, and you find you want to attach the same javascript event to a bunch of different element types on many different pages. In that case, it becomes much easier to have a single pace which attaches events, rather than having to search many different HTML files to find where a particular function is called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pages I am working with are the search interface for a site.  You enter terms in a normal search box, click "go and wind up at a search results page.  On the search results page there are a ton of UI controls for filtering/sorting the search results to find what you are looking for.  Some of the operations triggered by these controls may take a (relatively) long time to complete (e.g. several seconds).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This latency is fine in case where the user is initially filtering/sorting their results... there's a nice AJAX spinner and so on... however when the user clicks on a search result and then clicks on the BACK button, I would like the page to instantly be restored to the state it was in when they clicked through.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can restore the states using IFRAMEs/fragment identifiers as a dictionary of page history, but what ends up happening is that when the user first hits the back button the initial page is loaded, then it (re) makes the AJAX query to get the page state back, which triggers the AJAX spinner and another wait of possible several seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any approach that does not require this kind of two-stage load of the page when the user returns to the page via the BACK button?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edited to add: I am partial to jquery but I'd be happy with solutions that depend on other libraries/toolkits or that are standalone/raw javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edited to add: I should've added that I'm trying to avoid cookies/sessions because this prevents people having multiple brower windows/tabs open and manipulating different sets of search results at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A correspondent's key is validated by
  personally checking his key's
  fingerprint and then signing his
  public key with your private key. By
  personally checking the fingerprint
  you can be sure that the key really
  does belong to him, and since you have
  signed they key, you can be sure to
  detect any tampering with it in the
  future. Unfortunately, this procedure
  is awkward when either you must
  validate a large number of keys or
  communicate with people whom you do
  not know personally. GnuPG addresses this problem with a mechanism popularly known as &gt; the web of trust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="http://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html#AEN335"&gt;Web Of Trust&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the web of trust model,
  responsibility for validating public
  keys is delegated to people you trust.
  For example, suppose&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alice has signed Blake's key, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blake has signed Chloe's key and Dharma's key.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;If Alice trusts Blake to properly
  validate keys that he signs, then
  Alice can infer that Chloe's and
  Dharma's keys are valid without having
  to personally check them. She simply
  uses her validated copy of Blake's
  public key to check that Blake's
  signatures on Chloe's and Dharma's are
  good. In general, assuming that Alice
  fully trusts everybody to properly

Javascript should be unobtrusive so inline (ie, the first example) is not really the best choice in my opinion. When looking at the html, the only sign that you are using js should be the script includes in the head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of attaching (and handling) events might be something like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var myObject = {

    allLinkElements: null, 

    init: function()
    {
     // Set all the elements we need
     myObject.setElements();

     // Set event handlers for elements
     myObject.setEventHandlers();
    },

    clickedLink: function()
    {
     // Handle the click event
     alert('you clicked a link');
    },

    setElements: function()
    {
     // Find all &amp;lt;a&amp;gt; tags on the page
     myObject.allLinkElements = $('a');

     // Find other elements...
    },

    setEventHandlers: function()
    {
     // Loop through each link
     myObject.allLinkElements.each(function(id)
     { 
      // Assign the handler for the click event
      $(this).click(myObject.clickedLink);
     });

     // Assign handlers for other elements...
    }
}

// Wait for the DOM to be ready before initialising
$(document).ready(myObject.init);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this approach is useful if you want to keep all of your js organised, as you can use specific objects for tasks and everything is nicely contained. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the huge benefit of letting jQuery (or another well known library) do the hard work is that cross-browser support is (largely) taken care of which makes life much easier&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The background is that the system in Delphi needs to allocate a lots of chunks of memory that would go well outside 32bit addressable space. The Delphi developer explained to me that he could not allocate memory with the Delphi commands available to him. He says that he can hold a 64bit address, so he just wants to call a function I provide to allocate the memory and return a 64bit pointer to him. Then another function to free up the memory later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I only have VS 2008 at my disposal so firstly I'm not even sure I can create a Delphi compatible dll in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any Delphi experts care to help me out. Maybe there is a way to achieve what he requires without re-inventing the wheel. Other developers must have come across this before in Delphi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All comments appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In this case OysterD's code will be the fastest solution (vertex coloring)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;That would really surprise me. My solution makes at most two passes through the list (if the last node is linked to the penultimate lode), and in the common case (no loop) will make only one pass. With no hashing, no memory allocation, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. I've noticed that the formulation wasn't perfect and have rephrased it. I still believe that a clever hashing might perform faster  by a hair. I believe your algorithm &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the best solution, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to underline my point: the vertec coloring is used to detect cycles in dependencies by modern garbage collectors so there is a very real use case for it. They mostly use bit flags to perform the coloring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But seriously, it depends on your goals. I agree that the native UI libraries, with a bunch of effort put into them, will give vastly better results, but for lots of apps, a very basic UI is sufficient and a lot less effort if you take one of the existing cross platform frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a 32 bits Delphi exe can not load your 64 bit c++ dll. It could load a 32 bit c++ dll, but then that dll wouldn't be able to address the 64 bit memory space. You are kind of stuck with this solution.&lt;/p&gt;

Even more memory could be accessed by a 32 bits process if it uses &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Address_Extension" rel="nofollow"&gt;Physical Address Extension.

&lt;p&gt;One by one (from prisoner #1 to prisoner #100, in order), they will be let into a room B in which 100 boxes (numbered from 1 to 100) await them. Inside the (closed) boxes are numbers from 1 to 100 (the numbers inside the boxes are randomly permuted!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once inside room B, each prisoner gets to open 50 boxes (he chooses which one he opens). If he finds the number that was assigned to him in one of these 50 boxes, the prisoner gets to walk into a room C and all boxes are closed again before the next one walks into room B from room A. Otherwise, all prisoners (in rooms A, B and C) gets killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before entering room B, the prisoners can agree on a strategy (algorithm). There is no way to communicate between rooms (and no message can be left in room B!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find a strategy (algorithm) that maximizes the probability that all prisoners survive. What probability does your algorithm achieve?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that I did ask if it was OK to post puzzles. I'd like to get some feedback from people downvoting if possible!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;@Ross: doing things randomly (what you call 'no strategy') indeed gives a probability of 1/2 for each prisoner, but then the probability of all of them surviving is 1/2^100 (which is quite low). One can do much better!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prisoners are not allowed to reorder the boxes!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, be assured that I do have an interesting solution. I'll post it in a week or so :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;@Sam Hasler: all prisoners are killed the first time a prisoner fails to find his number. &lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt; no communication is possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hint&lt;/b&gt;: one can save more than 30 prisoners &lt;em&gt;on average&lt;/em&gt;, which is much more that (50/100) * (50/99) * [...] * 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;@Rob Cooper: I get your point (no point in yelling!), however it reflects your opinion (and that of some others I'm sure), and I don't yet see a consensus on that matter. I do respect your opinion (didn't vote on your answer, or on any other by the way), but I'd really like to have this clarified (in the FAQ for example...).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;@Jorge: I still didn't get into the details of your solution, but I believe that you can indeed do it this way. However, this is basically using time to communicate. The solution I have in mind doesn't involve any kind of communication (so people can't rely on time, for example).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;@chakrit: it would help if you provided the probability that your method achieves. In case it's too complicated to work out, running simulations (Monte-Carlo like) would give you an estimate!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;@jbettis: &lt;strong&gt;this is indeed the solution&lt;/strong&gt; I had in mind (and believe me or not, but I found it myself when presented with the problem). As for the wording, I'm sorry but I'm not a native English speaker. For the specific wordings you refer to: for me, saving more that 30 on average is equivalent to your wording; also the problem is the same if you kill all prisoners as soon as one fails...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;first we make some assumptions about the situation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The prisoners are not all programmers or mathematicians&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They don't want to die&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The guards are well armed&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;its all about losses v potential gain, the chances are the prisoners far out number the guards, and using each other as human shields, as they are all dead men anyway if they don't, they can increase the chances they will over power a guard, once they have his weapon there chance goes up, helping them over power more guards to get more fire power to further increase there survival rate. once the guards realise what's happening, they will probably run for the hills and lock down the prison, this will give the media a heads up and then its a human rights issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If he finds the number that was
  assigned to him in one of these 50
  boxes, the prisoner gets to walk into
  a room C and all boxes are closed
  again before the next one walks into
  room B from room A. Otherwise, all
  prisoners (in rooms A, B and C) gets
  killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the last sentence there mean that all prisoners are killed the first time a prisoner fails to find their number? If not, what happens to prisoners that don't find their number?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If no communication is possible, and whenever a prisoner enters room B it is always in an identical state then there is no possibility for a strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prisoners could could say before they leave room A which number box they are going to open. But without subsequent prisoners knowing whether they were successful or not (assuming failure for one isn't failure for all) when the next prisoner enters room B they still have the same odds of picking their number as the previous prisoner (always 1:100).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If failure for one is failure for all, then by knowing which box the previous prisoners opened, and by dint of the fact that they haven't all been killed, each successive prisoner could reduce the odds of picking the wrong box by one box. i.e. 1:100 for the first prisoner, 1:99 for the second, down to 1:1 for the last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for example the BFS algorthm to traverse trees with was implemented like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(define (BFS graph root-discovered node-discovered edge-discovered edge-bumped . nodes)
  (define visited (make-vector (graph.order graph) #f))
  (define q (queue.new))
  (define exit ())
  (define (BFS-tree node)
    (if (node-discovered node)
      (exit node))
    (graph.map-edges
     graph
     node
     (lambda (node2)
       (cond ((not (vector-ref visited node2))
              (when (edge-discovered node node2)
                (vector-set! visited node2 #t)
                (queue.enqueue! q node2)))
             (else
              (edge-bumped node node2)))))
    (if (not (queue.empty? q))
      (BFS-tree (queue.serve! q))))

  (call-with-current-continuation
   (lambda (my-future)
     (set! exit my-future)
     (cond ((null? nodes)
            (graph.map-nodes
             graph
             (lambda (node)
               (when (not (vector-ref visited node))
                 (vector-set! visited node #t)
                 (root-discovered node)
                 (BFS-tree node)))))
           (else
            (let loop-nodes
              ((node-list (car nodes)))
              (vector-set! visited (car node-list) #t)
              (root-discovered (car node-list))
              (BFS-tree (car node-list))
              (if (not (null? (cdr node-list)))
                (loop-nodes (cdr node-list)))))))))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see the algorithm will exit when the node-discovered function returns true:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    (if (node-discovered node)
      (exit node))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the function will also give a "return value": 'node'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;why the function exits, is because of this statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(call-with-current-continuation
       (lambda (my-future)
         (set! exit my-future)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when we use exit, it will go back to the state before the execution, emptying the call-stack and return the value you gave it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically, call-cc is used (here) to jump out of a recursive function, instead of waiting for the entire recursion to end by itself (which can be quite expensive when doing lots of computational work)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;another smaller example doing the same with call-cc:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(define (connected? g node1 node2)
  (define visited (make-vector (graph.order g) #f))
  (define return ())
  (define (connected-rec x y)
    (if (eq? x y)
      (return #t))
    (vector-set! visited x #t)
    (graph.map-edges g
                     x
                     (lambda (t)
                       (if (not (vector-ref visited t))
                         (connected-rec t y)))))
  (call-with-current-continuation
   (lambda (future)
     (set! return future)
     (connected-rec node1 node2)
     (return #f))))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Ok, I think this makes it. Of course I'm treating this as a computing problem, I don't think any prisioner will be able to perform this, although is pretty straight forward if you don't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find the first 50 primes, let's asume we hold them in an array called primes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first prissioner enters room B and opens the first box and finds the number m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait primes[1]^m (that would be 3^m)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open box 2 and read the number --&gt; n&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait (primes[2]^n - 1) * primes[1]^m, that would be (5^n - 1) * 3^m and the total time he has been waiting would be 3^n * 5^n&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repeat. After the first prisioner the total time for him would be:
3^m * 5^n * 7^p ... = X&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the second prisioner enters the room factorize X. You know beforehand the prime numbers that have been used so the factorization is trivial. Doing so you obtain m, n, p, etc so the second prisioner knows every box/number combination the previous prisioner used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The probability of the first one getting everybody killed is 1/2, the second one will have a 50 / (100 - n) (being n the numbers of attemps of the first one) the third one will have 50 / (100 - n -  m) (if n + m = 100 then all positions are known) and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously the next prissioner must skip the already known boxes (except for the last choice if the box which contains his number is already known)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know what's the exact possibility as it dependes on how many choices they have to do but I'd say it's pretty high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Rereading, if the prissioner does not have to stop when he obtains his number then the probability for the whole group is vastly improved, exactly 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT2: @OysterD see it this way. If the first prisioner can open 50 boxes then the second one know if its number is in any of that boxes. If it is, then he can open other 49 (and by doing so learning the box/number comination of the 100 boxes) and finally open his one. So if the first prissioner succeds then everyone succeds. Remember that each prisioner provides a way for the other to know exactly the boxes/number combination for every box he opens.&lt;/p&gt;

This is basically the way XML is meant to be treated. Then just go through the hierarchy recursively, adding the number of words together as you go. When you hit your limit throw everything else away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work mainly in PHP, and I would use the DOMDocument class in PHP to help me do this, you need to find something like that in your chosen language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make things clearer, here is the hierarchy for your sample:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- p
    - Proin tristique dapibus neque. Nam eget purus sit amet leo
      tincidunt accumsan.
- p
    - Proin semper, orci at mattis blandit, augue justo blandit nulla.
    - span
          - Quisque ante congue justo
    - , ultrices aliquet, mattis eget, hendrerit, 
    - em
          - justo
    - .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You hit the 25 word limit inside the span element, so you remove all remaining text within the span and add the ellipsis. All other child elements (both text and tags) can be discarded, and all subsequent elements can be discarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should always leave you with valid markup as far as I can see, because you are treating it as a hierarchy and not just plain text, all closing tags that are required will still be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course if the XHTML you are dealing with is invalid to begin with, don't expect the output to be valid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the poor hierarchy example, couldn't work out how to nest lists.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steps are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restore View&lt;/strong&gt;. The UIComponent tree is rebuilt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apply Request Values&lt;/strong&gt;. Editable components should implement EditableValueHolder. This phase walks the component tree and calls the &lt;em&gt;processDecodes&lt;/em&gt; methods. If the component isn't something complex like a UIData, it won't do much except call its own &lt;em&gt;decode&lt;/em&gt; method. The &lt;em&gt;decode&lt;/em&gt; method doesn't do much except find its renderer and invokes its &lt;em&gt;decode&lt;/em&gt; method, passing itself as an argument. It is the renderer's job to get any submitted value and set it via &lt;em&gt;setSubmittedValue&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Process Validations&lt;/strong&gt;. This phase calls &lt;em&gt;processValidators&lt;/em&gt; which will call &lt;em&gt;validate&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;validate&lt;/em&gt; method takes the submitted value, converts it with any converters, validates it with any validators and (assuming the data passes those tests) calls &lt;em&gt;setValue&lt;/em&gt;. This will store the value as a local variable. While this local variable is not null, it will be returned and not the value from the value binding for any calls to &lt;em&gt;getValue&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Model Values&lt;/strong&gt;. This phase calls &lt;em&gt;processUpdates&lt;/em&gt;. In an input component, this will call &lt;em&gt;updateModel&lt;/em&gt; which will get the &lt;em&gt;ValueExpression&lt;/em&gt; and invoke it to set the value on the model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invoke Application&lt;/strong&gt;. Button event listeners and so on will be invoked here (as will navigation if memory serves).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Render Response&lt;/strong&gt;. The tree is rendered via the renderers and the state saved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If any of these phases fail (e.g. a value is invalid), the lifecycle skips to Render Response.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various events can be fired after most of these phases, invoking listeners as appropriate (like value change listeners after Process Validations).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a somewhat simplified version of events. Refer to the specification for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would question why you are writing your own UIComponent. This is a non-trivial task and a deep understanding of the JSF architecture is required to get it right. If you need a custom control, it is better to create a concrete control that extends an exisiting UIComponent (like HtmlInputText does) with an equivalent renderer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If contamination isn't an issue, there is an open-source JSF implementation in the form of Apache MyFaces.&lt;/p&gt;

As of version 3.0 it &lt;a href="http://www.phpunit.de/manual/current/en/test-doubles.html#test-doubles.mock-objects" title="PHPUnit Mock Objects"&gt;has mocking&lt;/a&gt; support, is being actively developed, and the documentation is excellent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really the only way to answer this question for yourself is to try both out for a time, and see which fits your style better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Phing now integrates with SimpleTest as well.&lt;/p&gt;

This is quick, returning a page of 50 rows from millions of records in a small fraction of a second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users can define their own sort, basically choosing what column to sort by.  Columns are dynamic - some have numeric values, some dates and some text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most sort as expected text sorts in a dumb way. Well, I say dumb, it makes sense to computers, but frustrates users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, sorting by a string record id gives something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;rec1
rec10
rec14
rec2
rec20
rec3
rec4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want this to take account of the number, so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;rec1
rec2
rec3
rec4
rec10
rec14
rec20
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't control the input (otherwise I'd just format in leading 000s) and I can't rely on a single format - some are things like "{alpha code}-{dept code}-{rec id}".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know a few ways to do this in C#, but can't pull down all the records to sort them, as that would be to slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know a way to quickly apply a natural sort in Sql server?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're using:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ROW_NUMBER() over (order by {field name} asc)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then we're paging by that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can add triggers, although we wouldn't. All their input is parametrised and the like, but I can't change the format - if they put in "rec2" and "rec10" they expect them to be returned just like that, and in natural order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have valid user input that follows different formats for different clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might go rec1, rec2, rec3, ... rec100, rec101&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While another might go: grp1rec1, grp1rec2, ... grp20rec300, grp20rec301&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I say we can't control the input I mean that we can't force users to change these standards - they have a value like grp1rec1 and I can't reformat it as grp01rec001, as that would be changing something used for lookups and linking to external systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These formats vary a lot, but are often mixtures of letters and numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorting these in C# is easy - just break it up into &lt;code&gt;{ "grp", 20, "rec", 301 }&lt;/code&gt; and then compare sequence values in turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However there may be millions of records and the data is paged, I need the sort to be done on the SQL server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SQL server sorts by value, not comparison - in C# I can split the values out to compare, but in SQL I need some logic that (very quickly) gets a single value that consistently sorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@moebius - your answer might work, but it does feel like an ugly compromise to add a sort-key for all these text values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One process loses out and must wait for the other to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;deadlock&lt;/strong&gt; occurs when the waiting process is still holding on to another resource that the first needs before it can finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resource A and resource B are used by process X and process Y&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X starts to use A.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X and Y try to start using B&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Y 'wins' and gets B first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;now Y needs to use A&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A is locked by X, which is waiting for Y&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid deadlocks is to avoid having processes cross over in this way. Reduce the need to lock anything as much as you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In databases avoid making lots of changes to different tables in a single transaction, avoid triggers and switch to optimistic/dirty/nolock reads as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function resizeFlash( h ) {
    // "flash-node-id" is the ID of the embedded Flash movie
    document.getElementById("flash-node-id").style.height = h + "px";
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which you call from within the Flash movie like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ExternalInterface.call("resizeFlash", 400);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't actually need to have the JavaScript code externally, you can do it all from Flash if you want to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ExternalInterface.call(
    "function( id, h ) { document.getElementById(id).style.height = h + 'px'; }",
    ExternalInterface.objectID,
    400
);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anonymous function is just to be able to pass in the ID and height as parameters instead of concatenating them into the JavaScript string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that the JavaScript is fairly cross-platform. If you want to see a live example look at this site: &lt;a href="http://www.talkoftheweather.com/"&gt;talkoftheweather.com&lt;/a&gt;. It may not look as though it does anything, but it automatically resizes the Flash movie size to accommodate all the news items (it does this just after loading the news, which is done so quickly that you don't notice it happening). The resize forces the browser to show a vertical scroll bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A tail call [tail recursion] is a kind of goto dressed
  as a call. A tail call happens when a
  function calls another as its last
  action, so it has nothing else to do.
  For instance, in the following code,
  the call to g is a tail call:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-lua prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function f (x)
  return g(x)
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After f calls g, it has nothing else
  to do. In such situations, the program
  does not need to return to the calling
  function when the called function
  ends. Therefore, after the tail call,
  the program does not need to keep any
  information about the calling function
  in the stack.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Because a proper tail call uses no
  stack space, there is no limit on the
  number of "nested" tail calls that a
  program can make. For instance, we can
  call the following function with any
  number as argument; it will never
  overflow the stack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-lua prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function foo (n)
  if n &amp;gt; 0 then return foo(n - 1) end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As I said earlier, a tail call is a
  kind of goto. As such, a quite useful
  application of proper tail calls in
  Lua is for programming state machines.
  Such applications can represent each
  state by a function; to change state
  is to go to (or to call) a specific
  function. As an example, let us
  consider a simple maze game. The maze
  has several rooms, each with up to
  four doors: north, south, east, and
  west. At each step, the user enters a
  movement direction. If there is a door
  in that direction, the user goes to
  the corresponding room; otherwise, the
  program prints a warning. The goal is
  to go from an initial room to a final
  room.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;This game is a typical state machine,
  where the current room is the state.
  We can implement such maze with one
  function for each room. We use tail
  calls to move from one room to
  another. A small maze with four rooms
  could look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-lua prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function room1 ()
  local move = io.read()
  if move == "south" then return room3()
  elseif move == "east" then return room2()
  else print("invalid move")
       return room1()   -- stay in the same room
  end
end

function room2 ()
  local move = io.read()
  if move == "south" then return room4()
  elseif move == "west" then return room1()
  else print("invalid move")
       return room2()
  end
end

function room3 ()
  local move = io.read()
  if move == "north" then return room1()
  elseif move == "east" then return room4()
  else print("invalid move")
       return room3()
  end
end

function room4 ()
  print("congratulations!")
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you see, when you make a recursive call like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-lua prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function x(n)
  if n==0 then return 0
  n= n-2
  return x(n) + 1
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not tail recursive because you still have things to do (add 1) in that function after the recursive call is made. If you input a very high number it will probably cause a stack overflow.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Rules 1 &amp;amp; 3 are contradictory to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To a certain extent, they are. The reason is simple: if an object is stored in a hash table and, by changing its value, you change its hash then the hash table has lost the value and you can't find it again by querying the hash table. It is important that while objects are stored in a hash table, they retain their hash value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To realize this it is often simplest to make hashable objects immutable, thus evading the whole problem. It is however sufficient to make only those fields immutable that determine the hash value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the following example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;struct Person {
    public readonly string FirstName;
    public readonly string Name;
    public readonly DateTime Birthday;

    public int ShoeSize;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People rarely change their birthday and most people never change their name (except when marrying). However, their shoe size may grow arbitrarily, or even shrink. It is therefore reasonable to identify people using their birthday and name but not their shoe size. The hash value should reflect this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public int GetHashCode() {
    return FirstName.GetHashCode() ^ Name.GetHashCode() ^ Birthday.GetHashCode();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Because the thread scheduling algorithm can swap between threads at any time, you don't know the order in which the threads will attempt to access the shared data. Therefore, the result of the change in data is dependent on the thread scheduling algorithm, i.e. both threads are "racing" to access/change the data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems often occur when one thread does a "check-then-act" (e.g. "check" if the value is X, then "act" to do something that depends on the value being X) and another thread does something to the value in between the "check" and the "act". E.g:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (x == 5) // The "Check"
{
   y = x * 2; // The "Act"

   // If another thread changed x in between "if (x == 5)" and "y = x * 2" above,
   // y will not be equal to 10.
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point being, y could be 10, or it could be anything, depending on whether another thread changed x in between the check and act. You have no real way of knowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to prevent race conditions from occurring, you would typically put a lock around the shared data to ensure only one thread can access the data at a time. This would mean something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Obtain lock for x
if (x == 5)
{
   y = x * 2; // Now, nothing can change x until the lock is released. 
              // Therefore y = 10
}
// release lock for x

When you have two threads attempting to access a single resource, the general pattern is to have the first block of code attempting access to set the mutex before entering the code. When the second code block attempts access, it sees the mutex is set and waits until the first block of code is complete (and un-sets the mutex), then continues.&lt;/p&gt;

Looking at the current documentation on Object.GetHashCode (&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.object.gethashcode.aspx"&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.object.gethashcode.aspx&lt;/a&gt;) provides the following "rules":&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If two objects compare as equal, the GetHashCode method for each object must return the same value. However, if two objects do not compare as equal, the GetHashCode methods for the two object do not have to return different values. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GetHashCode method for an object must consistently return the same hash code as long as there is no modification to the object state that determines the return value of the object's Equals method. Note that this is true only for the current execution of an application, and that a different hash code can be returned if the application is run again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the best performance, a hash function must generate a random distribution for all input. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are referring to the second bullet point, the key phrases here are "as long as there is no modification to the object state" and "true only for the current execution of an application". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also from the documentation, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A hash function is used to quickly generate a number (hash code) that corresponds to the &lt;strong&gt;value&lt;/strong&gt; of an object. Hash functions are usually specific to each Type and must use at least one of the &lt;strong&gt;instance&lt;/strong&gt; fields as input. [&lt;em&gt;Emphasis added is mine.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the actual implementation, it clearly states that derived classes can defer to the Object.GetHashCode implementation &lt;strong&gt;if and only if&lt;/strong&gt; that derived class defines value equality to be reference equality and the type is not a value type. In other words, the default implementation of Object.GetHashCode is going to be based on reference equality since there are no real instance fields to use and, therefore, does not guarantee unique return values for different objects. Otherwise, your implementation should be specific to your type and should use at least one of your instance fields. As an example, the implementation of String.GetHashCode returns identical hash codes for identical string values, so two String objects return the same hash code if they represent the same string value, and uses all the characters in the string to generate that hash value.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I guess I could create separate fields, then have a view that sort of coalesces them into a single logical column. Any opinions on that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It depends on the source of the data.  If you are getting the data from users (or some other system) in some free-form manner and don't really care what type of data it is, then the best way to store it is the most generic manner (varchar, etc).  If the incoming data is more structured and you care about that structure, then it makes more sense to keep that structure in the database by using separate fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the viewpoint of a SELECT it doesn't really matter; you can store it either way and read it as the same schema.  Once you get into filters (as you mention) things get a bit more hairy, but still easily doable.  However, you don't mention if you need to be able to update this data and if so, if you need to enforce any validation on the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the sounds of it, you need to do different types of searches based on the "type" of value being stored.  As such, it may make sense to add a Type field so that any filters can be quickly limited to the type of values that you care about.  Note, by Type I mean a more logical, application scope, Type; not the actual datatype being stored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My recommendation would be to use a single field with a Type column if you need to easily support UPDATEs or use multiple fields (or tables, if these are totally different data sets) if SELECTing and filtering is all that is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I would question why you are writing your own UIComponent. This is a non-trivial task and a deep understanding of the JSF architecture is required to get it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I've struggled with whether to use JSF at all for exactly this reason.  It is the only framework that I've ever used where component creation is a deep intricate process like this.  None of the other web frameworks (whether in the .net world or not) make this so painful, which is completely inexplicable to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've stuck with JSF largely for the promise that 2.0 will make it much less painful.  The component is a composition of several inputtext (and other) base components, btw.&lt;/p&gt;

It may also be used implicitly via the '&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/c5kehkcz(VS.80).aspx"&gt;lock(Object)&lt;/a&gt;' statement. One example of its use is when constructing a Singleton class.&lt;/p&gt;

The first thread will enter the section and initialize the instance. The second thread will wait, get into the section, and get the initialized instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any sort of synchronization of a static member may use the lock statement similarly.&lt;/p&gt;

A race condition, at its most basic, is anything that makes the assumption that two things not in the same thread or process will happen in a particular order, without taking steps to ensure that they do.  This happens commonly when two threads are passing messages by setting and checking member variables of a class both can access.  There's almost always a race condition when one thread calls sleep to give another thread time to finish a task (unless that sleep is in a loop, with some checking mechanism).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools for preventing race conditions are dependent on the language and OS, but some comon ones are mutexes, critical sections, and signals.  Mutexes are good when you want to make sure you're the only one doing something.  Signals are good when you want to make sure someone else has finished doing something.  Minimizing shared resources can also help prevent unexpected behaviors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detecting race conditions can be difficult, but there are a couple signs.  Code which relies heavily on sleeps is prone to race conditions, so first check for calls to sleep in the affected code.  Adding particularly long sleeps can also be used for debugging to try and force a particular order of events.  This can be useful for reproducing the behavior, seeing if you can make it disappear by changing the timing of things, and for testing solutions put in place.  The sleeps should be removed after debugging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The signature sign that one has a race condition though, is if there's an issue that only occurs intermittently on some machines.  Common bugs would be crashes and deadlocks.  With logging, you should be able to find the affected area and work back from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the explanation. The float:left works beautifully with expected results in FF 3.1. Unfortunately, in IE6 the right side span renders 50% of the 50%, in effect giving it a width of 25% of the browser window. Setting its width to 100% achieves the desired results but breaks in FF 3.1 which is in standards compliance mode and I understand that. Getting it to work both in FF and IE 6, without resorting to hacks or using multiple CSS sheets has been a challenge&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would recommend using a VCS that has been designed with frequent merging in mind from the start.  bzr is the one I've used that does this, but the other major distributed vcs systems (git and mercurial) also do.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But ultimately I don't know of any research on this specific area.  In general there is very little research into efficiency of programming, &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0932633439" rel="nofollow"&gt;Peopleware&lt;/a&gt; being one of the notable exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you insist on having the "shared" members implemented as static members of the derived class, you might be able to auto-generate the code of the derived classes. XSLT is a great tool for auto-generating simple classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, the example doesn't show a need for "virtual static" members, because for purposes like these you don't actually need inheritance - instead you should use the base class and have it accept the appropriate values in the constructor - maybe creating a single instance of the arguments for each "sub-type" and passing a pointer to it to avoid duplication of the shared data. Another similar approach is to use templates and pass as the template argument a class that provides all the relevant values (this is commonly referred to as the "Policy" pattern).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude - for the purpose of the original example, there is no need for such "virtual static" members. If you still think they are needed for the code you are writing, please try to elaborate and add more context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of what I described above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class BaseClass {
    public:
        BaseClass(const Descriptor&amp;amp; desc) : _desc(desc) {}
        string GetName() const { return _desc.name; }
        int GetId() const { return _desc.Id; }
        X GetX() connst { return _desc.X; }
        virtual void UseClass() = 0;
    private:
        const Descriptor _desc;
};


class DerivedClass : public BaseClass {
    public:
        DerivedClass() : BaseClass(Descriptor("abc", 1,...)) {}
        virtual void UseClass() { /* do something */ }
};

class DerDerClass : public BaseClass {
    public:
        DerivedClass() : BaseClass("Wowzer", 843,...) {}
        virtual void UseClass() { /* do something */ }
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd like to elaborate on this solution, and maybe give a solution to the de-initialization problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a small change, you can implement the design described above without necessarily create a new instance of the "descriptor" for each instance of a derived class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can create a singleton object, DescriptorMap, that will hold the single instance of each descriptor, and use it when constructing the derived objects like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;enum InstanceType {
    Yellow,
    Big,
    BananaHammoc
}

class DescriptorsMap{
    public:
        static Descriptor* GetDescriptor(InstanceType type) {
            if ( _instance.Get() == null) {
                _instance.reset(new DescriptorsMap());
            }
            return _instance.Get()-&amp;gt; _descriptors[type];
        }
    private:
        DescriptorsMap() {
            descriptors[Yellow] = new Descriptor("Yellow", 42, ...);
            descriptors[Big] = new Descriptor("InJapan", 17, ...)
            ...
        }

        ~DescriptorsMap() {
            /*Delete all the descriptors from the map*/
        }

        static autoptr&amp;lt;DescriptorsMap&amp;gt; _instance;
        map&amp;lt;InstanceType, Descriptor*&amp;gt; _descriptors;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we can do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class DerivedClass : public BaseClass {
    public:
        DerivedClass() : BaseClass(DescriptorsMap.GetDescriptor(InstanceType.BananaHammoc)) {}
        virtual void UseClass() { /* do something */ }
};

class DerDerClass : public BaseClass {
    public:
        DerivedClass() : BaseClass(DescriptorsMap.GetDescriptor(InstanceType.Yellow)) {}
        virtual void UseClass() { /* do something */ }
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of execution, when the C runtime performs uninitializations, it also calls the destructor of static objects, including our autoptr, which in deletes our instance of the DescriptorsMap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now we have a single instance of each descriptor that is also being deleted at the end of execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that if the only purpose of the derived class is to supply the relevant "descriptor" data (i.e. as opposed to implementing virtual functions) then you should make do with making the base class non-abstract, and just creating an instance with the appropriate descriptor each time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this so developers can automatically generate a login form that posts directory to the remote server when the OpenID is known?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;eg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User is not logged in and visits your login page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You detect the user's openID from a cookie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Form is generated that directly posts to remote OpenID server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remote server redirects user back to website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Website logs in the user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is the case I can see the benefit. However this assumes that you keep the user's openID in a cookie when they log out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can find very little information on how this spec should be best implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

When inserting a value, always populate the "string" column indpendent of the type, however if the value is numeric, ALSO store it in the "numeric" column. Now you have a built in indicator as to the type (if the "numeric" column is populated it is numeric, if not it is a string), can always just pull the value for display from the "string" column, and can use the "numeric" value in calculations or for proper numeric sorting / comparison as needed. You could always add a third column indicating the value type, but this approach eliminates the need for that.

&lt;p&gt;For row based security this means we could add an annotation such as &lt;code&gt;@Secured&lt;/code&gt; at the entity level, which would cause an extra column to be added to the underlying table to constrain our selects?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For column based security, we could perhaps have &lt;code&gt;@Secured&lt;/code&gt; to either assist in query generation, or perhaps use an aspect to filter the information returned?&lt;/p&gt;

This will only reset the limit for your current shell and the number you specify must not exceed the hard limit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each operating system has a different hard limit setup in a configuration file.  For instance, the hard open file limit on Solaris can be set on boot from /etc/system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;set rlim_fd_max = 166384
set rlim_fd_cur = 8192

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;soft&lt;/strong&gt; limits are simply the currently enforced limits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hard&lt;/strong&gt; limits mark the maximum value which cannot be exceeded by setting a soft limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soft limits could be set by any user while hard limits are changeable only by root.
Limits are a property of a process. They are inherited when a child process is created so system-wide limits should be set during the system initialization in init scripts and user limits should be set during user login for example by using pam_limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are often defaults set when the machine boots.  So, even though you may reset your ulimit in an individual shell, you may find that it resets back to the previous value on reboot.  You may want to grep your boot scripts for the existence ulimit commands if you want to change the default. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; Code removed. &lt;a href="#34710" rel="nofollow"&gt;Carl Meyer's version&lt;/a&gt; did the same thing my original code did, but cleaner and simpler, especially using the .hover() jquery method instead of .mouseover(), and using real objects almost everywhere, instead of easily-broken string selectors. If you switched IDs in the future, you would only need to modify slide_for_switch() and the selector used in his $(document).ready() method.&lt;/p&gt;

Depending on the context different criteria determine the quality of a hash. Two people already mentioned SHA. This is a cryptographic hash and it isn't at all good for hash tables which you probably mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hash tables have very different requirements. But still, finding a good hash function universally is hard because different data types expose different information that can be hashed. As a rule of thumb it is good to consider &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; information a type holds equally. This is not always easy or even possible. For reasons of statistics (and hence collision), it is also important to generate a good spread over the problem space, i.e. all possible objects. This means that when hashing numbers between 100 and 1050 it's no good to let the most significant digit play a big part in the hash because for ~ 90% of the objects, this digit will be 0. It's far more important to let the last three digits determine the hash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when hashing strings it's important to consider all characters  except when it's known in advance that the first three characters of all strings will be the same; considering these then is a waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internally we're using helpers to get/set &lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;private static&lt;/code&gt; variables as well as invoke &lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;private static&lt;/code&gt; methods. The following patterns will let you do pretty much anything related to the private methods and fields. Of course you can't change &lt;code&gt;private static final&lt;/code&gt; variables through reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Method method = targetClass.getDeclaredMethod(methodName, argClasses);
method.setAccessible(true);
return method.invoke(targetObject, argObjects);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for fields:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Field field = targetClass.getDeclaredField(fieldName);
field.setAccessible(true);
field.set(object, value);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;br&gt;
*  &lt;code&gt;targetClass.getDeclaredMethod(methodName, argClasses)&lt;/code&gt; lets you look into &lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt; methods. The same thing applies for &lt;code&gt;getDeclaredField&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
*  The &lt;code&gt;setAccessible(true)&lt;/code&gt; is required to play around with privates.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standard hack has been to look at the name of the process that is running and if it is "DevEnv.EXE" then it must be studio thus DesignMode is really TRUE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given a hash of a message it is computationally infeasible for an attacker to find another message such that their hashes are identical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given a pair of message, m' and m, it is computationally infeasible to find two such that that h(m) = h(m')&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two cases are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the same. In the first case, there is a pre-existing hash that you're trying to find a collision for. In the second case, you're trying to find &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; two messages that collide. The second task is significantly easier due to the birthday "paradox."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where performance is not that great an issue, you should always use a secure hash function. There are very clever attacks that can be performed by forcing collisions in a hash. If you use something strong from the outset, you'll secure yourself against these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't use MD5 or SHA-1 in new designs. Most cryptographers, me included, would consider them broken. The principle source of weakness in both of these designs is that the second property, which I outlined above, does not hold for these constructions. If an attacker can generate two messages, m and m', that both hash to the same value they can use these messages against you. SHA-1 and MD5 also suffer from message extension attacks, which can fatally weaken your application if you're not careful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more modern hash such as Whirpool is a better choice. It does not suffer from these message extension attacks and uses the same mathematics as AES uses to prove security against a variety of attacks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get the behavior you're looking for, you can write your own class which is like Integer only mutable. Then, just pass it to the recursive function, it is incremented within the recursion, and when you access it again after the recursion is over it will still maintain its new values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you could try something like this (I'm spit-balling without a compiling example, but the idea should be clear).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;string&amp;gt;

struct DerivedData

};


class Derived : public Base {
public:
  Derived() : Base() {
    if(Derived::s_data == 0) {
      Derived::s_data = new DerivedData("abc", 1);
    }

DerivedData * Derived::s_data = 0;

  cout getWord() &amp;lt;&amp;lt; endl;

The code would have to be user friendly and as small as possible, but still be essentially random (so users couldn't easily predict the next code in the sequence).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It ended up generating values that looked something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Af3nT5Xf2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I was never satisfied with the implementation.  Guid's were out of the question, they were simply too big and difficult for users to type in.  I was hoping for something more along the lines of 4 or 5 characters/digits, but our particular implementation would generate noticeably patterned sequences if we encoded to less than 9 characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's what we ended up doing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pulled a unique sequential 32bit id from the database.  We then inserted it into the center bits of a 64bit RANDOM integer.  We created a lookup table of easily typed and recognized characters (A-Z, a-z, 2-9 skipping easily confused characters such as L,l,1,O,0, etc.).  Finally, we used that lookup table to base-54 encode the 64-bit integer.  The high bits were random, the low bits were random, but the center bits were sequential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final result was a code that was much smaller than a guid and looked random, even though it absolutely wasn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was never satisfied with this particular implementation.  What would you guys have done?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; Private Declare Unicode Function GetCurrentThemeName Lib "uxtheme" (ByVal stringThemeName As System.Text.StringBuilder, ByVal lengthThemeName As Integer, ByVal stringColorName As System.Text.StringBuilder, ByVal lengthColorName As Integer, ByVal stringSizeName As System.Text.StringBuilder, ByVal lengthSizeName As Integer) As Int32

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
Dim stringThemeName As New System.Text.StringBuilder(260)
Dim stringColorName As New System.Text.StringBuilder(260)

ASP.NET provides a common location for registering the implementation of IControlBinders. They also have the basics of this working via the new Controller.UpdateModel method. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I essentially combined these two concepts by creating an implementation of IModelBinder that does the same thing as Controller.UpdateModel for all public properties of the modelClass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class ModelBinder : IModelBinder 
{
    public object GetValue(ControllerContext controllerContext, string modelName, Type modelType, ModelStateDictionary modelState)

        object model = Activator.CreateInstance(modelType);

        PropertyDescriptorCollection properties = TypeDescriptor.GetProperties(model);
        foreach (PropertyDescriptor descriptor in properties)
        {
            string key = modelName + "." + descriptor.Name;
            object value = ModelBinders.GetBinder(descriptor.PropertyType).GetValue(controllerContext, key, descriptor.PropertyType, modelState);
            if (value != null)
            {
                try
                {
                    descriptor.SetValue(model, value);
                    continue;
                }

                {
                    string errorMessage = String.Format("The value '{0}' is invalid for property '{1}'.", value, key);
                    string attemptedValue = Convert.ToString(value);
                    modelState.AddModelError(key, attemptedValue, errorMessage);
                }
            }
        }

        return model;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your Global.asax.cs you'd need to add something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    protected void Application_Start()
    {
        ModelBinders.Binders.Add(typeof(Contact), new ModelBinder());

&lt;p&gt;I have tried using an External Interrupt to listen to the pins, but it seems like it is too slow. When Pin A goes high, the interrupt procedure starts and then checks if Pin B is high. The idea is that if Pin B is high the moment Pin A went high, then it is rotating counter clock-wise. If Pin B is low, then it is rotating clock-wise. But it seems like the AVR takes too long to check Pin B, so it is always read as high. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've also tried to create a program that simply blocks until Pin B or Pin A changes. But it might be that there is too much noise when the encoder is rotated, because this does not work either. My last attempt was to have a timer which stores the last 8 values in a buffer and checks if it is going from low to high. This did not work either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried scoping the encoder, and it seems to use between 2 and 4ms from the first Pin changes till the other Pin changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd obtain a list of common English words with usage frequency and some grammatical information (like is it a noun or a verb?). I think you can look around the intertubes for some copy. Firefox is open-source and it has a spellchecker... so it must be obtainable somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I'd run a filter on it so obscure words are removed and that words which are too long are excluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then my generation algorithm would pick 2 words from the list and concatenate them and add a random 3 digits number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can also randomize word selection pattern between verb/nouns like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;eatCake778&lt;br /&gt;
  pickBasket524&lt;br /&gt;
  rideFlyer113
  etc..&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the case needn't be camel casing, you can randomize that as well. You can also randomize the placement of the number and the verb/noun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And since that's a lot of randomizing, Jeff's &lt;a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001015.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Danger of Navet&lt;/a&gt; is a must-read. Also make sure to study dictionary attacks well in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And after I'd implemented it, I'd run a test to make sure that my algorithms should never collide. If the collision rate was high, then I'd play with the parameters (amount of nouns used, amount of verbs used, length of random number, total number of words, different kinds of casings etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take this example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;for ( int i = 0; i &amp;lt; 10000000; i++ )
{
   x = x + 1; 
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you had 5 threads executing this code at once, the value of x WOULD NOT end up being 50,000,000.  It would in fact vary with each run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because, in order for each thread to increment the value of x, they have to do the following: (simplified, obviously)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Retrieve the value of x
Add 1 to this value
Store this value to x
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any thread can be at any step in this process at any time, and they can step on each other when a shared resource is involved.  The state of x can be changed by another thread during the time between x is being read and when it is written back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say a thread retrieves the value of x, but hasn't stored it yet.  Another thread can also retrieve the &lt;b&gt;same&lt;/b&gt; value of x (because no thread has changed it yet) and then they would both be storing the &lt;b&gt;same&lt;/b&gt; value (x+1) back in x!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Thread 1: reads x, value is 7
Thread 1: add 1 to x, value is now 8
Thread 2: reads x, &lt;b&gt;value is 7&lt;/b&gt;
Thread 1: stores 8 in x
Thread 2: adds 1 to x, value is now 8
Thread 2: &lt;b&gt;stores 8 in x&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Race conditions can be avoided by employing some sort of &lt;b&gt;locking&lt;/b&gt; mechanism before the code that accesses the shared resource:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;for ( int i = 0; i &amp;lt; 10000000; i++ )
{
   //lock x
   x = x + 1; 
   //unlock x
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, the answer comes out as 50,000,000 every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more on locking, search for: mutex, semaphore, critical section, shared resource.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It is the only framework that I've

  a deep intricate process like this.
  None of the other web frameworks

  make this so painful, which is
  completely inexplicable to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the design decisions behind JSF start to make a little more sense when you consider the goals. JSF was designed to be tooled - it exposes lots of metadata for IDEs. JSF is not a web framework - it is a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_Presenter" rel="nofollow"&gt;MVP&lt;/a&gt; framework that can be used as a web framework. JSF is highly extensible and configurable - you can replace 90% of the implementation on a per-application basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of this stuff just makes your job more complicated if all you want to do is slip in an extra HTML control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The component is a composition of
  several inputtext (and other) base
  components, btw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm assuming JSP-includes/tooling-based page fragments don't meet your requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would consider using your &lt;em&gt;UIComponentELTag.createComponent&lt;/em&gt; to create a composite control with a UIPanel base and creating all its children from existing implementations. (I'm assuming you're using JSPs/taglibs and making a few other guesses.) You'd probably want a custom renderer if none of the existing UIPanel renderers did the job, but renderers are easy.&lt;/p&gt;

It might be OK at first, but eventually 1 client is going to need some new functionality and require a change to the library.  Invariably this leads to problems with some of the other clients, creating a huge mess.  Unless you've got a good way to version your library file, this is a tough problem to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Some of the design decisions behind JSF start to make a little more sense when you consider the goals. JSF was designed to be tooled - it exposes lots of metadata for IDEs. JSF is not a web framework - it is a MVP framework that can be used as a web framework. JSF is highly extensible and configurable - you can replace 90% of the implementation on a per-application basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of that, I think the only part that I agree with is the "a little more sense".  The metadata could have been exposed in other ways in JSF 1.2, and frankly, I have yet to see an IDE make decent use of it.  Why can't an IDE give me a simple way to build a component?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've used ASP.Net as well, and by comparison, JSF feels like it was written by a bunch of architecture astronauts led by a guy like the original Struts designer.  Oh wait... :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been working today in modifying ASP.NET's Membership to add a level of indirection. Basically, ASP.NET's Membership supports Users and Roles, leaving all authorization rules to be based on whether a user belongs to a Role or not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I need to do is add the concept of Function, where a user will belong to a role (or roles) and the role will have one or more functions associated with them, allowing us to authorize a specific action based on if the user belongs to a role which has a function assigned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, my problem has nothing to do with it, it's a generic class design issue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to provide an abstract method in my base RoleProvider class to create the function (and persist it), but I want to make it optional to save a description for that function, so I need to create my CreateFunction method with an overload, one signature accepting the name, and the other accepting the name and the description. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can think of the following scenarios: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create both signatures with the abstract modifier. This has the problem that the implementer may not respect the best practice that says that one overload should call the other one with the parameters normalized, and the logic should only be in the final one (the one with all the parameters). Besides, it's not nice to require both methods to be implemented by the developer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create the first like virtual, and the second like abstract. Call the second from the first, allow the implementer to override the behavior. It has the same problem, the implementer could make "bad decisions" when overriding it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same as before, but do not allow the first to be overriden (remove the virtual modifier). The problem here is that the implementer has to be aware that the method could be called with a null description and has to handle that situation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the best option is the third one... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is this scenario handled in general? When you design an abstract class and it contains overloaded methods. It isn't that uncommon I think... &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Gaius: A Null Pointer exception gets thrown for you automatically by the runtime, there is no benefit to testing that stuff in the function prologue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have two responses to this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Null was just an example.  For square(x), I'd want to test that the square root of the result is (approximately) the value of the parameter.  For setters, I'd want to test that the value actually changed.  For atomic operations, I'd want to check that all component operations succeeded or all failed (really one test for success and n tests for failure).  For factory methods in weakly-typed languages, I want to check that the right kind of object is returned.  The list goes on and on.  Basically, anything that can be tested in one line of code is a very good candidate for a code contract in a prologue comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I disagree that you shouldn't test things because they generate runtime exceptions.  If anything, you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; test things that might generate runtime exceptions.  I like runtime exceptions because they make the system &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast" rel="nofollow"&gt;fail fast&lt;/a&gt;, which helps debugging.  But the &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; in the example was a result value for some possible input.  There's an argument to be made for never returning &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, but if you're going to, you should test it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Version 2 is out and available from XP SP3, Server 2003, Vista, and Server 2008 and in the box for Win7 and Server 2008 R2.  What you learned for V1 will still serve you well, but now I would concentrate on V2, as there is a superior feature set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, GetHashCode() isn't guaranteed to return unique values for all possible object states. It's conceivable (though unlikely) that two object states could result in the same HashCode (which does, after all, only have an int's worth of possible states; see &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle" rel="nofollow"&gt;the Pigeonhole Principle&lt;/a&gt; for more details).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can ensure that Equals() checks all of the appropriate fields, then you could possibly clone the object to record its state and then check it with Equals() against the new state to see if its changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW: Your mention of serialization gave me an idea. You could serialize the object, record it, and then when you check for object changing, repeat the process and compare the serialized values. That would let you check for state changes without having to make any code changes to your object. However, this isn't a great solution, because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's probably very inefficient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's prone to serialization changes in the object; you might get false positives on the object state change.&lt;/li&gt;

This of course assumes that the public &lt;code&gt;doIt&lt;/code&gt; method is only called by a single thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option is to refactor the public method to call a private helper method.  The private method takes the list as a parameter and returns the count.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public List&amp;lt;Thing&amp;gt; doIt(String aString) {
    List&amp;lt;Thing&amp;gt; list = new ArrayList&amp;lt;Thing&amp;gt;();
    int count = doItHelper(aString, list, 0);
    // ...
    return list;
}

private int doItHelper(String aString, List&amp;lt;Thing&amp;gt; list, int count) {
    // ...
    // do something that updates count
    count = doItHelper(aString, list, count);
    // ...
    return count;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assumes that you can do the error handling in the public &lt;code&gt;doIt&lt;/code&gt; method, since the &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; variable isn't actually passed back to the caller.  If you need to do that, you could of course throw an exception:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public List&amp;lt;Thing&amp;gt; doIt(String aString) throws SomeCustomException {
    List&amp;lt;Thing&amp;gt; list = new ArrayList&amp;lt;Thing&amp;gt;();
    int count = doItHelper(aString, list, 0);
    // ...
    if (someErrorOccurred) {
        throw new SomeCustomException("Error occurred at chracter index " + count, count);
    }
    return list;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could create a template as follows ( have not tried to compile this ):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
template &amp;lt;typename T&amp;gt;
class Object
{
public:

  Object( const T&amp; newObject ) : yourObject(newObject) {} ;
  T GetObject() const { return yourObject } ;
  void SetObject( const T&amp; newObject ) { yourObject = newObject } ;

protected:

  const T yourObject ;
} ;

class SomeClassOne
{
public:

  SomeClassOne( const std::vector&amp; someData )
  {
    yourData.SetObject( someData ) ;
  }

private:

  Object&amp;lt;std::vector&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;&amp;gt; yourData ;
} ;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will let you use the template class methods to modify the data as needed from within your custom classes that use the data and share the various aspects of the template class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're intent on using inheritance, then you might have to resort to the "joys" of using a void* pointer in your BaseClass and dealing with casting, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, based on your explanation, it seems like you need templates and not inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you want to check if the cookie needs recreating, re - serialize the object and compare this new base 64 string against the one stored in a member variable. If it has changed, reset the cookie with the new value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch out for the gotcha - don't include the member variable storing the base 64 serialization in the serialization itself. I presume your language uses something like a sleep() function (is how PHP does it) to serialize itself, so just make sure the member is not included in that function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will always work because you are comparing the exact value you'd be saving in the cookie, and wouldn't need to override GetHashCode() which sounds like it could have nasty consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that said I'd probably just drop the test and always reset the cookie, can't be that much overhead in it when compared to doing the change check, and far less likelyhood of bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That works for local forms that open in InfoPath.  Nathan was asking about web-enabled forms.  ActiveX controls are disabled for web forms, as evidenced by the informational label at the bottom of the design controls when the form compatability has been set to the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I will admit that I know nothing about the HTML tags to play audio in a browser, but I have something else that might work.  I had an InfoPath form that I needed to dynamically load an image into for a web-enabled form.  Similar to the ActiveX issue, the Picture control was also disabled.  What I did was put some managed code behind the form and execute the following when the form loaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public void FormEvents_Loading(object sender, LoadingEventArgs e)
{
    string imgPath = "http://yoursite/yourimage.jpeg";

    XPathNodeIterator xpni = MainDataSource.CreateNavigator().SelectSingleNode("/my:FormName/my:RichTextControlName", NamespaceManager).SelectChildren(XPathNodeType.All);
    xpni.Current.InnerXml = "&amp;lt;img xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" src=\"" + filePath + "\" width=\"200px\" height=\"55px\" /&amp;gt;";    
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't see why you couldn't take the same approach and load audio rather than an image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I on the right path or not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information available for each prisoner:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The number of survivied prisoners, so if you have an efficient box picking system that  utilizes the order any prisoner enters room B, then &lt;strong&gt;a strategy is definitely possible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Which boxes the earlier prisoners picked. Of course, no communication is possible &lt;em&gt;during&lt;/em&gt; the run and it wouldn't be possible to remember any 100s box picking permutation. &lt;strong&gt;But you could use this information to compute in a system &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the run starts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My take:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Draw a table of numbers with 2 columns, the first column contains the box number (from box #1 to box#100). Each prisoner then gets to pick 50 boxes and whatever box they pick, they should put 1 mark on the corresponding row in the second column.  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All prisoners are however required to never pick any box twice. And no box may be marked more than 50. Some prisoners may get less options than others since some box may get filled to 50 marks first.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When a prisoner is moved to room B he/she opens whatever boxes he has marked on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Write down a list of the first 100 binary numbers which has fifty 1s and fifty 0s.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;He/she opens whatever boxes matched with 1 and leave closed boxes matched with 0.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would minimizes the probability because early prisoners will get digits that are different from the later prisoners and prisoners which has number close together would get digits close together. This doesn't guarantee survivability but if the early prisoners do survive, chances are the later prisoners would have a higher probability of surviving as well.&lt;/p&gt;

The filters will rewrite the queries hibernate generates to include an additional clause to limit the rows returned.  I'm not aware of anything in hibernate to mask/hide columns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your database may also have support for this functionality.  Oracle, for example, has the &lt;a href="http://www.devshed.com/c/a/Oracle/RowLevel-Security-with-Virtual-Private-Database/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Virtual Private Database&lt;/a&gt; (VPD) which will rewrite your queries at the database level.  This solution has the added benefit that any external program (e.g. reporting tools) that goes against your db will have your security restrictions enforced.  VPD also has support to mask restricted columns with NULLs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the above solutions have not been adequate to support the security requirements for the types projects I typically work on.  There is usually some sort of context that cannot be easily expressed in the above solutions.  For example, users can view data that they have created, or that have been been marked as public, or belong to a project which they manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We typically create query/finder/DAO objects where we pass in the values required to enforce the security and then create the query accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps&lt;/p&gt;

I may need to take the First and Last name fields and concatenate them into a third field that gets inserted to the database. I'm going to sanitize the input before I even do the concatenation so I don't get any kind of processing or insertion errors. The sooner the better. Even using Javascript on the front end (in a web setup) is ideal because that will occur without any data going to the server to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scary part is that you might even want to start sanitizing data coming out of your database as well. The recent surge of ASPRox SQL Injection attacks that have been going around are doubly lethal because it will infect all database tables in a given database.

I had code working just fine on my machine, from VS, msbuild command line, everything, but it failed on the build server (running .NET 3.5 RTM).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[XmlRoot("foo")]
public class Foo
{
    static void Main()
    {
        XmlSerializer serializer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(Foo));

        string xml = @"&amp;lt;foo name='ack' /&amp;gt;";
        using (StringReader sr = new StringReader(xml))
        {
            Foo foo = serializer.Deserialize(sr) as Foo;
        }
    }

    [XmlAttribute("name")]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public Foo Bar { get; private set; }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In SP1, the above code runs just fine. In RTM, you get an InvalidOperationException:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Unable to generate a temporary class (result=1).
  error CS0200: Property or indexer 'ConsoleApplication2.Foo.Bar' cannot be assign to -- it is read only&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, all that's needed to make it run under RTM is adding [XmlIgnore] to the Bar property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My google fu is apparently not up to finding documentation of these kinds of changes. Is there a change list anywhere that lists this change (and similar under-the-hood changes that might jump up and shout "gotcha")?  Is this a bug or a feature? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;: In SP1, if I added a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Bar /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element, or set [XmlElement] for the Bar property, it won't get deserialized.  It doesn't fail pre-SP1 when it tries to deserialize--it throws an exception when the XmlSerializer is constructed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes me lean more toward it being a bug, especially if I set an [XmlElement] attribute for Foo.Bar. If it's unable to do what I ask it to do, it should be throwing an exception instead of silently ignoring Foo.Bar.  Other invalid combinations/settings of XML serialization attributes result in an exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you, &lt;a href="#35223" rel="nofollow"&gt;TonyB&lt;/a&gt;, I'd not known about setting the temp files location. For those that come across similar issues in the future, you do need an additional config flag:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;system.diagnostics&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;switches&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;add name="XmlSerialization.Compilation" value="1" /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/switches&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/system.diagnostics&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;system.xml.serialization&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;xmlSerializer tempFilesLocation="c:\\foo"/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/system.xml.serialization&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with setting an [XmlElement] attribute on the Bar property, no mention was made of it in the generated serialization assembly--which fairly firmly puts this in the realm of a silently swallowed error (aka, a bug). Either that or the designers have decided [XmlIgnore] is no longer necessary for properties that can't be set--and you'd expect to see that in release notes, &lt;a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/951847" rel="nofollow"&gt;change lists&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.serialization.xmlignoreattribute.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;XmlIgnoreAttribute documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First go for clarity, both because it is easier to read and understand. Also, if you try to be too clever a simple reordering of the terms could lead to wildly different behaviour without any apparent reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, go for optimisation, but only after timing and profiling. Way too many developer  do premature optimisation without profiling. Most of the time it's completely useless.&lt;/p&gt;

Anytime you expose an child object as a reference the internals of that child can be changed without the parent "knowing" unless the child has a property changed event.  Is there a risk for memory leaks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, don't options 2 and 3 break serialization? Is this a catch 22 or do you have to implement custom serialization anytime you have a collection property?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The generic ReadOnlyCollection seems like a nice compromise for general use. It wraps an IList and restricts access to it.  Maybe this helps with memory leaks and serialization.  However it still has &lt;a href="http://www.coversant.net/Coversant/Blogs/tabid/88/EntryID/34/Default.aspx"&gt;enumeration concerns&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it just depends.  If you don't care that the collection is modified, then just expose it as a public accessor over a private variable per #1. If you don't want other programs to modify the collection then #2 and/or #3 is better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implicit in the question is why should one method be used over another and what are the ramifications on security, memory, serialization, etc.?&lt;/p&gt;

  that. Here's an actual formula from

&lt;p&gt;maybe the safer approach would be to print every occurence of "indirect" in a third sheet. you could then add the desired output and write a small search and replace program to write your changes back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The folder structure would look like this (1 QA line, 2 hotfix releases, and the trunk):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;/branches&lt;/p&gt;

There are several different libraries that you can use for your client application and there is no server software needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the strengths is that it mimics SQL servers so closely that if you need to convert from using a database file to a full-fledged SQL Server, most of your queries in your client won't need to change. You'll just need to migrate the data over to the new server database (which I wouldn't be surprised if there are programs to convert SQLite databases to MySQL databases, for example.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important thing to determine for yourself is whether or not a library will fit your particular style and sensibilities. Wide-spread ignorance about how &lt;a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the language, actually works, coupled with the negative press resulting thereby, coupled with the now-immense popularity of jQuery leads most people down that road. Thankfully, it isn't a bad road to be on as there are a lot of travellers to keep you company when the abstractions leak and you need help. You probably can't go wrong choosing jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;

Tainted data can be used and passed around, but it taints any data that it comes in contact with until untainted.  For instance, if user input is appended to another string, the new string is also tainted.  Basically, any expression that contains tainted values will output a tainted result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tainted data can be thrown around at will (tainting data as it goes), but as soon as it is used by a command that has effect on the outside world, the perl script fails.  So if I use tainted data to create a file, construct a shell command, change working directory, etc, Perl will fail with a security error.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not aware of another language that has something like "taint", but using it has been very eye opening.  It's amazing how quickly tainted data gets spread around if you don't untaint it right away.  Things that natural and normal for a programmer, like setting a variable based on user data or opening a file, seem dangerous and risky with tainting turned on.  So the best strategy for getting things done is to untaint as soon as you get some data from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I suspect that's the best way in other languages as well: validate user data right away so that bugs and security holes can't propagate too far.  Also, it ought to be easier to audit code for security holes if the potential holes are in one place.  And you can never predict which data will be used for what purpose later.&lt;/p&gt;

Configure the profiler to record the results to a new table, and then check the queries saved there to find all the tables (and views, sps, etc) that are used by your applications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way I think you might check if there's any "writes" is to add a new timestamp column to every table, and a trigger that updates that column every time there's an update or an insert. But keep in mind that if your apps do queries of the type &lt;/p&gt;

It is pretty poorly publicised, as it is an unsexy addition, but as I understand it, is absolutely necessary for generics to work.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, the compiler now allows a subclass to narrow the return type of an overridden method to be a subclass of the original method's return type.  So this is allowed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Souper {
    Collection&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; values() {
        ...
    }
}

class ThreadSafeSortedSub extends Souper {
    @Override
    ConcurrentSkipListSet&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; values() {
        ...
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can call the subclass's &lt;code&gt;values&lt;/code&gt; method and obtain a sorted thread safe &lt;code&gt;Set&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;s &lt;strong&gt;without having to down cast&lt;/strong&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;ConcurrentSkipListSet&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But instead of the MD5 being just of the configuration file, also include some secret "key" value, like a fixed guid, in the MD5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;write(MD5(SecretKey + ConfigFileText));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you simply remove that MD5 and rehash the file (including your secret key).  If the MD5's are the same, then no-one modified it.  This prevents someone from modifying it and re-applying the MD5 since they don't know your secret key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind this is a fairly weak solution (as is the one you are suggesting) as they could easily track into your program to find the key or where the MD5 is stored.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A better solution would be to use a public key system and sign the configuration file.  Again that is weak since that would require the private key to be stored on their local machine.  Pretty much anything that is contained on their local PC can be bypassed with enough effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you REALLY want to store the information in your executable (which I would discourage) then you can just try appending it at the end of the EXE.  That is usually safe.  Modifying executable programs is &lt;em&gt;virus like&lt;/em&gt; behavior and most operating system security will try to stop you too.  If your program is in the Program Files directory, and your configuration file is in the Application Data directory, and the user is logged in as a non-administrator (in XP or Vista), then you will be unable to update the EXE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I don't care if you are using Asymmetric encryption, RSA or Quantum cryptography, if you are storing your keys on the user's computer (which you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; do unless you route it all through a web service) then the user can find your keys, even if it means inspecting the registers on the CPU at run time!  You are only buying yourself a moderate level of security, so stick with something that is simple.  To prevent modification the solution I suggested is the best.  To prevent reading then encrypt it, and if you are storing your key locally then use AES Rijndael.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;  The FixedGUID / SecretKey could alternatively be generated at install time and stored somewhere "secret" in the registry.  Or you could generate it every time you use it from hardware configuration.  Then you are getting more complicated.  How you want to do this to allow for moderate levels of hardware changes would be to take 6 different signatures, and hash your configuration file 6 times - once with each.  Combine each one with a 2nd secret value, like the GUID mentioned above (either global or generated at install).  Then when you check you verify each hash separately.  As long as they have 3 out of 6 (or whatever your tolerance is) then you accept it.  Next time you write it you hash it with the new hardware configuration.  This allows them to slowly swap out hardware over time and get a whole new system. . . Maybe that is a weakness.  It all comes down to your tolerance.  There are variations based on tighter tolerances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt;  For a Credit Card system you might want to consider some real security.  You should retain the services of a &lt;em&gt;security and cryptography consultant&lt;/em&gt;.  More information needs to be exchanged.  They need to analyze your specific needs and risks.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you want security with .NET you need to first start with a really good .NET obfuscator (&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=.NET%20obfuscator&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=" rel="nofollow"&gt;just Google it&lt;/a&gt;).  A .NET assembly is way to easy to disassemble and get at the source code and read all your secrets.  Not to sound a like a broken record, but anything that depends on the security of your user's system is fundamentally flawed from the beginning.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately without more information I can't troubleshoot your particular problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which microcontroller pins are connected to the encoder, and what is the code you're currently using to decode the pulses?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, you're dealing with a few different issues, the first issue is that this is a mechanical encoder, so you have to deal with switch noise (bounce, chatter).  The &lt;a href="http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/103465.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;data sheet&lt;/a&gt; indicates that it may take up to 3mS for the parts to stop bouncing and creating false outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to create a debounce routine.  The simplest of which is to continuously check to see if A goes high.  If it does, start a timer and check it again in 3 ms.  If it's still high, then you can check B - if it's not high then you ignore the spurious pulse and continue looking for A high.  When you check B, you look at it, start a timer for 3 ms, and then look at B again.  If it was the same both times, then you can use that value - if it changes within 3 ms then you have to do it again (read B, wait 3 ms, then read it again and see if it matches).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The atmega is fast enough that you shouldn't have to worry about these checks going slowly, unless you're also running a slow clock speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you deal with the mechanical noise, then you want to look at a proper gray code routine - the algorithm you're following won't work unless you also decrement if A is high when B goes low.  Generally people store the last value of the two inputs, and then compare it to the new value of the two inputs and use a small function to increment or decrement based on that. (Check out the heading "high resolution reading" on the website I mentioned above for the table).  I combine the two readings into a four bit number and use a simple array to tell me whether I increment or decrement the counter, but there are solutions that are even more advanced, and optimize for code size, speed, or ease of code maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

  the least likely candidate for `other-buffer' to return; thus, the
  least likely buffer for C-x b to select by default.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;You can specify a buffer name as BUFFER-OR-NAME, or an actual buffer
  object.  If BUFFER-OR-NAME is nil or omitted, bury the current buffer.

&lt;p&gt;Yikes!  Who would ever want to work in such an oppressive environment?  If you're lucky, she's sending around her resume and you'll be able to hire someone who is on board with your development process.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming you want to hang on to her, I'd turn down (or off) the rhetoric and work on being a friend and co-worker first.  If the project is a year late, she can't be feeling good about herself and it sounds like you aren't afraid to trumpet your success.  That can be intimidating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know nothing about Scrum, however.  I'm just imagining what it would be like to walk around in your co-worker's shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

It's done automatically by running a job that runs the tests and then makes the check-in to source control upon successful test completion. Second, cruise control kicks off build and regression tests. The product is built then several sets of integration tests are run. The number of tests vary by where we are in the release cycle. More testing is added late in the cycle during ramp down. Cruise control takes all submissions within a certain time window (12 minutes) so your changes may be built and tested with a small number of others. Third, there's an automated nightly build and tests that are quite extensive. We have load or milestone points every 2 or 3 weeks. At a load point, all automated tests are run plus manual testing is done. Performance testing is also done for each milestone. Performance tests can be kicked off on request but the hardware available is limited so people have to queue up for performance tests. Usually people rely on the load performance tests unless they are making changes specifically to improve performance. Finally, stress tests are also done for each load. These tests are focussed on making sure the product has no memory leaks or anything else that prevents 24/7 running of the product as opposed to performance. All of this is done with ant, cruise control, and Python scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience with TFS (2005) has been pretty horrible.  I've read all kinds of whitepapers &amp;amp; guidance as to how to properly structure your source for various development needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our simple situation, where we have a trunk with mainline development, and integration branch where we integrate changes &amp;amp; deploy from, and a releases branch to keep track of past releases is very common and straightforward, but we are continually running into problems.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main issues with TFS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merging is a PAIN in comparison to subversion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are unfixed bugs.  I ran into one about renaming/merging that has been known for 2 years and a fix will never be released for 2005.  We ended up moving our branch to a "broken" folder and we ignore it now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Putting read-only locks on your files is friction.  Who says I need to edit batch files and build scripts inside of TFS so that it will "check it out" for me?  Subversion &lt;em&gt;knows&lt;/em&gt; which files changed.  There are no readonly locks there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speed.  TFS is dog-slow over a WAN, and it's really only usable if I VPN into my work computer, which makes my dev experience really slow overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of good command-line and explorer integration.  IDE integration is really nice for the day-to-day Get-Latest, adding files, and checking in, but when you need to do things across many projects, it's nice to have good tools at your disposal.  And before someone jumps down my throat claiming tf.exe works well... it's not really a cmd line tool.  For example, checking in code shouldn't pop up a modal dialog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...the list goes on.  I think even with all of the integration, there are free alternatives that are far superior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In pre SP1 you wouldn't be able to deserialize the object because the set method of the Bar property is private so the XmlSerializer doesn't have a way to set that value.  I'm not sure how SP1 is pulling it off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could try adding this to your web.config/app.config&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am working on a site that will allow the user to download very large files (up to and exceeding 100GB)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the best way to do this &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;without using FTP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  The end user must be able to download the file from there browser using HTTP.  I don't think Flash or Silverlight can save files to the client so as far as I know they won't cut it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm guessing we will need an ActiveX or Java applet to pull this off.  Something like the download manager that MSDN uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know of a commercial (or free) component that will do that?  We do not want the user to have to install a "browser wide" download manager (like GetRight), we want it to only work with downloading on our site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Here is some additional info to help clarify what I'm trying to do.  Most of the files above the 4GB limit would be large HD video files (its for a video editing company).  These will be downloaded by users across the internet, this isn't going to be people on a local network.  We want the files to be available via HTTP (some users are going to be behind firewalls that aren't going to allow FTP, Bittorrent, etc.).  The will be a library of files the end user could download, so we aren't talking about a one time large download.  The will be download different large files on a semi-regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far Vault that @Edmund-Tay suggested is the closest solution so far.  The only problem is that it doesn't work for files larger than 4GB (it instantly fails before starting the download, they are probably using a 32bit integer somewhere that the content length of the file exceeds).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A java applet (or ActiveX component since the problem only exist in IE) that worked like the article @spoulson linked to would be the best solution, but so far I haven't had any luck finding one that does anything like that (multipart downloads, resume, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like we might have to write our own.  Another option would be to write a .Net application (maybe ClickOnce) that is associated with an extension or mime type.  Then the user would actually be downloading a small file from the web server that opens in the exe/ClickOnce app that tells the application what file to download.  That is how the MSDN downloader works.  The end user would then only have to download/install an EXE once.  That would be better than downloading an exe every time they wanted to download a large file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it's a small system, and you fully understand it, then a rewrite is not crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if it's a giant legacy monster with ten million lines of undocumented mystery code, then you're really going to have a hard time with a full rewrite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Points to consider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it looks good to the user, they
won't care what kind of spaghetti
mess it is for you.  On the other
hand, if it's bad for them too, then
it's easier to get agreement (and
patience).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you do rewrite, try to do it one
part at a time.  A messy,
disorganized codebase may make this
difficult (i.e, replacing just one
part requires a rewrite of large
icebergs of dependency code), but if
possible, this makes it a lot easier
to gradually do the rewrite and get
feedback from users along the way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would really hesitate to take on a giant rewrite project for a large system without being able to release the new edition one part at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes.  Also supports Windows, Mac, and embedded environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some sort of "editor" that would allow us to lay out screens without hard-coding locations of elements in code&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;not resource intensive (these terminals don't have a lot of memory or CPU)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might be the fly in the ointment.  You could check out Qt's embedded option.  I've never used that myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    import mx.core.Application;
    import mx.events.FlexEvent;
    import flexunit.framework.TestCase;

    public class CustomComponentTest extends TestCase {

            // set some properties...

            component.addEventListener(FlexEvent.CREATION_COMPLETE, 
                addAsync(verifySomeAspect, 5000));

            component.height = 0;
            component.width = 0;
            Application.application.addChild(component);
        }

        public function verifySomeAspect(event:FlexEvent) : void {
            // Assert some things about component...
        }

        override public function tearDown() : void {
            try {
                if (component) {
                    Application.application.removeChild(component);
                    component = null;
                }
            } catch (e:Error) {
                // ok to ignore
            }
        }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, you need to make sure the component has been fully initialized before you can reliably verify anything about it, and in Flex this happens asynchronously after it has been added to the display list.  So you need to setup a callback (using FlexUnit's addAsync function) to be notified when that's happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately i've been just manually calling the methods that the runtime would call for you in the necessary places, so now my tests tend to look more like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    import flexunit.framework.TestCase;

    public class CustomComponentTest extends TestCase {

        public function testSomeAspect() : void {
            var component:CustomComponent = new CustomComponent();
            component.initialize();
            // set some properties...
            component.validateProperties();

            // Assert some things about component...
        }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is much easier to follow, but it kinda feels like I'm cheating a little either way.  The first case is slamming it into the current Application (which would be the unit test runner shell app), and the latter isn't a "real" environment.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wondering how other people would handle this sort of situation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;A = 01010101

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if(condition1 || condition2 || condition3)

&lt;p&gt;This will check conditions 2 and 3, even if 1 is already true. As your conditions can be quite expensive functions, you can get a good performance boost by using them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one big caveat, NullReferences or similar problems. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if(class != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; class.someVar &amp;lt; 20)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If class is null, the if-statement will stop after "class != null" is false. If you only use &amp;amp;, it will try to check class.someVar and you get a nice NullReferenceException. With the Or-Operator that may not be that much of a trap as it's unlikely that you trigger something bad, but it's something to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one ever uses the single &amp;amp; or | operators though, unless you have a design where each condition is a function that HAS the be executed. Sounds like a design smell, but sometimes (rarely) it's a clean way to do stuff. The &amp;amp; operator does "run these 3 functions, and if one of them returns false, execute the else block", while the | does "only run the else block if none return false" - can be useful, but as said, often it's a design smell.&lt;/p&gt;

The rule of this hierarchy is that every CustID has a ParentID and if the CustID has no parent then the ParentID = CustID and it is the highest level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;DECLARE @LookupID int

--Our test value
SET @LookupID = 1

     WHERE c.CustID &amp;lt;&amp;gt; a.CustomerID

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if tblCustomer looks like this:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ParentID    CustID

5            4
5            5

&lt;p&gt;I'm using the AuthorizeAttributeFilter provided in MVC preview 4. This is returning an HttpUnauthorizedResult. This result is correctly setting the statusCode to 401. The problem, as i understand it, is that asp.net is intercepting the response (since its taged as a 401) and redirecting to the login page instead of just letting it go through. I want to bypass this interception for certain urls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now split the list into two sublists -- one sublist contains all numbers y with y&amp;amp;x == 0, and the rest go in the other sublist.  By the way we chose x, we know that a and b are in different buckets.  We also know that each pair of duplicates is still in the same bucket.  So we can now apply ye olde "XOR-em-all" trick to each bucket independently, and discover what a and b are completely.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You can use Will Dean's suggestion [&lt;code&gt;#define arraysize(ar)  (sizeof(ar) / sizeof(ar[0]))&lt;/code&gt;] to replace the magic number 3 here with arraysize(str_array) -- although I remember there being some special case in which that particular version of arraysize might do Something Bad (sorry I can't remember the details immediately). But it very often works correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case where it doesn't work is when the "array" is really just a pointer, not an actual array. Also, because of the way arrays are passed to functions (converted to a pointer to the first element), it doesn't work across function calls even if the signature looks like an array &amp;mdash; &lt;code&gt;some_function(string parameter[])&lt;/code&gt; is really &lt;code&gt;some_function(string *parameter)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best practice for signing your assemblies is something that is completely dependent on your objectives and needs.  We would need more information like your intended deployment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For personal use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For use on corporate network PC's as a client application&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Sold on a CD in shrink wrap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uploaded straight into a cybernetic brain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally you use code signing to verify that the Assemblies came from a specific trusted source and have not been modified.  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;So each with the same key is fine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Now how that trust and identity is determined is another story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt;  How this benefits your end users when you are deploying over the web is if you have obtained a &lt;a href="http://www.thawte.com/code-signing/index.html?click=main-nav-products-codesigning"&gt;software signing certificate from a certificate authority&lt;/a&gt;.  Then when they download your assemblies they can verify they came from &lt;em&gt;Domenic's Software Emporium&lt;/em&gt;, and they haven't been modified or corrupted along the way.  You will also want to sign the installer when it is downloaded.  This prevents the warning that some browsers display that it has been obtained from an unknown source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note, you will pay for a software signing certificate.  What you get is the certificate authority become the trusted 3rd party who verifies you are who you say you are.  This works because of a web of trust that traces its way back to a root certificate that is installed in their operating system.  There are a few certificate authorities to choose from, but you will want to make sure they are supported by the root certificates on the target operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

It was great!  I learned a little about everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as the care and feeding of your database box, I'd recommend that you do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perform regular full backups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perform regular transaction log backups.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitor your backup jobs. There's a bunch of utilities  out on the market that are relatively cheap that can automate this for you.  In a small shop you're often too busy
to remember to check on them daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Test your backups.  Do a drill.  Restore an old copy of your most important databases.  Prove to yourself that your backups are working and that you know how to restore them properly.  You'd be suprised how many people only think about this during their first real disaster.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Store backups off-site.  With all the online backup providers out there today, there's not much excuse for not having an offsite backup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limit sa access to your boxes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your database platform supports it, use only role based security.  Resist the temptation to have one-off user specific security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic idea here is that if you restrict who has access to the box, you'll have fewer problems.  Secondly, if your backups are solid, there are few things that come up that you won't be able to deal with effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In New Foundations (&lt;strong&gt;NF&lt;/strong&gt;), "&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;" is not a stratified formula, and so again we cannot define the Russell set. Somewhat amusingly, however, &lt;em&gt;V&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a set in &lt;strong&gt;NF&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In von Neumann--Bernays--Gdel set theory (&lt;strong&gt;NBG&lt;/strong&gt;), the class &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; = { &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; : &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; is a set and &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; } is definable. We then ask whether &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;; if so, then also &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;, giving a contradiction. Thus we must have &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;. But there is no contradiction here, since for any given class &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; implies either &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is a proper class. Since &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;, we must simply have that &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; is a proper class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the class &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; = { &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; : &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; }, without the restriction, is simply not definable in &lt;strong&gt;NBG&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

On the negative side, it is not quite feature-complete yet so we are in the unenviable position of maintaining two separate frameworks in parallel until we can port the last of our "front-end" applications.&lt;/p&gt;

Note in particular, you probably don't want to embed the proxy password in the url or the python source code (unless it's just a quick hack).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import urllib2

def get_proxy_opener(proxyurl, proxyuser, proxypass, proxyscheme="http"):
    password_mgr = urllib2.HTTPPasswordMgrWithDefaultRealm()
    password_mgr.add_password(None, proxyurl, proxyuser, proxypass)

    proxy_handler = urllib2.ProxyHandler({proxyscheme: proxyurl})
    proxy_auth_handler = urllib2.ProxyBasicAuthHandler(password_mgr)

    return urllib2.build_opener(proxy_handler, proxy_auth_handler)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    if len(sys.argv) &amp;gt; 4:

&lt;p&gt;In a more complex program, you can seperate these components out as appropriate (for instance, only using one password manager for the lifetime of the application).

For example a &lt;strong&gt;tic-tac-toe&lt;/strong&gt; program can be built as a simple command line program initially that lets two players play the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This step can be used to show how a simple data structure or array can represent the game board, simple input to get user commands/moves, simple output to display the game board and prompts etc. Then you can start showing how an algorithm can be used to allow player vs computer mode. I like the simple magic square math algorithm for &lt;strong&gt;tic-tac-toe&lt;/strong&gt; as it's based on &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; simple math. After this the sky's the limit, UI improvements, using file I/O to load and save games, more advanced algorithms to get the computer to play better etc. More complex and satisfying games can still be produced using text mode or simple graphics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplest game I've used is a number list reversing game. This involves a mixed up list of numbers from 1-9. The player can specify a number of digits to reverse on the left of the list. The aim is to get the list sorted. This is great for absolute beginners. Each little part of the game can be written and tested separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you solved this problem? Do you know of a library that will help me do this? I'm really stuck so whatever you might see here that I just don't right now would be really helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks,

&lt;p&gt;I'm also not sure why you think the fact that this is valid C++ code is helpful when attempting to figure out why it doesn't compile as C? C++ is (largely) a superset of C so there's any number of reasons why valid C++ code might not be syntactically correct C code, not least that C++ treats structs as classes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep a sign bit, which is &lt;code&gt;sign(dividend) ^ sign(divisor)&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Then, call the unsigned division function on the absolute values of both. Then tack the sign back onto the result.&lt;/p&gt;

The inability to delete this DLL in the bin folder of my published Web Service prevents me from publishing successfully (even though it thinks it published successfully!), which makes development and fixing the bug difficult (especially when it just happily runs old code since my changes may not be reflected on the server!). Note that the bug causing the Web Service to bomb and lock up the DLL is in my code, which is outside of said DLL, so I think this is a more general problem than just the FreeImage library (not to bring them any heat).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Has anyone experienced this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a way to make sure that when it says "Publish succeeded" from the VS IDE that it really means it, or to run sort of script to check that the files are really deleted before it attempts to Publish (like a pre-build step in VC++). (Right now I manually delete the files before publishing to make sure that I know the DLLs were replaced, instead of running old DLLs. It's still a problem, though if I can't delete the DLL.)&lt;/li&gt;

purge_object_index_every says that it clears the index every n requests.  Setting this to "1" or "0", seems to clear the index... sometimes.  I'd expect one of those two to work, but for some reason it doesn't do it every time.  More like 1 in 5 times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the whole thing about changing templates place is to put the templates in a designer accessible area, so any modification needed, the designer can load them to his/her computer, edit, and upload it again. I think this is a common scenario. So, probably I am missing something in my research. Maybe I am focusing in configuring it on the wrong place ... Any thoughts ?&lt;/p&gt;

The NoFallBackAuthorize filter checks to see if the user is authorized much like the, included, Authorize filter. It differs in that it returns HttpForbiddenResult when access is denied. &lt;/p&gt;

This is a full-blown page description language and the (deeply unfashionable) other half of the better-known XSLT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly the whole thing is anything but "lightwight", but if you just incorporated a
very limited subset - which could even just be (to match your spec of "paragraph tags, font selection, font size &amp;amp; decoration") &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xsl/#fo_block" rel="nofollow"&gt;fo:block&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xsl/#common-font-properties" rel="nofollow"&gt;common font properties&lt;/a&gt;, something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would perhaps have a few advantages over just rolling your own. There's an open specification to work from, and all that implies. It reuses CSS properties as XML attributes (in a similar manner to SVG), so many of the formatting details will seem somewhat familiar. You'd have an upgrade path if you later decided that, say, intelligent paging was a must-have feature - including more sections of the spec as they become relevant to your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's one other thing you might get from investigating XSL-FO - seeing how even just-doing-paragraphs-and-fonts can be horrendously complicated. Trying to do text layout and line breaking 'The Right Way' for various different languages and use cases seems very daunting to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing the cut-off frequency depends upon your application. Coding these filters can either be done by simulating RC circuits or by playing around with Fourier transforms of your time-based data. See the wikipedia articles for code examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also feels like they've actually spent time trying out a lot of the ways customer's will use their controls. The documentation and support reflects it. They aren't perfect, though. One issue that they had in the past, and that they've addressed in the latest releases (what they were calling their "Prometheus" controls, now just "Rad Controls for ASP.NET AJAX") is the performance of the controls. In previous releases they were definitely a bit sluggish (I'm thinking specifically of their RadGrid and RadEditor).

&lt;p&gt;In the above, the first part of the command should be displayed, and the cursor should be at the end of the line, but it isn't.  You literally can't see what you're editing when this happens. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with the Ruby One Click installer so you have a sane installation of ruby and rubygems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, you install the rails gem and the gem for your database like you normally would. Most if not all of the databases have Windows gems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure to install mongrel_service to be able to control each mongrel like a normal windows service. See &lt;code&gt;mongrel_rails service::install -h&lt;/code&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have your mongrels set up, it's similar to a UNIX deployment. You set up a reverse proxy, such as Apache2 and you're set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might run into some gems (such as &lt;a href="http://backgroundrb.rubyforge.org/"&gt;BackgroundRB&lt;/a&gt;) that will not work under Windows because they have C code that either rely on UNIX libraries or expect a UNIX-like build system at installation time. However, all of the really important Rails gems, such as Mongrel and the database adapters, have gems with pre-built binaries available, so you'll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Windows, a file name is directly attached to the file data. This means that the OS prevents somebody from deleting a file that is currently open. On some versions of Windows you can rename a file that is currently open, and on some versions you can't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Unix, a file name is a pointer to an inode, which is the place the file data is actually stored. This has a couple of implications:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can have two different filenames that refer to the same underlying file. This is often called a &lt;em&gt;hard link&lt;/em&gt;. There is only one copy of the file data, so changes made through one filename will appear in the other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can delete (also known as &lt;code&gt;unlink&lt;/code&gt;) a file that is currently open. All that happens is the directory entry is removed, but this doesn't affect any other process that might still have the file open. The process with the file open hangs on to the inode, rather than to the directory entry. When the process closes the file, the OS deletes the inode because there are no more directory entries pointing at it and no more processes with the inode open.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This difference is important, but it is unrelated to things like the performance of &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest difference between the two operating systems is that Unix essentially treats all of the physical drives as one logical drive. (This isn't exactly how it works, but should give a good enough picture.) This allows a much simpler file system from the users perspective as there are no drive letters to deal with. I have a folder called /usr/bin that could span multiple physical drives. If I need to expand that partition I can do so by adding a new drive, remapping the folder, and moving the files. (Again, somewhat simplified, but it gets the point across.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other difference is that when you format a drive, a certain amount is set aside (by default, as an admin you can change the size to 0 if you want) for use by the "root" account (admin account) which allows an admin to almost always be able to log in to the machine even when the user has filled the disk and is receiving "out of disk space" messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people say that UNIX file systems are better, they might mean to be saying, "Oh ext3 stores bits in such as way that corruption happens way less than NTFS", but they might also be talking about design choices made at the common layer above. They might be referring to how the path of the file does not necessarily correspond to any particular device. For example, if you move your program files to a second disk, you probably have to refer to them as "D:\Program Files", while in UNIX /usr/bin could be a hard drive, a network drive, a CD ROM, or RAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that people are using "file system" to mean the organization of paths. Like, for instance, how Windows generally likes programs in "C:\Program Files\CompanyName\AppName" while a particular UNIX distribution might put most of them in /usr/local/bin. In the later case, you can access much more of your system readily from the command line with a much smaller PATH variable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, since you mentioned grep, if all the source code for system libraries such as the kernel and libc is stored in /usr/local/src, doing a recursive grep for a particular error message coming from the guts of some system library is much simpler than if things were laid out as /usr/local/library-name/[bin|src|doc|etc]. If you already have an inkling of where you're searching, though, cygwin grep performs quite well under Windows. In fact, I find for full-text searching I get better results from grep than the search facilities built into Windows!&lt;/p&gt;

We use Perforce and have typically have several lines of development.

&lt;p&gt;There is integration cost to the merging and catching up to new features rolled into the trunk, but you're going to suffer this pain anyway.  Having everyone develop on the trunk together can lead to a wild west situation, while branching allows you to scale and choose the points at which you'd like to take the bitter integration pills.  We're currently scaled to over a hundred developers on a dozen projects, each with multiple releases using the same core components, and it works pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;

As Sean stated, once you have candidate terms, it's not to difficult to search for those terms with some of the other entities in context and then use the results of that search to determine how confident you are that the term extracted is an actual entity of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/"&gt;OpenNLP&lt;/a&gt; is a great project if you'd like to play around with natural language processing.  The capabilities you've named would probably be best accomplished with Named Entity Recognizers (NER) (algorithms that locate proper nouns, generally, and sometimes dates as well) and/or Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) (eg: the word 'bank' has different meanings depending on it's context, and that can be very important when extracting information from text.  Given the sentences: "the plane banked left", "the snow bank was high", and "they robbed the bank" you can see how dissambiguation can play an important part in language understanding)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Techniques generally build on each other, and NER is one of the more complex tasks, so to do NER successfully, you will generally need accurate tokenizers (natural language tokenizers, mind you -- statistical approaches tend to fare the best), string stemmers (algorithms that conflate similar words to common roots: so words like informant and informer are treated equally), sentence detection ('Mr. Jones was tall.' is only one sentence, so you can't just check for punctuation), part-of-speech taggers (POS taggers), and WSD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a python port of (parts of) OpenNLP called NLTK (&lt;a href="http://nltk.sourceforge.net"&gt;http://nltk.sourceforge.net&lt;/a&gt;) but I don't have much experience with it yet.  Most of my work has been with the Java and C# ports, which work well.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these algorithms are language-specific, of course, and they can take significant time to run (although, it is generally faster than reading the material you are processing).  Since the state-of-the-art is largely based on statistical techniques, there is also a considerable error rate to take into account.  Furthermore, because the error rate impacts all the stages, and something like NER requires numerous stages of processing, (tokenize -&gt; sentence detect -&gt; POS tag -&gt; WSD -&gt; NER) the error rates compound.&lt;/p&gt;

Multiple teams working in parallel won't be able to work effectively all on the same code (trunk).  If you have just a small group of people working and your main concern is cutting a branch so you can continue to work while going back to the branch for making bug-fixes to the current production code that would work. This is a trivial use of branching and not too burdensome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a lots of parallel development you'll want to have branches for each of the efforts but that'll also require more discipline:  Making sure your branches are tested and ready to merge back.  Scheduling merges so two groups aren't trying to merge at the same time etc.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some branches are under development for so long that you have to permit merges  from the trunk to the branch in order to reduce the number of surprises when finally merging back to the trunk.&lt;/p&gt;

This is probably going to be beyond your need, but this will help others that find this page via search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you do not need the process to run with a GUI and you do not require elevation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the user you want to run as is already logged into a session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you need to run the process with a GUI, and the user may, or may not be logged in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you need to run the process with elevation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regarding 1:&lt;/strong&gt;
In windows Vista there exists something called session 0 isolation.  All services run as session 0 and you are not supposed to have a GUI in session 0.  The first logged on user is logged into session 1.  In previous versions of windows (pre Vista), the first logged on user was also ran fully in session 0.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can run several different processes with different usernames in the same session.  You can find a good document about session 0 isolation &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/vista/services.mspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we're dealing with option 1), you don't need a GUI.  Therefore you can start your process in session 0. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll want a call sequence something like this:
LogonUser, ExpandEnvironmentStringsForUser, GetLogonSID, LoadUserProfile, CreateEnvironmentBlock, CreateProcessAsUser. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example code for this can be found via any search engine, or via &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/codesearch"&gt;Google code search&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regarding 2:&lt;/strong&gt;  If the user you'd like to run the process as is already logged in, you can simply use: WTSEnumerateSessions, and WTSQuerySessionInformation to get the session ID, and then WTSQueryUserToken to get the user token.  From there you can just use the user token in the CreateProcessAsUser Win32 API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great method because you don't even need to login as the user nor know the user's username/password.  I believe this is only possible via a service though running as local system account. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get the current session via WTSGetActiveConsoleSessionId.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regarding 3:&lt;/strong&gt;
You would follow the same steps as #1, but in addition you would use the STARTUPINFO's lpDesktop field.  Set this to winsta0\Default.  You will also need to try to use the OpenDesktop Win32 API and if this fails you can CreateDesktop.  Before using the station and desktop handles you should use SetSecurityInfo on each of them with SE_WINDOW_OBJECT, and GROUP_SECURITY_INFORMATION | DACL_SECURITY_INFORMATION.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the user in question later tries to login, he will actually see the running process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regarding 4:&lt;/strong&gt;
This can be done as well, but it requires you to already be running an elevated process.  A service running as local system account does run as elevated.  I could also only get it to work by having an authenticode signed process that I wanted to start.   The process you want to start also must have a manifest file associated with it with the requestedExecutionLevel level="requireAdministrator"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can set a token's session via SetTokenInformation and TokenSessionId&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You cannot change the session ID of an already running process. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This whole process would be drastically more simple if Vista was not in the equation. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switching to mongrel is a good first step, but there's more to do. It's a bad idea to cull from web services on live pages, particularly from Rails. Rails is not thread-safe. The number of concurrent connections you can support equals the number of mongrels (or Passenger processes) in your cluster. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have one mongrel and someone accesses a page that calls a web service that takes 10 seconds to time out, every request to your website will timeout during that time. Most of the load balancers just cycle through your mongrels blindly, so if you have two mongrels, every other request will timeout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything that can be unpredictably slow needs to happen in a job queue. The first hit to /slow/action adds the job to the queue, and /slow/action keeps on refreshing via page refreshes or queries via ajax until the job is finished, and then you get your results from the job queue.  There are a few job queues for Rails nowadays, but the oldest and probably most widely used one is &lt;a href="http://backgroundrb.rubyforge.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;BackgroundRB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another alternative, depending on the nature of your app, is to cull the service every N minutes via cron, cache the data locally, and have your live page read from the cache. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to which method is better is highly dependent on your exact situation, but I will write what my overall experience has shown so far. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The better method overall (in my experience): The trunk should be always stable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some guidelines and benefits of this method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code each task (or related set of tasks) in its own branch, then you will have the flexibility of when you would like to merge these tasks and perform a release.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;QA should be done on each branch before it is merged to the trunk. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By doing QA on each individual branch, you will know exactly what caused the bug easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This solution scales to any number of developers.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This method works since branching is an almost instant operation in SVN.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tag each release that you perform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can develop features that you don't plan to release for a while and decide exactly when to merge them.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For all work you do, you can have the benefit of committing your code.  If you work out of the trunk only, you will probably keep your code uncommitted a lot, and hence unprotected and without automatic history. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you try to do the opposite and do all your development in the trunk you'll have the following issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constant build problems for daily builds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Productivity loss when a a developer commits a problem for all other people on the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Longer release cycles, because you need to finally get a stable version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less stable releases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You simply will not have the flexibility that you need if you try to keep a branch stable and the trunk as the development sandbox.  The reason is that you can't pick and chose from the trunk what you want to put in that stable release.  It would already be all mixed in together in the trunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one case in particular that I would say to do all development in the trunk, is when you are starting a new project.  There may be other cases too depending on your situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way distributed version control systems provide much more flexibility and I highly recommend switching to either hg or git.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They're different beasts. WHS backup is pretty much automatic and uses deltas - Vista's is manual and I don't believe offers incremental updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While your solution (Vista + network copy) would preserve your data it has two problems I an see;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your documents will only have the latest revision. If you find something was corrupted a month ago it could be very awkward to recover it. Vista's shadow copies may help though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As soon as you install a program/patch/config your Vista backup is out of date and needs remade, or these repeated if you reinstall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These might not be dealbreakers and indeed Vista's backup is pretty decent, it's just nowhere near as good as WHS. In my opinion WHS leaves almost everything else standing, you can be sure this tech will be in the "big brother" server versions shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

It's almost like a virtual world where you have agents that are able to observe, communicate, and react. To give an example, you might have a memory allocation agent that you have to ask for memory and it decides whether or not to give it to you. Or you might have an agent that monitors a web server and restarts it if it hangs. The main goal behind multiagent systems is to have a more Smalltalk-like communication system between different parts of the system in order to get everything to work together, as opposed to more top-down directives that come from a central program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I just downloaded the application and looked at the files. It does appear to have binaries for all 3 platforms in one directory. If your concern is in how to write apps that can be moved from machine to machine without losing settings, you should probably write all your configuration to a file in the same directory as the executable and not touch the Windows registry or create any dot directories in the home folder of the user that's running the program on Linux or Mac. And as far as creating a cross-distribution Linux binary, 32-bit POSIX/X11 would probably be the safest bet. I'm not sure what JungleDisk uses as I'm currently on a Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can certainly write cross-platform C code, you just have to be aware of the differences between platforms, and test, test, test. Unit tests and a CI (continuous integration) solution will go a long way toward making sure your program works across all your target platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good approach is to isolate the system-dependent stuff in one or a few modules at most. Provide a system-independent interface from that module. Then build everything else on top of that module, so it doesn't depend on the system you're compiling for.&lt;/p&gt;

The library didn't have any GUI components, which made it easier.  We ended up abstracting out into dedicated source files any routine that was not consistent across platforms, and used #defines where appropriate in those source files.  This kept the code that was adjusted per platform isolated away from the main business logic of the library.  We also made extensive use of typedefs and our own dedicated types so that we could easily change them per platform if needed.  This made the port to 64-bit platforms fairly easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our other option is to create some middle ground where we use subsonic to query and load up arbitrary objects with their "execute as typed list" functionality that does a name based mapping off of an arbitrary linq style sql statement. Or to try and recreate some of it in nhibernate and refactor the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I say subsonic makes sense in small apps, but maintenance on subsonic apps gets pretty hairy, we have especially hard times with overlapping validation code, and pre/post in code triggered events. For an active record pattern, subsonic is definitely 80% there, but does somethings in a flaky way, and stops you from having any real control over your inheritance hierarchy, since every class must inherit a table to get back to that table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multi-agents don't have to be on different machines, they could as @Kyle says, be multiple processes on a single chip or machine, but they act without explicit centralised direction. They might act in concert, so they have certain synchronisation rules - doing their jobs separately before coming together to compare results, for example. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally though the reasoning behind the segmentation into separate agents is to allow for differing priorities to guide each agent's actions and reactions. Perhaps using an economic model to divide up common resources or because the different functions are physically separated so don't need to interact tightly with each other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;sweeping generalisation&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
Is it something to ignore? Well it's not really anything in particular so it's a little like "can I ignore the concept of quicksort?" If you don't understand what quicksort is then you're not going to fail to be a developer because most of your life will be totally unaffected. If you have more understanding of different architectures and models, you'll have more knowledge to deploy in new and unpredictable places.
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;sweeping generalisation&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, 'multi-agent systems' (MAS) was one of those phrases that appeared everywhere in the academic literature. These days it is less prevalent, but some of the ideas it represents are &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; useful in some places. But totally unnecessary in others. So I hope that's clear ;) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(out of 170,000 hits on a Google search for "monad tutorial"!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Stu: The point of monads is to allow you to add (usually) sequential semantics to otherwise pure code; you can even compose monads (using Monad Transformers) and get more interesting and complicated combined semantics, like parsing with error handling, shared state, and logging, for example. All of this is possible in pure code, monads just allow you to abstract it away and reuse it in modular libraries (always good in programming), as well as providing convenient syntax to make it look imperative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haskell already has operator overloading[1]: it uses type classes much the way one might use interfaces in Java or C# but Haskell just happens to also allow non-alphanumeric tokens like + &amp;amp;&amp;amp; and &gt; as infix identifiers. It's only operator overloading in your way of looking at it if you mean "overloading the semicolon" [2]. It sounds like black magic and asking for trouble to "overload the semicolon" (picture enterprising Perl hackers getting wind of this idea) but the point is that without monads &lt;i&gt;there is no semicolon, since purely functional code does not require or allow explicit sequencing.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all sounds much more complicated than it needs to. sigfpe's article is pretty cool but uses Haskell to explain it, which sort of fails to break the chicken and egg problem of understanding Haskell to grok Monads and understanding Monads to grok Haskell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] This is a separate issue from monads but monads use Haskell's operator overloading feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[2] This is also an oversimplification since the operator for chaining monadic actions is &gt;&gt;= (pronounced "bind") but there is syntactic sugar ("do") that lets you use braces and semicolons and/or indentation and newlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea with ProcessExplorer sounds promising. Does anyone know an API that could be used for listing events for a process? And, does it work without administrative rights?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for the clarification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is not really a master process. It is more of a driver dll that is used from different processes and the events would be used to "lock" resources used by these processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am thinking about setting up a central service that has sufficient access rights even under Vista. It will certainly complicate things, but it might be the only thing left facing the problems with security.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Cons: as a dynamic language, has way
  worse IDE support (proper syntax
  completion requires static typing,
  whether explicit in Java or inferred
  in SML),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are right, that static analysis may not provide full syntax completion for dynamic languages, but I thing pydev gets the job done very well. Further more I have a different development style when programming python. I have always an ipython session open and with one F5 I do not only get the perfect completion from ipython, but object introspection and manipulation as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But if you want to write second Google
  or Yahoo, you will be much better with
  C# or Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are basically right about it being sort of like an abstract Tree class with three derived classes (Empty, Leaf, and Node), but you would also need to enforce the guarantee that some one using your Tree class can never add any new derived classes, since the strategy for using the Tree datat type is to write code that switches at runtime based on the type of each element in the tree (and adding new derived types would break existing code). You can sort of imagine this getting nasty in C# or C++, but in Haskell, ML, and OCaml, this is central to the language design and syntax so coding style supports it in a much more convenient manner, via pattern matching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ADT (sum types) are also sort of like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union" rel="nofollow"&gt;tagged unions&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_type" rel="nofollow"&gt;variant types&lt;/a&gt; in C or C++.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for some larger Python projects I've tackled, I'm finding that it's not quite the same as programming in say, C++. I was working on a language parser, and needed to represent an AST in Python. This is certainly within the scope of what Python can do, but I had a bit of trouble with some refactoring. I was changing the representation of my AST and changing methods and classes around a lot, and I found I missed the strong typing that would be available to me in a C++ solution. Python's duck typing was almost &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; flexible and I found myself adding a lot of &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; code to try to check my types as the program ran. And then I couldn't really be sure that everything was properly typed unless I had 100% code coverage testing (which I didn't at the time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, that's another thing that I miss sometimes. It's possible to write syntactically correct code in Python that simply won't run. The compiler is incapable of telling you about it until it actually executes the code, so in infrequently-used code paths such as error handlers you can easily have unseen bugs lurking around. Even code that's as simple as printing an error message with a % format string can fail at runtime because of mismatched types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven't used Python for any GUI stuff so I can't comment on that aspect.&lt;/p&gt;

There's not a lot of extraneous syntax getting in the way of your thought processes, so most of the work you do tends to go into the code. (There's far less idioms required to be involved in writing good Python code than in writing good C++.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this, most Python (CPython) programmers ascribe to the "premature optimization is the root of all evil" philosophy. By writing high-level (and significantly slower) Python code, one can optimize the bottlenecks out using C/C++ bindings when your application is nearing completion. At this point it becomes more clear what your processor-intensive algorithms are through proper profiling. This way, you write most of the code in a very readable and maintainable manner while allowing for speedups down the road. You'll see several Python library modules written in C for this very reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most graphics libraries in Python (i.e. wxPython) are just Python wrappers around C++ libraries anyway, so you're pretty much writing to a C++ backend.&lt;/p&gt;

It's the best language ever!) and the other religious one (you gotta be kidding me! Python? No... it's not mature enough). I will maybe skip the last religion (Python?! Use Ruby!). The truth, as always, is far from obvious. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;: it's easy, readable, batteries included, has lots of good libraries for pretty much everything. It's expressive and dynamic typing makes it more concise in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;: as a dynamic language, has way worse IDE support (proper syntax completion &lt;strong&gt;requires&lt;/strong&gt; static typing, whether explicit in Java or inferred in SML), its object system is far from perfect (interfaces, anyone?) and it is easy to end up with messy code that has methods returning either int or boolean or object or some sort under unknown circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My take &amp;ndash; I love Python for scripting, automation, tiny webapps and other simple well defined tasks. In my opinion it is by far &lt;strong&gt;the best&lt;/strong&gt; dynamic language on the planet. That said, I would &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; use it &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; dynamically typed language to develop an application of substantial size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say &amp;ndash; it would be fine to use it for Stack Overflow, which has three developers and I guess no more than 30k lines of code. For bigger things &amp;ndash; first your development would be super fast, and then once team and codebase grow things are slowing down more than they would with Java or C#. You need to offset lack of compilation time checks by writing more unittests, refactorings get harder cause you never know what your refacoring broke until you run all tests or even the whole big app, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now &amp;ndash; decide on how big your team is going to be and how big the app is supposed to be once it is done. If you have 5 or less people and the target size is roughly Stack Overflow, go ahead, write in Python. You will finish in no time and be happy with good codebase. But if you want to write second Google or Yahoo, you will be much better with C# or Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side-note on C/C++ you have mentioned: if you are not writing performance critical software (say massive parallel raytracer that will run for three months rendering a film) or a very mission critical system (say Mars lander that will fly three years straight and has only one chance to land right or you lose $400mln) do not use it. For web apps, most desktop apps, most apps in general it is not a good choice. You will die debugging pointers and memory allocation in complex business logic.&lt;/p&gt;

This makes accurate recording of elapsed time pretty painless and about as accurate as you can get, which in turn improves FogBugz predictive powers in its evidence-based scheduling.  Also, when soloing, I find that such specific logging of my time keeps me on task, in the way a meandering manager otherwise might. (I'm not affiliated with TimeSprite in any way.)&lt;/p&gt;

I can agree that the second version is shorter, but I'm not sure that I think it's easier to follow. The test does a lot of things that you wouldn't normally do, whereas the first example is more true to how you would use the component outside the test environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That way you also save space on your filesystem, as you are only going to save the exact amount of space, or even compacted space on the filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Linor: That's essentially what you would do after creating a Voronoi diagram. But instead of making a rectangular grid, you can choose dividing lines that closely match the lines of the Voronoi diagram (this way you will get fewer areas that cross dividing lines). If you recursively divide your Voronoi diagram in half along the best dividing line for each subdiagram, you can then do a tree search for each point you want to look up. This requires a bit of work up front but saves time later. Each lookup would be on the order of log N where N is the number of points. 16 comparisons is a lot better than 15,000!&lt;/p&gt;

Nevertheless, there are ways to enforce and encourage better bug reporting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most bug tracking software have a way of marking some fields of the bug report as mandatory, so that the reporter has to actually choose the appropriate value in order to successfully create the bug&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is usually a possibility to include a basic template for the bug report, something in the lines of&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Actual Results:&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Remarks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can (and should) provide a bug-reporting tool that will be run on the problematic machine, gather the relevant information and pack it into an archive file (and maybe place it on the desktop). You then instruct your staff to run it whenever they encounter a bug they wish to report and attach the archive to the bug. This tool should be easy to use (just running an executable) so that they would attach the diagnostics information to any bug without having to think if it is relevant or not. This tool is usually also very useful with customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last but not least - "education, education, education". People learn the best from experience - just make sure that whenever someone opens a bug without the proper information included, the person handling the bug would go and talk to the one who opened the bug, and explain what is missing and why it is important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are practices we have been using quite successfully in my current workplace and I believe them to be quite universal to fit to most working environments.&lt;/p&gt;

I'd try and see if the system has any way to enforce that certain fields that you require are entered, try and have whatever bugs that are critical coming across your eyes somehow (email, rss) so you can pounce quickly, but mostly that your team is aware of the quality standard and keep to it, guidelines are published and public, that sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming it's your team:
If you can have a certain structure that is used every time in a comments field, of what is expected when it is entered, then that would be good too - even better if your software has a default notes outline where you can define that structure on a blank form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To some degree though, it's up to the individual, they have to be aware that it's part of the communication standards, it's expected as a job requirement, and that they're responsible to every other member of the team - because other people shouldn't be in a position of hunting them down to find out any further details if it could be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially since the turnaround time on fixing bugs on lower priority items could be some time and people are bound to be forgetful on the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming it's users:
You can't to a high degree, but I'd try - if possible, to ask questions on whatever form in a way that people could understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not entirely on this topic, but in a "how you ask the questions" kind of way, is this post on 37 Signals blog - &lt;a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1111-design-decisions-basecamp-support-request-form" rel="nofollow" title="Design Decisions - Support Request Form"&gt;link text&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you have to have another form asking the questions visible to your users, that only feeds mostly the data to bug program, I'd do it just to ask the right questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What product?  What version (pictures showing how to find it)?  It'd be helpful to include a screen dump, if they could open the program and press a button to send through a log file automatically, whether it stopped them from doing further work, whether it lost their changes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the users it's probably more about how you ask the questions, and letting them know that you require certain ones to be answered, or which ones you'd find more helpful, then you'd probably get better responses.&lt;/p&gt;

I would suggest that you look into the enterprise library exception and logging application block (&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc467894.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc467894.aspx&lt;/a&gt;). There is a wee bit of a learning curve but it does work quite well. The approach I favour at the moment is to define 4 priority levels. 4=Unhandled exception (error in event log), 3=Handled exception (warning in event log), 2=Access an external resource such as a webservice, db or mainframe system (information in event log), 1=Verbose/anything else of interest (information in event log).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the application block it's then quite easy to tweak what level of priority you want to log. So in development you'd log everything but as you get a stable system in production, you'd probably only be interested in unhandled exceptions and possibly handled exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: For clarity, I would suggest you have logging in both your winform/wpf app and your webservices. In a web scenario, I've had problems in the past where it can be difficult to tie an error on the client back through to the app servers. Mainly because any error through webservices gets wrapped up as a SOAP exception. I can't remember off the top of my head, but I think if you use a custom exception handler (that is part of the enterprise library) you can add data onto exceptions such as the handlinginstance id of the exception from the app server. This makes it easier to tie up exceptions on a client back to your app box by using LogParser (&lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=890cd06b-abf8-4c25-91b2-f8d975cf8c07&amp;amp;displaylang=en" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=890cd06b-abf8-4c25-91b2-f8d975cf8c07&amp;amp;displaylang=en&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second Update&lt;/strong&gt;: I also like to give each different event a seperate event id and to track that in a text file or spreadsheet under source control. Yes, its a pain but if you're lucky enough to have an IT team looking after your systems in production, I find they tend to expect different events to have different event ids.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Is it better to go all the way and log everything across multiple attempts/days, or log only what you need to (given hdd is cheap).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact harddrives are cheap really isn't a good reason to verbosely log everything possible, for a few reasons.. For one, with a very busy application, you really don't want to slow it down and tie up disc-writes writing logs (harddrives are pretty slow). The second point, and the more important one - there's really very little to gain from terabytes worth of logs.. For development, they can are useful, but you don't need to keep more than a few minutes of them..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some logging is of course useful, having different levels is about the only way to go about it - for example debug() info() only get logged if requested (in a config, or command line flag), then maybe warning() and error() get sent to a log file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of the things I've written (smallish scripts) I generally just have a debug() function, that checks if --verbose is set, and prints the message.. That way I can shove debug("some value: %s" % (avar)) when needed, and not have to worry about going back and removing debugging print() statements everwhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For web applications, I generally just use the web-server logs for statistics, and the error log. I use things like mod_rewrite's log when needed, but it would be idiotic to leave this enabled beyond development (as it creates many many lines on each page request)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose it depends on the application itself, but generally, for big applications use multiple levels of logs that can be activated when needed. For smaller things, a --verbose flag or equivalent, for web applications, log errors and (to a point) log hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, in "production" log only the information you can use, in development log everything you could possible need to fix problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why should configuration files and registry keys fail on Vista? Of course, you have to get the security settings right -- but you would have to do that for your named events as well -- so there should not be a big difference here. Maybe you should tell us some more details about the nature of your processes -- do they all run within the same logon session or do they run as different users even? And is there some master process or who creates the events in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I tend to find the Process Explorer idea to be not a very good one. Despite the fact that you probably will not be able to accomplish that without using undocumented APIs and/or a device driver, I do not think that a process should be spelunking around in the handle table of another process just to find out the names of some kernel objects. And, of course, the same security issues apply again.&lt;/p&gt;

The basic idea is to use a spatial partitioning technique to reduce the complexity from O(n) per query to (approximately) O( log n ) per query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KD-Trees, and variants of KD-Trees seem to work very well, but quad-trees will also work. The quality of these searches depends on whether your set of 15,000 data points are static (you're not adding a-lot of data points to the reference set). Mount and Arya's work on the &lt;a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/ANN/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Approximate Nearest Neighbour&lt;/a&gt; library is both easy to use and understand, even without a good grounding in the math.
