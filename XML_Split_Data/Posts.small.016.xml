Even if it hasn't, there is always the risk of somebody using an old version of the client, using a competing or modified version of the client, or just of the net connection being a bit screwy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while you do as much work on the client as possible, processing and marshalling information into the right form, the server then needs to do a thorough sanity check on anything the client gives it.&lt;/p&gt;

If you're doing it a thousand times on a server, constructing a bitmap lookup table would be faster, either giving the result directly or as a first stage of. 2GB of bitmap can map the whole world lat-lon to a 32bit value at 0.011 degree pixels (1.2km at equator), and should fit into memory. If you're only doing single country, or can exclude the poles, you can have a smaller map or higher resolution. For 15,000 points you probably have a much smaller map - I first sized it up as a first step to doing lat-lon to postcode searches, which needs higher resolution. Depending on requirements, you use the mapped value to point at the result directly, or to short list of the candidates (which would allow a smaller map, but requires greater subsequent processing - you're not in O(1) lookup territory any more). &lt;/p&gt;

By logging to the event log, you make it much more likely that warnings or errors can be found and addressed by the admin staff before they become a major problem (if it is a issue they can address), or allows them to get in contact with the devs, who can use the trace logs to further troubleshoot the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest pain point in supporting a custom .NET app right now is that there are 8 different applications (some console apps, some winforms, and some web) from the same vendor.  None of them log to the event log, they all have their own custom log files.  But for all the winforms and console apps, they keep the file open while they are running, so I can't monitor it for issues.  Also, the logs are all written slightly differently, so I would have to parse them a bit differently to get useful information.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This forces me to monitor the appearance of an application (is it responding on the ports it is active on, is the process working set getting too high, etc..), rather than what the state of the application really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, please consider the folks who maintain your application after it is deployed and provide logging they can use. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

I really love it as a language, it just sort of 'feels' right and seems to allow you to produce some succint elegant code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm interested in finding some really nice 'wow factor' snippets of F# code which demonstate the elegence of the language, especially compared to C#. For example I really like:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
#light
let ListProduct l = List.fold_left (*) 1 l
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which inputs a list of ints and multiplies each element in the list, i.e. obtains the product of the list (e.g. a list of 1,2,3 would be calculated as 1*2*3=6). The closest C# equivilent, using LINQ and functional concepts is as follows:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

...

public static class ListHelper {
  public static int ListProduct(List&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; l) {
    return l.Aggregate(1, (i, j) =&amp;gt; i * j);
  }
}    
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before LINQ that would have been:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

...

public static class ListHelper {
  public static int ListProduct(List&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; l) {
    int ret = 1;
    foreach (int i in l) ret *= i;
    return ret;
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm certainly not trying to criticise C# here, I think it's a wonderful language, it's just nice to see how F# compares and to see how it can do some things more elegantly - does anyone have anything really nice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A modicum of security by obscurity - it's slightly more work to tamper with POST submissions than GET&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caching and resubmit rules are more restrictive for POST than GET. I'm not entirely sure this would matter for the OpenID use case, though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bots wouldn't follow the POST form, but would follow the redirect. This could impact server load. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different browsers have different max lengths for GET requests - but none of them are as large as POST.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some browsers will warn on redirect to another domain. They'll also warn if you're submitting POST to a non-HTTPS url.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By turning JavaScript off, I can have a relatively secure experience, and not be silently redirected to another domain.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CPPUnitLite&lt;/em&gt; was created by Michael Feathers, who originally ported Java's JUnit to C++ as CPPUnit (CPPUnit tries mimic the development model of JUnit - but C++ lacks Java's features [e.g. reflection] to make it easy to use). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CPPUnitLite attempts to make a true C++-style testing framework, not a Java one ported to C++. (I'm paraphrasing from Feather's &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0131177052"&gt;Working Effectively with Legacy Code&lt;/a&gt; book). &lt;em&gt;CPPUnitLite2&lt;/em&gt; seems to be another rewrite, with more features and bug fixes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also just stumbled across &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/unittest-cpp/"&gt;UnitTest++&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; which includes stuff from CPPUnitLite2 and some other framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has released &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc136757.aspx"&gt;WinUnit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (via MSDN magazine).

I was already thinking this was too good to be true when I saw this in the &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Syncdb will not alter existing tables&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;syncdb will only create tables for models which have not yet been installed. It will never issue ALTER TABLE statements to match changes made to a model class after installation. Changes to model classes and database schemas often involve some form of ambiguity and, in those cases, Django would have to guess at the correct changes to make. There is a risk that critical data would be lost in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;If you have made changes to a model and wish to alter the database tables to match, use the sql command to display the new SQL structure and compare that to your existing table schema to work out the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that altering existing tables will have to be done "by hand".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I would like to know is the best way to do this. Two solutions come to mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the documentation suggests, make the changes manually in the DB;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a backup of the database, wipe it, create the tables again (with syncdb, since now it's creating the tables from scratch) and import the backed-up data (this might take too long if the database is big)&lt;/li&gt;

You can use INSERT DELAYED in MySQL (or similar constructs in other databases), which returns immediately.

&lt;p&gt;By using INSERT DELAYED, you won't slow down your app to much because of the logging. The database is free to write the INSERTs to disk at any time, so it can bundle a bunch of inserts together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to watch out for using MySQL's built in timestamp function (like CURRENT_TIMESTAMP or CUR_DATE()), because they will be called whenever the query is actually executed. So you should make sure that any time data is generated in your programming language, and not by the database. (This paragraph might be MySQL-specific)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is inefficient for sparse enumerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the enumeration is not dense, you can use an array of structs to hold the mapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second approach is very flexible, but it does mean a search through the mapping every time you need to use the data. For large data sets consider a b-tree or hash instead of an array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either method can be generalized to connect more data. In the first use an array of structs, in the second just add more members to the struct.&lt;/p&gt;

I've built a grammar to parse some text and it works well.  However, when the parser comes across an illegal or unexpected token, it throws one of many exceptions.  The problem is that in some cases (not all) that my try/catch block won't catch it and instead stops execution as an unhandled exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue for me is that I can't replicate this issue anywhere else but in my full code.  The call stack shows that the exception definitely occurs within my try/catch(Exception) block.  The only thing I can think of is that there are a few ANTLR assembly calls that occur between my code and the code throwing the exception and this library does not have debugging enabled, so I can't step through it.  I wonder if non-debuggable assemblies inhibit exception bubbling?  The call stack looks like this; external assembly calls are in Antlr.Runtime:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    Expl.Itinerary.dll!TimeDefLexer.mTokens() Line 1213 C#
    Antlr3.Runtime.dll!Antlr.Runtime.Lexer.NextToken() + 0xfc bytes 
    Antlr3.Runtime.dll!Antlr.Runtime.CommonTokenStream.FillBuffer() + 0x22c bytes   
    Antlr3.Runtime.dll!Antlr.Runtime.CommonTokenStream.LT(int k = 1) + 0x68 bytes
    Expl.Itinerary.dll!TimeDefParser.prog() Line 109 + 0x17 bytes   C#
    Expl.Itinerary.dll!Expl.Itinerary.TDLParser.Parse(string Text = "", Expl.Itinerary.IItinerary Itinerary = {Expl.Itinerary.MemoryItinerary}) Line 17 + 0xa bytes C#
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code snippet from the bottom-most call in Parse() looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;     try {
        // Execution stopped at parser.prog()
        TimeDefParser.prog_return prog_ret = parser.prog();
        return prog_ret == null ? null : prog_ret.value;
     }
     catch (Exception ex) {
        throw new ParserException(ex.Message, ex);
     }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, a catch (Exception) clause should've captured any exception whatsoever.  Is there any reason why it wouldn't?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I traced through the external assembly with Reflector and found no evidence of threading whatsoever.  The assembly seems to just be a runtime utility class for ANTLR's generated code.  The exception thrown is from the TimeDefLexer.mTokens() method and its type is NoViableAltException, which derives from RecognitionException -&gt; Exception.  This exception is thrown when the lexer cannot understand the next token in the stream; in other words, invalid input.  This exception is SUPPOSED to happen, however it should've been caught by my try/catch block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the rethrowing of ParserException is really irrelevant to this situation.  That is a layer of abstraction that takes any exception during parse and convert to my own ParserException.  The exception handling problem I'm experiencing is never reaching that line of code.  In fact, I commented out the "throw new ParserException" portion and still received the same result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more thing, I modified the original try/catch block in question to instead catch NoViableAltException, eliminating any inheritance confusion.  I still received the same result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone once suggested that sometimes VS is overactive on catching handled exceptions when in debug mode, but this issue also happens in release mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man, I'm still stumped!  I hadn't mentioned it before, but I'm running VS 2008 and all my code is 3.5.  The external assembly is 2.0.  Also, some of my code subclasses a class in the 2.0 assembly.  Could a version mismatch cause this issue?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2:&lt;/strong&gt; I was able to eliminate the .NET version conflict by porting relevant portions of my .NET 3.5 code to a .NET 2.0 project and replicate the same scenario.  I was able to replicate the same unhandled exception when running consistently in .NET 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that ANTLR has recently released 3.1.  So, I upgraded from 3.0.1 and retried.  It turns out the generated code is a little refactored, but the same unhandled exception occurs in my test cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 3:&lt;/strong&gt;
I've replicated this scenario in a &lt;a href="http://www.explodingcoder.com/cms/files/TestAntlr-3.1.zip"&gt;simplified VS 2008 project&lt;/a&gt;.  Feel free to download and inspect the project for yourself.  I've applied all the great suggestions, but have not been able to overcome this obstacle yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can find a workaround, please do share your findings.  Thanks again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, but VS 2008 automatically breaks on unhandled exceptions.  Also, I don't have a Debug-&gt;Exceptions dialog.  The NoViableAltException that is thrown is fully intended, and designed to be caught by user code.  Since it is not caught as expected, program execution halts unexpectedly as an unhandled exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exception thrown is derived from Exception and there is no multi-threading going on with ANTLR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fixture is a collection of files that contain the serialized contents of the database.  So it's like having a backup of the database but as it's something Django is aware of it's easier to use and will have additional benefits when you come to do things like unit testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can create a fixture from the data currently in your DB using &lt;code&gt;django-admin.py dumpdata&lt;/code&gt;.  By default the data is in JSON format, but other options such as XML are available.  A good place to store fixtures is a &lt;code&gt;fixtures&lt;/code&gt; sub-directory of your application directories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can load a fixure using &lt;code&gt;django-admin.py loaddata&lt;/code&gt; but more significantly, if your fixture has a name like &lt;code&gt;initial_data.json&lt;/code&gt; it will be automatically loaded when you do a &lt;code&gt;syncdb&lt;/code&gt;, saving the trouble of importing it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another benefit is that when you run &lt;code&gt;manage.py test&lt;/code&gt; to run your Unit Tests the temporary test database will also have the Initial Data Fixture loaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this will work when when you're adding attributes to models and columns to the DB.  If you drop a column from the Database you'll need to update your fixture to remove the data for that column which might not be straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works best when doing lots of little database changes during development.  For updating production DBs a manually generated SQL script can often work best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Create a routing rule for your module/action in the application's routing.yml file.  The following example is a routing rule for an action that shows the most recent questions in an application, defaulting to page 1 (using a pager):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;recent_questions:
   url:    questions/recent/:page
   param:  { module: questions, action: recent, page: 1 }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Once the routing rule is set, use the &lt;code&gt;url_for()&lt;/code&gt; helper in your template to format outgoing URLs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a href="&amp;lt;?php echo url_for('questions/recent?page=1') ?&amp;gt;"&amp;gt;Recent Questions&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, the following URL will be constructed: &lt;code&gt;http://myapp/questions/recent/1.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Incoming URLs (requests) will be analyzed by the routing system, and if a pattern match is found in the routing rule configuration, the named wildcards (ie. the &lt;code&gt;:/page&lt;/code&gt; portion of the URL) will become request parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use the &lt;code&gt;link_to()&lt;/code&gt; helper to output a URL without using the HTML &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/p&gt;

Whenever I do /etc/init.d/yaws restart or a stop/start, it initializes according to an old version of the config file (/etc/yaws/yaws.conf).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this because I changed the docroot from the default to another directory (call it A), then a few weeks later changed it to directory B, and the config file has stayed with B for the last several months.  But then, after a restart, it switches back to A.  If it switched back to the package default, that would be understandable, but it switches to an old customized version instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is that if I leave it stopped for several minutes, when I start it again, everything switches back to normal (using directory B).  But while it's stopped, if I run ps, I don't see any yaws-related processes (yaws, heart, etc).  This problem has survived several reboots, so it's got to be an old cached copy of the config somewhere, but I have yet to find anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can access the fields of a class using a dictionary because the fields of a class, its methods and all its properties are stored internally using dicts (at least in Cython).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...Which leads us to your second comment. Believing that Python dicts are "heavy" is an extremely non-pythonistic concept. And reading such comments kills my Python Zen. That's not good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, when you declare a class you are actually creating a pretty complex wrapper around a dictionary - so, if anything, you are adding more overhead than by using a simple dictionary. An overhead which, by the way, is meaningless in any case. If you are working on performance critical applications, use C or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just something simple like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CREATE TRIGGER KeepUpdated on Profiles
FOR UPDATE, INSERT AS 
UPDATE dbo.Profiles 
SET LastUpdate = GetDate()
WHERE Username IN (SELECT Username FROM inserted)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to get really fancy, have it evaluate what's being changed versus what's in the database and only modify LastUpdate if there was a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider this...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7am&lt;/strong&gt; - User 'jsmith' is created with a last name of 'Smithe' (oops), LastUpdate defaults to 7am&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8am&lt;/strong&gt; - 'jsmith' emails IT to say his name is incorrect. You immediately perform the update, so the last name is now 'Smith' and (thanks to the trigger) LastUpdate shows 8am&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2pm&lt;/strong&gt; - Your slacker coworker finally gets bored with StumbleUpon and checks his email. He sees the earlier message from 'jsmith' regarding the name change.  He runs: &lt;em&gt;UPDATE Profiles SET LastName='Smith' WHERE Username='jsmith'&lt;/em&gt; and then goes
back to surfing MySpace. The trigger doesn't care that the last name was already 'Smith', however, so LastUpdate now shows 2pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you just blindly change LastUpdate whenever an update statement runs, it's TECHNICALLY correct because an update did happen, but it probably makes more sense to actually compare the changes and act accordingly.  That way, the 2pm Update statement by the coworker would still run, but LastUpdate would still show 8am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is false. This used to catch all unhandled exceptions in .NET 1.0/1.1 but it was a bug and it wasn't supposed to and it was fixed in .NET 2.0. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException

&lt;p&gt;Is only intended to be used as a last chance logging saloon so you can log the exception before the program exits. It wont catch the exception as of 2.0 onwards (although in .NET 2.0 at least there is a config value you can modify to make it act like 1.1 but it isn't recommended practice to use this.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its worth noting that there are few exceptions that you &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; catch, such as StackOverflowException and OutOfMemoryException. Otherwise as other people have suggested it might be an exception in a background thread somewhere. Also I'm pretty sure you can't catch some/all unmanaged/native exceptions either.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;lt;/EnumsDefinition&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When debugging a large C++ application, which unfortunately has a very extensive usage of C++ exceptions.  Sometimes I catch an exception a little later than I actually want. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example in pseudo code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;FunctionB()
{
    ...
    throw e;
    ...
}

FunctionA()
{
    ...
    FunctionB()

}

try
{
    Function A()
}
catch(e)
{
    (&amp;lt;--- breakpoint)
    ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I catch the exception with a breakpoint when debugging.  But I can't trace back if the exception occurred in FunctionA() or FunctionB(), or some other function.  (Assuming extensive exception use and a huge version of the above example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One solution to my problem is to determine and save the call stack &lt;strong&gt;in the exception constructor&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. before it is caught).  But this would require me to derive all exceptions from this base exception class.  It would also require a lot of code, and perhaps slow down my program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there an easier way that requires less work?  Without having to change my large code base?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there better solutions to this problem in other languages?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Are there any general advice or workarounds for organizing or redistributing templated member definitions across multiple files?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes; don't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The C++ spec permits a compiler to be able to "see" the entire template (declaration &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; definition) at the point of instantiation, and (due to the complexities of any implementation) most compilers retain this requirement.  The upshot is that #inclusion of any template header must also #include any and all source required to instantiate the template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to deal with this is to dump everything into the header, inline where posible, out-of-line where necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you really regard this as an unacceptable affront, a common option is to split the template into the usual header/implementation pair, and then #include the implementation file at the end of the header.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C++'s "export" feature may or may not provide another workaround. The feature is poorly supported and poorly defined; although it in principle should permit some kind of separate compilation of templates, it doesn't necessarily obviate the demand that the compiler be able to see the entire template body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For protecting against SQL injection, don't do anything to the data itself.  Just use prepared statements, and that way, you don't have to worry about messing with the data that the user entered, and having it negatively affect your logic.  You have to sanitize a little bit, to ensure that numbers are numbers, and dates are dates, since everything is a string as it comes from the request, but don't try to do any checking to do things like block keywords or anything.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For protecting against XSS attacks, it would probably be easier to fix the data before it's stored.  However, as others mentioned, sometimes it's nice to have a pristine copy of exactly what the user entered, because once you change it, it's lost forever. It's almost too bad there's not a fool proof way to ensure you application only puts out sanitized HTML the way you can ensure you don't get caught by SQL injection by using prepared queries.&lt;/p&gt;

finally

If &lt;code&gt;MyThing&lt;/code&gt; implements &lt;code&gt;IDisposable&lt;/code&gt;, then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;using ( MyThing thing = new MyThing() )
{
    ...
    throw new ApplicationException("oops");
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And &lt;code&gt;thing.Dispose&lt;/code&gt; will be called as you leave the block, as the exception's thrown. If you want to combine a try/catch/finally and a using, you can either nest them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;try
{
    ...
    using ( MyThing thing = new MyThing() )
    {
        ...
    }
    ...
}
catch ( Exception e )
{
    ....
}
finally
{
    ....
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Or put the try/catch/finally in the using):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;using ( MyThing thing = new MyThing() )
{
    ...
    try
    {
        ...
    }
    catch ( Exception e )
    {
        ....
    }
    finally
    {
        ....
    }    
    ...
} // thing.Dispose is called now
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you can unroll the &lt;code&gt;using&lt;/code&gt; and explicitly call &lt;code&gt;Dispose&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; block as @&lt;a href="#36094"&gt;Quarrelsome&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated, adding any extra exception-handling or -recovery code that you need in the &lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; (or in the &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: In response to @&lt;a href="#36100"&gt;Toran Billups&lt;/a&gt;, if you need to process exceptions aside from ensuring that your &lt;code&gt;Dispose&lt;/code&gt; method is called, you'll either have to use a &lt;code&gt;using&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;try/catch/finally&lt;/code&gt; or unroll the &lt;code&gt;using&lt;/code&gt; - I don't thinks there's any other way to accomplish what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan is to look at the cardinality of the first &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; bits, then make a decision about what data structure to use for the remainder. Clearly some data structures are better for very sparse bit arrays, and others when roughly half the bits are set (when most bits are set, I can use negation to treat it as a sparse set of zeroes). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there's something wrong with the quotation of command-line arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ winewrap '/home/chris/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Microsoft Research/Z3-1.3.6/bin/z3.exe' -smt /tmp/smtlib3cee8b.smt
Executing: wine '/home/chris/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Microsoft Research/Z3-1.3.6/bin/z3.exe' '-smt' 'Z: mp\smtlib3cee8b.smt'
wine: cannot find ''/home/chris/.wine/drive_c/Program'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The path to the executable is being chopped off at the first space, even though it is single-quoted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The literal "\t" in the last path is being transformed into a tab character.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the quotations aren't being parsed the way I intended by the shell. How can I avoid these errors?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: The "\t" is being expanded through two levels of indirection: first, &lt;code&gt;"$p"&lt;/code&gt; (and/or &lt;code&gt;"$ARGS"&lt;/code&gt;) is being expanded into &lt;code&gt;Z:\tmp\smtlib3cee8b.smt&lt;/code&gt;; then, &lt;code&gt;\t&lt;/code&gt; is being expanded into the tab character. This is (seemingly) equivalent to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Y='y\ty'
Z="z${Y}z"
echo $Z
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which yields &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;zy\tyz
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;zy  yz
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: &lt;code&gt;eval "$CMD"&lt;/code&gt; does the trick. The "&lt;code&gt;\t&lt;/code&gt;" problem seems to be echo's fault: "If the first operand is -n, or if any of the operands contain a backslash ( '\' ) character, the results are implementation-defined."

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes, this size of the form is limited
  to the size of the desktop (more
  specifcally
  SystemInformation.MaxWindowTrackSize).
  This is done in the Form.SetBoundsCore
  protected virtual method. This
  behaviour cannot be changes or at
  least without a great deal of work and
  using PInvoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also supported &lt;a href="http://www.themssforum.com/VB/Maximum-Form/" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The size of the form in the designer
  is limited by your screen size.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;It sounds like you have your display
  at 1600x1200, hence the designer won't
  let you go larger then 1212.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;If you had your display at 1280x1024,
  then the designer wouldn't let you go
  larger then 1036.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I'm not really sure why the size of
  the form in the designer is limited to
  the screen size, as I may deploy on a
  machine that has a larger screen size
  them my development machine...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So looks like it cannot be done.. Thats some strange behaviour since it looks like you are limited to whatever your dev machine is..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the only way to do it is to size to the maximum resolution possible, set the form size, then revert back, but never touch the size again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some techniques only apply to compiled languages (I'm working on "old" PHP apps), but I would say most of the book is applicable to any language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refactoring books sometimes assume the code is in semi-ideal or "maintenance aware" state before refactoring, but the systems I work on are less than ideal and were developed as "learn as you go" apps, or as first apps for some technologies used (and I don't blame the initial developers for that, since I'm one of them), so there are no tests at all, and code is sometimes messy. This book addresses this kind of situation, whereas other refactoring books usually don't (well, not to this extent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should mention that I haven't received any money from the editor nor author of this book ;), but I found it very interesting, since resources are lacking in the field of legacy code (and particularly in my language, French, but that's another story).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The very quick dark brown fox"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the q is at index 9 and the f is at index 26.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language doesn't matter to me, this is more of a theory question than anything so use whatever language you want just try to keep it to generally popular and current languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sample string I gave is short but I'm hoping for a way that can efficiently handle any size string. So updating an array with the offset would work with a short string but will bog down with to many characters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though in the example I was looking for the index of unique characters in the string I also want to be able to track the index of the same character in different locations such as the o in brown and the o in fox. So searching is out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was hoping for the answer to be both time and memory efficient but if I had to choose just one I care more about performance speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantage of using the clickTAG technique is that you can set the URL to jump to in the HTML page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that you can set the flash movie to link to different places without modifying  the flash file (beyond adding the initial clickTAG code). You can use link tracking on the URL as well.&lt;/p&gt;

while(a &amp;lt; 10)

 cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; "a: " &amp;lt;&amp;lt; a &amp;lt;&amp;lt; " b: " &amp;lt;&amp;lt; b &amp;lt;&amp;lt; "\n";

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mylist = ["b", "C", "A"]
mylist.sort()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This modifies your original list (i.e. sorts in-place). To get a sorted copy of the list, without changing the original, use the &lt;a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#sorted"&gt;&lt;code&gt;sorted()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for x in sorted(mylist):
    print x
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the examples above are a bit naive, because they don't take locale into account, and perform a case-sensitive sorting. You can take advantage of the optional parameter &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; to specify custom sorting order (the alternative, using &lt;code&gt;cmp&lt;/code&gt;, is a deprecated solution, as it has to be evaluated multiple times - &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; is only computed once per element).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to sort according to the current locale, taking language-specific rules into account (&lt;a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functools.html#functools.cmp_to_key"&gt;&lt;code&gt;cmp_to_key&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a helper function from functools):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sorted(mylist, key=cmp_to_key(locale.strcoll))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, if you need, you can specify a &lt;a href="http://docs.python.org/library/locale.html"&gt;custom locale&lt;/a&gt; for sorting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import locale
locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, 'en_US.UTF-8') # vary depending on your lang/locale
assert sorted((u'Ab', u'ad', u'aa'),
  key=cmp_to_key(locale.strcoll)) == [u'aa', u'Ab', u'ad']
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last note: you will see examples of case-insensitive sorting which use the &lt;code&gt;lower()&lt;/code&gt; method - those are incorrect, because they work only for the ASCII subset of characters. Those two are wrong for any non-English data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# this is incorrect!
mylist.sort(key=lambda x: x.lower())
# alternative notation, a bit faster, but still wrong
mylist.sort(key=str.lower)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

The other problem I had using Subversion related to disk space. Subversion stores an alternate "shadow copy" of your files in your working directory. For Photoshop and Illustrator this is normally not that big of a deal, but I was using Premiere and After Effects as well, and the disk space required for the shadow copies doubled my disk usage.

&lt;p&gt;Assuming you are building a PDB then I don't think there are any options that control the amount of information in the PDB directly.  You can change the type of optimizations performed by the compiler to improve debuggabilty, but this will cost performance -- as your co-worker points out, disabling inline will help make things more obvious in the crash file, but will cost at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

I've looked around online (CodeCampServer, etc...) and they all seem to suffer the same issue wherein controller methods violate SRP (single responsibility principle) pretty consistently - such as a controller method that simply renders the view if the request is a GET but updates the model if it's a POST. Now I've got controller methods responsible for multiple logical routes throughout the application - say it checks for which button was clicked on the form and acts accordingly. I could redirect each button click to a different form action using JavaScript, but something doesn't feel right there either... The other big issue is the proliferation of magic strings - ViewData["foo"] = blah; Long story short, how do you guys structure your controller logic? One giant model object per view? Lots of little controller methods and JavaScript is the router? My goal is maintainable code - as features get piled on I'm starting to slide down that slippery slope...&lt;/p&gt;

A transport is a server that connects to both a XMPP server and a non-XMPP server.  By running a transport, I can use my Jabber client to talk to someone using, say, MSN Messenger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A transport typically connects once to the remote network for each JID that it sees as online.  That is, it's your option 2 in reverse.  This is because there is no special relationship between the transport and the non-XMPP network; the transport is simply acting as a bunch of regular clients.  For this to work, XMPP clients must first register with the transport, giving login credentials for the remote network, and allowing the transport to view their presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only reason this has a chance of scaling better is that there can be many transports for the same remote network.  For example, my Jabber server could run a transport to MSN, another Jabber server could run another one, and so on, each one providing connections for a different subset of XMPP users.  While this spreads out the load on the Jabber side, and load balancing on your system may spread out the load as well, it still requires many connections between the two systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your case, because (I assume) the non-XMPP side of things is cooperating, putting a XMPP server interface on the non-XMPP server is likely your best bet.  That server interface is best suited for managing the mapping between XMPP JIDs and how that JID will appear on its own network, rather than forcing XMPP users to register and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you haven't seen these, you might find them useful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So - what to do? Just call TextBox.DataBind() at some point. Or, if you have more than 1 control, just call Page.DataBind() in your Page_Load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Private Function Page_Load(sender as Object, e as EventArgs)

&lt;p&gt;As it says &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#Usage" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; - "Some of the largest projects that use Python are the Zope application server, YouTube, and the original BitTorrent client.

    &lt;p&gt;The functions ctime(), gmtime(), and localtime() all take as an argument a time value representing the time in seconds since the Epoch (00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970; see time(3) ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt; It would seem that indeed 64-bit systems are safe from this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import java.util.*;

class TimeTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        print(0);
        print(System.currentTimeMillis());
        print(Long.MAX_VALUE);
        print(Long.MAX_VALUE + 1);
    }

    static void print(long l) {
        System.out.println(new Date(l));
    }
}

That's why the compiler won't let you do anything other than += (which represents the add) or -= (which represents the remove).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way to refer to an event for metaprogramming purposes is as a System.Reflection.EventInfo, and reflection is probably the best way (if not the only way) to get ahold of one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Emperor XLII has written some beautiful code which should work for your own events, provided you've declared them from C# simply as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public event DelegateType EventName;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's because C# creates two things for you from that declaration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A private delegate field to serve as the backing
storage for the event&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The actual event along with
implementation code that makes use
of the delegate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conveniently, both of these have the same name.  That's why the sample code will work for your own events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, you can't rely on this to be the case when using events implemented by other libraries.  In particular, the events in Windows Forms and in WPF don't have their own backing storage, so the sample code will not work for them.&lt;/p&gt;

Three of the main constructs of the language are definitions, statements, and expressions. Definitions can contain statements and expressions, statements can contain definitions and expressions, and one kind of expression can contain statements.

Ideally, I would like to put the code for these in different files, but OMake complains about circular dependency issues. As far as I know, circular type definitions across modules are not allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way I know of to solve this is to define all three types at once:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;type defn = ...

If you use strongly-typed datasets you benefit from the strong typing but you pay for it in terms of the time it takes to create one even if you're just using part of it and its extensibility in terms of the code base. If you want to modify an existing one and you modify a row definition then this will create "shotgun" breaks in the code base as each definition for adding a new row will have to be modified as it wont compile anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid the above scenario the most sensible approach is to generally give up on sensible re-use. Define a dataset per purpose and per use. However the main issue with this is API use, you end up with dataset that is simliar to another dataset but because it is a different dataset type you have to transform it to use the common API which is both painful and inelegant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, plus the fact that strongly typed datasets make your code look horrid (the length of the type declarations) are pretty much the reasons i've given up on datasets and switched to business objects instead. &lt;/p&gt;

The total number of items we have is the number that we own plus the sum of all of the items that we're borrowing from various sources.  These numbers are all stored in our database, and it would be pointless to calculate this until the total is actually requested (since often Items will be used without the total being requested).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the total property checks whether the _total field exists.  If it doesn't, then the property code queries the database and computes it, then stores the value in the _total field so that it need not be recomputed the next time it's requested.&lt;/p&gt;

The opposite is Eager Loading, where you load something right away, long before you need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are curious why people might use lazy loading, consider an application that takes a LOOOOONG time to start.  This application is probably doing a lot of eager loading... loading things from disk, and doing calculations and whatnot long before it is ever needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare this to lazy loading, the application would start much faster, but then the first time you need to do something that requires some long running load, there may be a slight pause while it is loaded for the first time.  Thus, with lazy loading, you are amortizing the load time throughout the course of running your application... and you may actually save from loading things that the user may never intend to use.&lt;/p&gt;

CCITT Group 3 uses a Huffman Coding scheme. In the case of FAX they are using a fixed set of Huffman codes, but for a given data set, you can generate a specific set of codes for each data set to improve the compression ratio achieved. As long as you only need to access the bits sequentially, as you implied, this will be a pretty efficient approach. Random access would create some additional challenges, but you could probably generate a binary search tree index to various offset points in the array that would allow you to get close to the desired location and then walk in from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: The Huffman scheme still works well even if the data is random, as long as the 1/0 distribution is not perfectly even. That is, the less even the distribution, the better the compression ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if the bits are truly random with an even distribution, then, well, according to &lt;em&gt;Mr. Claude Shannon&lt;/em&gt;, you are not going to be able to compress it any significant amount using any scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in F# you can define a function thus:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let f x y z = x + y + z
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here function f takes parameters x, y and z and sums them together so:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;f 1 2 3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returns 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From our definition we can can therefore define the curry function for f:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let curry f = fun x -&amp;gt; f x
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where 'fun x -&gt; f x' is a lambda function equivilent to x =&gt; f(x) in C#. This function inputs the function you wish to curry and returns a function which &lt;em&gt;takes a single argument&lt;/em&gt; and returns the specified function with the first argument set to the input argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using our previous example we can obtain a curry of f thus:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let curryf = curry f
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can then do the following:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let f1 = curryf 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which provides us with a function f1 which is equivilent to f1 y z = 1 + y + z. This means we can do the following:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;f1 2 3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which returns 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process is often confused with 'partial function application' which can be defined thus:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let papply f x = f x
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though we can extend it to more than one parameter, i.e.:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let papply2 f x y = f x y
let papply3 f x y z = f x y z
etc.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A partial application will take the function and parameter(s) and return a function that requires one or more less parameters, and as the previous two examples show is implemented directly in the standard F# function definition so we could achieve the previous result thus:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let f1 = f 1
f1 2 3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which will return a result of 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between currying and partial function application is that:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currying takes a function and provides a new function accepting a single argument, and returning the specified function with its first argument set to that argument. &lt;em&gt;This allows us to represent functions with multiple parameters  as a series of single argument functions&lt;/em&gt;. Example:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let f x y z = x + y + z
let curryf = curry f
let f1 = curryf 1
let f2 = curryf 2
f1 2 3
6
f2 1 3
6
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partial function application is more direct - it takes a function and one or more arguments and returns a function with the first n arguments set to the n arguments specified. Example:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let f x y z = x + y + z
let f1 = f 1
let f2 = f 2
f1 2 3
6
f2 1 3
6
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

I never have to manually intervene, and I'll never lose another harddrive worth of data. If my computer dies, I'll always have a full bootable back-up that is no more than 24 hours old, and incremental back-ups no more than an hour old. Here are the details of how I do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only computer is a 160 gig MacBook running OSX Leopard.
On my desk at work I have 2 external 500 gig harddrives.
One of them is a single 500 gig partition called "External".
The other has a 160 gig partition called "Clone" and a 340 gig partition called TimeMachine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TimeMachine runs whenever I'm at work, constantly backing up my "in progress" files (which are also committed to Version Control throughout the day).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every weekday at 12:05, SuperDuper! automatically copies my entire laptop harddrive to the "Clone" drive. If my laptop's harddrive dies, I can actually boot directly from the Clone drive and pick up work without missing a beat -- giving me some time to replace the drive (This HAS happened to me TWICE since setting this up!). (Technical Note: It actually only copies over whatever has changed since the previous weekday at 12:05... not the entire drive every time. Works like a charm.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At home I have a D-Link DNS-323, which is a 1TB (2x500 gig) Network Attached Storage device running a Mirrored RAID, so that everything on the first 500 gig drive is automatically copied to the second 500 gig drive. This way, you always have a backup, and it's fully automated. This little puppy has a built-in Dynamic DNS client, and FTP server. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, on my WRT54G router, I forward the FTP port (21) to my DNS-323, and leave its FTP server up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the SuperDuper clone has been made, rSync runs and synchronizes my "External" drive with the DNS-323 at home, via FTP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it.
Using 4 drives (2 external, 2 in the NAS) I have:
1) An always-bootable complete backup less than 24 hours old, Monday-Friday
2) A working-backup of all my in-progress files, which is never more than 30 minutes old, Monday-Friday (when I'm at work and connected to the external drives)
3) Access to all my MP3s (170GB) at documents at work on the "External" and at home on the NAS
4) Two complete backups of all my MP3s and documents on the NAS (External is original copy, both drives on NAS are mirrors via ChronoSync)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do I do all of this?
Because:
1) In 2000, I dropped a 40 gig harddrive 1 inch, and it cost me $2500 to get that data back.
2) In the past year, I've had to take my MacBook in for repair 4 times. One dead harddrive, two dead motherboards, and a dead webcam. On the 4th time, they replaced my MacBook with a newer better one at no charge, and I haven't had a problem since. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my daily backups, I didn't lose any work, or productivity. If I hadn't had them, though, all my work would have been gone, along with my MP3s, and my writing, and all the photos of my trips to Peru, Croatia, England, France, Greece, Netherlands, Italy, and all my family photos. Can you imagine? I'm sure you can, because I bet you have a pile of digital photos sitting on your computer right now... not backed-up in any way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To implement this kind of technique, make sure that you separate concerns strictly. On the server, your service contract implementation classes should be the only bits of the code that work with data contracts. On the client, the service access layer should be the only code that works with the proxies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Layering like this lets you adjust the way that the service is implemented relatively independently of the UI layers calling the service and the business tier that's being called. It also gives you half a chance of unit testing!&lt;/p&gt;

In C++ you don't have to specify a class or an interface for the generic type. That's why you can create truly generic functions and classes, with the caveat of a looser typing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;typename T&amp;gt; T sum(T a, T b) { return a + b; }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method above adds two objects of the same type, and can be used for any type T that has the "+" operator available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Java you have to specify a type if you want to call methods on the objects passed, something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;T extends Something&amp;gt; T sum(T a, T b) { return a.add ( b ); }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In C++ generic functions/classes can only be defined in headers, since the compiler generates different functions for different types (that it's invoked with). So the compilation is slower. In Java the compilation doesn't have a major penalty, but Java uses a technique called "erasure" where the generic type is erased at runtime, so at runtime Java is actually calling ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Something sum(Something a, Something b) { return a.add ( b ); }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This problem can be prevented by carefull design of your object model too. (using aggregates and only loading aggregate roots like in domain driven design is a way to get around this without using lazy loading).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lazy loading can result in the or mapper doing lots of small database accesses instead of retrieving all the data you need once. This can result in performance problems too.&lt;/p&gt;

This assumes, of course, that the code is based on concatenated chunks, which may not be the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it's base64 encoded then we might have something ;) but my gut tells me that there are too many distinct chunks of length 3 for plain English text.  There is indeed that odd blip for the symbol "323" though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhat more interesting is a chunk size of 2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this isn't appropriate, token services work just fine, but for some situations they may be just too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application I'm working on needed bare-bones authentication. Our server and client run inside a (very secure) intranet, so we didn't care too much for the requirement to use an X.509 certificate to encrypt the communication, which is required if you're using username authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we added a &lt;a href="http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/2006/10/02/CustomWCFBehaviorsThroughAppConfig.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;custom behavior&lt;/a&gt; to the client that adds the username and (encrypted) password to the message headers, and another custom behavior on the server that verifies them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All very simple, required no changes to the client side service access layer or the service contract implementation. And as it's all done by configuration, if and when we need to move to something a little stronger it'll be easy to migrate.&lt;/p&gt;

Chris Smith (guy on the F# team at MS) has an article called 'F# in 20 minutes' - &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/chrsmith/archive/2008/05/02/f-in-20-minutes-part-i.aspx"&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/chrsmith/archive/2008/05/09/f-in-20-minutes-part-ii.aspx"&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note you have to be careful as the latest CTP of F# (version 1.9.6.0) has some seriously breaking changes compared to previous versions, so some examples/tutorials out there might not work without modification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a quick run-down of some cool stuff, maybe I can give you a few hints here myself which are clearly &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; brief and probably not great but hopefully gives you something to play with!:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First note - most examples on the internet will assume 'lightweight syntax' is turned on. To achieve this use the following line of code:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#light
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This prevents you from having to insert certain keywords that are present for OCaml compatibility and also having to terminate each line with semicolons. Note that using this syntax means indentation defines scope. This will become clear in later examples, all of which rely on lightweight syntax being switched on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're using the interactive mode you have to terminate all statements with double semi-colons, for example:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &amp;gt; #light;;
  &amp;gt; let f x y = x + y;;

  val f : int -&amp;gt; int -&amp;gt; int

  &amp;gt; f 1 2;;
  val it : int = 3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that interactive mode returns a 'val' result after each line. This gives important information about the definitions we are making, for example 'val f : int -&gt; int -&gt; int' indicates that a function which takes two ints returns an int.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that only in interactive do we need to terminate lines with semi-colons, when actually defining F# code we are free of that :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You define functions using the 'let' keyword. This is probably the most important keyword in all of F# and you'll be using it a lot. For example:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let sumStuff x y = x + y
let sumStuffTuple (x, y) = x + y
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can call these functions thus:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sumStuff 1 2
3
sumStuffTuple (1, 2)
3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note there are two different ways of defining functions here - you can either separate parameters by whitespace or specify parameters in 'tuples' (i.e. values in parentheses separated by commas). The difference is that we can use 'partial function application' to obtain functions which take less than the required parameters using the first approach, and not with the second. E.g.:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let sumStuff1 = sumStuff 1
sumStuff 2
3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note we are obtaining a function from the expression 'sumStuff 1'. When we can pass around functions just as easily as data that is referred to as the language having 'first class functions', this is a fundamental part of any functional language such as F#.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pattern matching is pretty darn cool, it's basically like a switch statement on steroids (yeah I nicked that phrase from another F#-ist :-). You can do stuff like:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let someThing x =
  match x with
    | 0 -&amp;gt; "zero"
    | 1 -&amp;gt; "one"
    | 2 -&amp;gt; "two"
    | x when x &amp;lt; 0 -&amp;gt; "negative = " + x.ToString()
    | _ when x%2 = 0 -&amp;gt; "greater than two but even"
    | _ -&amp;gt; "greater than two but odd"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note we use the '_' symbol when we want to match on something but the expression we are returning does not depend on the input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can abbreviate pattern matching using if, elif, and else statements as required:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let negEvenOdd x = if x &amp;lt; 0 then "neg" elif x % 2 = 0 then "even" else "odd"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F# lists (which are implemented as linked lists underneath) can be manipulated thus:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let l1 = [1;2;3]
l1.[0]
1

let l2 = [1 .. 10]
List.length l2
10

let squares = [for i in 1..10 -&amp;gt; i * i]
squares
[1; 4; 9; 16; 25; 36; 49; 64; 81; 100]

let square x = x * x;;
let squares2 = List.map square [1..10]
squares2
[1; 4; 9; 16; 25; 36; 49; 64; 81; 100]

let evenSquares = List.filter (fun x -&amp;gt; x % 2 = 0) squares
evenSqares
[4; 16; 36; 64; 100]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the List.map function 'maps' the square function on to the list from 1 to 10, i.e. applies the function to each element. List.filter 'filters' a list by only returning values in the list that pass the predicate function provided. Also note the 'fun x -&gt; f' syntax - this is the F# lambda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that throughout we have not defined any types - the F# compiler/interpreter 'infers' types, i.e. works out what you want from usage. For example:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let f x = "hi " + x
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the compiler/interpreter will determine x is a string since you're performing an operation which requires x to be a string. It also determines the return type will be string as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When there is ambiguity the compiler makes assumptions, for example:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let f x y = x + y
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here x and y could be a number of types, but the compiler defaults to int. If you want to define types you can using type annotation:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let f (x:string) y = x + y
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also note that we have had to enclose x:string in parentheses, we often have to do this to separate parts of a function definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two really useful and heavily used operators in F# are the pipe forward and function composition operators |&gt; and &gt;&gt; respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We define |&gt; thus:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let (|&amp;gt;) x f = f x
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that you can define operators in F#, this is pretty cool :-).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows you to write things in a clearer way, e.g.:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[1..10] |&amp;gt; List.map (fun x -&amp;gt; x * x) |&amp;gt; List.filter (fun x -&amp;gt; x % 2 = 0)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will allow you to obtain the first 10 even squares. That is clearer than:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;List.filter (fun x -&amp;gt; x % 2 = 0) (List.map (fun x -&amp;gt; x * x) [1..10])
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, at least I think so :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Function composition defined by the &gt;&gt; operator is defined as follows:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let (&amp;gt;&amp;gt;) f g x = g(f(x))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I.e. you forward-pipe an operation only the parameter of the first function remains unspecified. This is useful as you can do the following:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let mapFilter = List.map (fun x -&amp;gt; x * x) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; List.filter (fun x -&amp;gt; x % 2 = 0)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here mapFilter will accept a list an input and return the list filtered as before. It's an abbreviated version of:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let mapFilter = l |&amp;gt; List.map (fun x -&amp;gt; x * x) |&amp;gt; List.filter (fun x -&amp;gt; x % 2 = 0)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we want to write recursive functions we have to define the function as recursive by placing 'rec' after the let. Examples below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some cool stuff:-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factorial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let rec fact x = if x &amp;lt;= 1 then 1 else x * fact (x-1)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nth Fibonacci Number&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let rec fib n = if n &amp;lt;= 1 then n else fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FizzBuzz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let (/%) x y = x % y = 0
let fb = function
  | x when x /% 15 -&amp;gt; "FizzBuzz"
  | x when x /% 3  -&amp;gt; "Fizz"
  | x when x /% 5  -&amp;gt; "Buzz"
  | x              -&amp;gt; x.ToString()

[1..100] |&amp;gt; List.map (fb &amp;gt;&amp;gt; printfn "%s")
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm guessing most of the execution time will be in the calls to ST_DWithin() and ST_Distance(), although if the id and category columns aren't indexed then it might be doing some interesting table scanning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hive is based on Hadoop which is a batch processing system. Accordingly, this system does not and &lt;strong&gt;cannot promise low latencies on queries&lt;/strong&gt;. The paradigm here is strictly of submitting jobs and being notified when the jobs are completed as opposed to real time queries. As a result it should not be compared with systems like Oracle where analysis is done on a significantly smaller amount of data but the analysis proceeds much more iteratively with the response times between iterations being less than a few minutes. &lt;strong&gt;For Hive queries response times for even the smallest jobs can be of the order of 5-10 minutes and for larger jobs this may even run into hours.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since HBase and HyperTable are all about performance (being modeled on Google's BigTable), they sound like they would certainly be much faster than Hive, at the cost of functionality and a higher learning curve (e.g., they don't have joins or the SQL-like syntax).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have more sophisticated commands, then maybe creating a formal grammar would be a better idea.

If you see someone complaining about lisp syntax (or lack thereof), there's a good chance that they're one of those people who has failed to grasp lisp's greatness.

&lt;p&gt;I often have four or more consoles and other apps on a virtual desktop and with wmii I don't have to fiddle with resizing windows to line everything up just so. I can trivially rearrange them into vertical columns, stack them up vertically, have them share equal amounts of vertical or horizontal space, and move them between screens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you open two consoles on your desktop. You'd get this (with apologies for the cronkey artwork):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; ----------------
|                |
|       1        |
|                |
 ----------------
 ----------------
|                |
|       2        |
|                |
 ----------------
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I want them side-by-side. I enter SHIFT-ALT-L in window 2 to move it rightwards and create two columns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; -------  -------
|       ||       |
|       ||       |
|   1   ||   2   |
|       ||       |
|       ||       |
 -------  -------
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I could open another console and get&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; -------  -------
|       ||   2   |
|       ||       |
|       | -------
|   1   | -------
|       ||   3   |
|       ||       |
 -------  -------
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I want to temporarily view console 3 full-height, so I hit ALT-s in it and get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; -------  -------
|       | -------
|       ||       |
|   1   ||   3   |
|       ||       |
|       ||       |
 -------  -------
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consoles 2 and 3 are stacked up now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could also give windows tags. For example, in console 2 I could say ALT-SHIFT-twww+dev and that console would be visible in the 'www' and 'dev' virtual desktops. (The desktops are created if they don't already exist.) Even better, the console can be in a different visual configuration (e.g., stacked and full-screen) on each of those desktops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I can't do tabbed window managers justice here. I don't know if it's relevant to your environment but if you get the chance to try this way of working you probably won't look back.&lt;/p&gt;

An alternative would be &lt;a href="http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/"&gt;haml&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

However, those that do will point you to &lt;code&gt;cmd --help&lt;/code&gt; and you will find some decent documentation there.

Or better yet, it doesn't have to be a command, it can be an entire &lt;em&gt;topic&lt;/em&gt;.  Coincidentally to install cheat you would do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo gem install cheat
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cheat gem
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That will &lt;a href="http://cheat.errtheblog.com/s/gem/" rel="nofollow"&gt;list out a "man page"&lt;/a&gt; written by users like you about the gem command.

In these cases the compiler will do the right thing for you, but the overall size of the struct/class may be more wastefull than necessary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

    char A;
    int B;

&lt;p&gt;I should mention though that compiling from source is very easy and offers developers quite a bit of neat flexibility.  You can &lt;a href="http://www.nabble.com/Re:--SVN--Re:-Changes-for-Ruby-1.9-td19223651.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;add a suffix&lt;/a&gt; to the generated commands so that you can have standalone Ruby 1.8 and Ruby 1.9 builds both at the same time.  That can be very helpful for testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, its always a danger to update an operating systems built in commands unless it occurs through an official update.  Installed applications may be expecting to a Ruby 1.8 in the standard location and crash if they meet an updated version.  Any updates you make should just not overwrite one that came with an OS.  (If any app crashes then its the fault of the app's developers for not specifying the absolute path to the OS version).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using one of the .NET based languages, you should use XML comments for both public and private members as Visual Studio will use this information to display intellisense for your classes. You can also use these comments to automatically generate API documentation using tools like SandCastle. This does mean the information needs to be kept up to date, but that should be a &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; small percentage of time spent. If you aren't using one the .NET based languages, there are other tools (like Doxygen or Javadoc) that provide comments and functionality similar to XML comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are large files to be cached, I'd look at ensuring your content engine supports If-Modified-Since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For smaller files (page content, CSS, images, etc), where reducing the number of round-trips is the key, having a long expiry time (a year?) and changing the URL when the content changes is the best. This lets you control when user agents will fetch the new content.&lt;/p&gt;

I won't repeat it all here, but these are good reads which will guide you on what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My feeling is to pick a time period high enough to cover most users single sessions but low enough to not cause too much inconvenience should you wish to update the content. Be sure to support If-Modified-Since if you have a Last-Modified for all your content. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if your content is cacheable at all and you need to push new content out now, you can always use a new URL. This final cachable content URL can sit behind a fixed &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_302" rel="nofollow"&gt;HTTP 302 redirect&lt;/a&gt; URL should you wish to publish a permanent link to the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code reviews are about ensuring that other people have a chance to see the code and hear from the author the purpose of that code in order to help ensure that it was implemented in the best possible way and that it accurately (or as accurately as possible) meets the requirements. They are also a good way of enforcing and teaching any code standards you have in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are introducing the idea, definately lead by example. Use your own code for the first several code reviews so people get an idea of how they work. Also, don't be selective about who participates in the reviews. If you can, get the entire development team together as well as at least one QA person.

The idea is that you can pass functions as parameters to other functions and return them as values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functional programming involves writing code that does not change state. The primary reason for doing so is so that successive calls to a function will yield the same result. You can write functional code in any language that supports first-class functions, but there are some languages, like Haskell, which do not allow you to change state. In fact, you're not supposed to make any side effects (like printing out text) at all - which sounds like it could be completely useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haskell instead employs a different approach to IO: monads. These are objects that contain the desired IO operation to be executed by your interpreter's toplevel. At any other level they are simply objects in the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What advantages does functional programming provide? Functional programming allows coding with fewer potentials for bugs because each component is completely isolated. Also, using recursion and first-class functions allows for simple proofs of correctness which typically mirror the structure of the code.&lt;/p&gt;

Its idea is to enable you to scan through a file as quickly and easily as possible, either looking for something or to get an overview of its structure. I prefix every public or protected method or property with the following comment structure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/* ====== MethodName ====== */

/// &amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;
///  XML comments go here

void MethodName()

&lt;p&gt;Of all the conventions I've seen so far, this one, to my eyes at least, seems to be the clearest way of making each method stand out, and it makes it easiest to scan quickly through a file of source code. Having said that, I hate XML comments with a vengeance because of the visual clutter of the angle bracket tax, and I wish that Microsoft had settled for something more along the lines of Javadoc or PHPdoc:&lt;/p&gt;

/**

 * @returns A number
 */

int methodName(String param)

They use side effect free functions as a basic building block in the language. This enables lots of things and makes a lot of things more difficult (or in most cases different from what people are used to)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest advantages with functional programming is that the order of execution of side effect free functions is not important. For example in erlang this is used to enable concurrency in a very transparent way. 
And because functions in functional languages behave very similar to mathematical functions it's easy to translate those into functional languages. In some cases this can make code more readable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally one of the big disadvantages of functional programming was also the lack of side effects. It's very difficult to write useful software without IO, but IO is hard to implement without side-effects in functions. So most people never got more out of functional programming than calculating a single output from a single input. In modern mixed paradigm languages like F# or scala this is easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of modern languages have elements from functional programming languages. C# 3.0 has a lot functional programming features and you can do functional programming in python too. I think the reasons for the popularity of functional programming is mostly because of two reasons. Concurrency is getting a real problem in normal programming because we're getting more and more multiprocessor computers. And the languages are getting more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

From what Joel was saying, the first few steps are pretty standard:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One server running both the webserver and the database (the current Stackoverflow setup)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One webserver and one database server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two load-balanced webservers and one database server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They didn't talk much about what comes next though.  Do you add more webservers?  Another database server?  Replicate this three-machine cluster in a different datacenter for redundancy?  Where does a web startup go from here in the hardware department?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may see pragma directives (in C/C++) that change the alignment. This should only be used when very specific alignment is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single combined application/database server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Separate database on a different machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second application server with DNS round-robin (poor man's load balancing) or, e.g. &lt;a href="http://www.danga.com/perlbal/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Perlbal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, replicated database server (for read loads, requires some application logic changes so eligible database reads go to a slave)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, evaluating the current state of affairs would help to determine a better scaling path. For example, if read load is high and content doesn't change too often, it might be better to emphasise caching and introduce dedicated front-end caches, e.g. &lt;a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Squid&lt;/a&gt; to avoid un-needed database reads, although you will need to consider how to maintain &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_coherency" rel="nofollow"&gt;cache coherency&lt;/a&gt;, typically in the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if content changes reasonably often, then you will probably prefer a more spread-out solution; introduce a few more application servers and database slaves to help mitigate the effects, and use object caching, such as &lt;a href="http://www.danga.com/memcached/" rel="nofollow"&gt;memcached&lt;/a&gt; to avoid hitting the database for the less volatile content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most sites, this is probably enough, although if you do become a global phenomenon, then you'll probably want to start considering having hardware in regional data centres, and using tricks such as geographic load balancing to direct visitors to the closest "cluster". By that point, you'll probably be in a position to hire engineers who can really fine-tune things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the most valuable scaling advice I can think of would be to avoid worrying about it all far too soon; concentrate on developing a service people are going to want to use, and making the application reasonably robust. Some easy early optimisations are to make sure your database design is fairly solid, and that indexes are set up so you're not doing anything painfully crazy; also, make sure the application emits cache-control headers that direct browsers on how to cache the data. Doing this sort of work early on in the design can yield benefits later, especially when you don't have to rework the entire thing to deal with cache coherency issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second most valuable piece of advice I want to put across is that you shouldn't assume what works for some other web site will work for you; check your logs, run some analysis on your traffic and profile your application - see where your bottlenecks are and resolve them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The following example is obsolete - true at the time (2008), but long ago fixed in more recent CLR versions. Reflection in general is still a somewhat costly thing, though!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case in point: You should never use a member declared as "Object" in a lock (C#) / SyncLock (VB.NET) statement in high-performance code. Why? Because the CLR can't lock on a value type, which means that it has to do a run-time reflection type check to see whether or not your Object is actually a value type instead of a reference type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm testing it out on a practice page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function customError($level,$message,$file,$line,$context){
echo "Sorry, an error has occured on line $line.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;";
echo "The function that caused the error says $message.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;";
die();
}

set_error_handler("customError");

echo($imAFakeVariable);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works fine, returning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, an error has occured on line 17.
The function that caused the error says Undefined variable: imAFakeVariable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this setup doesn't work for undefined functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function customError($level,$message,$file,$line,$context){
echo "Sorry, an error has occured on line $line.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;";
echo "The function that caused the error says $message.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;";
die();
}

set_error_handler("customError");

imAFakeFunction();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This returns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fatal error: Call to undefined function: imafakefunction() in /Library/WebServer/Documents/experimental/errorhandle.php on line 17&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why isn't my custom error handler catching undefinedd functions?  Are there other problems that this will cause?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks,
Jason&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a guess, I'd say that undefined function errors travel through a different execution path than other error types. Perhaps the PHP designers could tell you more, except I doubt PHP is in any way designed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you'd like your scripts to fail gracefully while still writing them PHP-style, try putting the entire page in a function and then call it within a &lt;code&gt;try..catch&lt;/code&gt; block.&lt;/p&gt;

(x) returns 2

&lt;p&gt;What this function, make-counter, does is it returns a function, which we've called x, that will count up by one each time its called. Since we're not providing any parameters to x it must somehow remember the count. It knows where to find it based on what's called lexical scoping - it must look to the spot where it's defined to find the value. This "hidden" value is what is called a closure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my currying example again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(define (add a)
  (lambda (b)
    (+ a b)))

(define add3 (add 3))

(add3 4) returns 7
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you can see is that when you call add with the parameter a (which is 3), that value is contained in the closure of the returned function that we're defining to be add3. That way, when we call add3 it knows where to find the a value to perform the addition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the clean urls that mvc tends to have but use asp.net webforms for my primary development. I normally use a url rewriter in order to accomplish this type stuff. When I say clean urls I mean like /products to get a list of products and /products/Product_One to look at the info about product called Product_One. I've used this on sites where the listing is on one page and when you pick the item it goes to a different page that shows the info about the item selected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also like the way that the update panel works and changing stuff on screen with out flashing the screen. When I do this I tend to have a list on the left with the different items that are selectable and then have on the left the data about the selected item, then I use an update panel so that when the item on the left is selected it's data shows up on the left without flashing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need opinions on what you all think of the two different methods of displaying a list and seeing the item that is selected's data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Which is better in your opinion? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) What do you all do to display a list and show the data on one of the items? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Is there another way of doing this? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Is it possible to combine the update panel method and the nice urls? (i.e. change the url to match the url that would get you to the current displayed data even though the update panel was used, and add to the history the new clean url for the current page)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stack copying isn't that complex and there are a number of well-understood techniques available to improve performance.  Using heap-allocated frames is also fairly simple, but you make a tradeoff of creating overhead for "normal" situation where you aren't using explicit continuations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you convert input code to continuation passing style (CPS) then you can get away with eliminating the stack altogether.  However, while CPS is elegant it adds another processing step in the front end and requires additional optimization to overcome certain performance implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer has 5 different security zones be default: Local Machine Zone, Intranet, Internet, Trusted, and Restricted
These are determined in urlmon.dll (Url Moniker)
More information here: &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537183" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537183&lt;/a&gt;(VS.85).aspx&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537182" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537182&lt;/a&gt;(VS.85).aspx&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way that IE determines the security zones should not have changes between IE6 and IE7 (or IE8 for that matter)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intranet sites are determined:
1. By url host names do not have any dots (&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://stackoverflow&lt;/a&gt; vs &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://stackoverflow.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

  available as free downloads through

&lt;li&gt;MPI is a communication protocol while Spread and MQ are actual implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MPI comes from "parallel" programming while Spread comes from "distributed" programming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it really depends on whether you are trying to build a parallel system or distributed system. They are related to each other, but the implied connotations/goals are different. Parallel programming deals with increasing computational power by using multiple computers simultaneously. Distributed programming deals with reliable (consistent, fault-tolerant and highly available) group of computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of "reliability" is slightly different from that of TCP. TCP's reliability is "give this packet to the end program no matter what." The distributed programming's reliability is "even if some machines die, the system as a whole continues to work in consistent manner." To really guarantee that all participants got the message, one would need something like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_commit_protocol"&gt;2 phase commit&lt;/a&gt; or one of faster alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The following error types &lt;strong&gt;cannot&lt;/strong&gt; be handled with a user defined function: E_ERROR, E_PARSE, E_CORE_ERROR, E_CORE_WARNING, E_COMPILE_ERROR, E_COMPILE_WARNING, and most of E_STRICT raised in the file where set_error_handler() is called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling undefined functions triggers an E_ERROR, thus it can not be handled by the error callback (or by exception handlers for that matter). All that you can do is set error_reporting to 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS, if you are rolling your own error handler, you should take care to handle correctly the @ operator. From the documentation (emphasis added):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is important to remember that the standard PHP error handler is completely bypassed. error_reporting() settings will have no effect and your error handler will be called regardless - however you are still able to read the current value of error_reporting and act appropriately. &lt;strong&gt;Of particular note is that this value will be 0 if the statement that caused the error was prepended by the @ error-control operator.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This is because &lt;code&gt;set_error_handler&lt;/code&gt; is meant to be a method of reporting errors thrown by the &lt;em&gt;user&lt;/em&gt; error function &lt;code&gt;trigger_error&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I did find this comment in the manual that may help you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"The following error types cannot be handled with a user defined function: &lt;code&gt;E_ERROR&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;E_PARSE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;E_CORE_ERROR&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;E_CORE_WARNING&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;E_COMPILE_ERROR&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;E_COMPILE_WARNING&lt;/code&gt;, and most of &lt;code&gt;E_STRICT&lt;/code&gt; raised in the file where &lt;code&gt;set_error_handler()&lt;/code&gt; is called."&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;This is not exactly true.  &lt;code&gt;set_error_handler()&lt;/code&gt; can't handle them, but &lt;code&gt;ob_start()&lt;/code&gt; can handle at least &lt;code&gt;E_ERROR&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?php

function error_handler($output)
{
    $error = error_get_last();
    $output = "";
    foreach ($error as $info =&amp;gt; $string)
        $output .= "{$info}: {$string}\n";
    return $output;
}

ob_start('error_handler');

will_this_undefined_function_raise_an_error();

?&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really though these errors should be silently reported in a file, for example. Hopefully you won't have many &lt;code&gt;E_PARSE&lt;/code&gt; errors in your project! :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for general error reporting, stick with Exceptions (I find it helpful to make them tie in with my MVC system). You can build a pretty versatile Exception to provide options via buttons and add plenty of description to let the user know what's wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice most fields have simple getters and setters. That's why in Java 7 probably there will be added properties which would behave like normal fields unless you need more control over getting/setting a value to them. There's still discussion over it. One of possible solutions would look like this: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public property String foo;   
a-&amp;gt;Foo = b-&amp;gt;Foo;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read more on this on &lt;a href="http://tech.puredanger.com/java7/#property"&gt;Alex Miller's Java 7&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: It's highly unlikely that property support will be added in Java 7 or perhaps ever.  Other JVM languages like Groovy, Scala, etc do support this feature now. - Alex Miller&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I would avoid using a QueryString param or the like since they could try bouncing themselves back to a page they are not supposed to (possible security issue?). You could then create a static method to handle the redirection object, which could read the information and act accordingly. This encapsulates your redirection process within one page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using an object also means you can later extend it if required (such as adding return messages and other info).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title asks about disposal, but then says that they want memory back immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.Net is &lt;em&gt;managed&lt;/em&gt;, which means that when you write .Net apps you don't need to worry about memory directly, the cost is that you don't have direct control over memory either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.Net decides when it's best to clean up and free memory, not you as the .Net coder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Dispose&lt;/code&gt; is a way to tell .Net that you're done with something, but it won't actually free up the memory until it's the best time to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically .Net will actually collect the memory back when it's easiest for it to do so - it's very good at deciding when.  Unless you're writing something very memory intensive you normally don't need to overrule it (this is part of the reason games aren't often written in .Net yet - they need complete control)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In .Net you can use &lt;code&gt;GC.Collect()&lt;/code&gt; to force it to immediately, but that is almost always bad practise. If .Net hasn't cleaned it up yet that means it isn't a particularly good time for it to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;GC.Collect()&lt;/code&gt; picks up the objects that .Net identifies as done with. If you haven't disposed an object that needs it .Net may decide to keep that object. This means that &lt;code&gt;GC.Collect()&lt;/code&gt; is only effective if you correctly implement your disposable instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;GC.Collect()&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a replacement for correctly using IDisposable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Dispose and memory are not directly related, but they don't need to be.  Correctly disposing will make your .Net apps more efficient and therefore use less memory though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;99% of the time in .Net the following is best practice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 1:&lt;/strong&gt; If you don't deal with anything &lt;em&gt;unmanaged&lt;/em&gt; or that implements &lt;code&gt;IDisposable&lt;/code&gt;  then don't worry about Dispose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 2:&lt;/strong&gt; If you have a local variable that implements IDisposable make sure that you get rid of it in the current scope:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;//using is best practice
using( SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection("my con str" ) )
{
    //do stuff
} 

//this is what 'using' actually compiles to:
SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection("my con str" ) ;
try
{
    //do stuff
}
finally
{
    con.Dispose();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 3:&lt;/strong&gt; If a class has a property or member variable that implements IDisposable then that class should implement IDisposable too. In that class's Dispose method you can also dispose of your IDisposable properties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;//rather basic example
public sealed MyClass :
   IDisposable
{   
    //this connection is disposable
    public SqlConnection MyConnection { get; set; }

    //make sure this gets rid of it too
    public Dispose() 
    {
        //if we still have a connection dispose it
        if( MyConnection != null )
            MyConnection.Dispose();

        //note that the connection might have already been disposed
        //always write disposals so that they can be called again
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn't really complete, which is why the example is sealed. Inheriting classes may need to observe the next rule...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 4:&lt;/strong&gt; If a class uses an &lt;em&gt;unmanaged&lt;/em&gt; resource then implement IDispose &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; add a finaliser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.Net can't do anything with the &lt;em&gt;unmanaged&lt;/em&gt; resource, so now we are talking about memory. If you don't clean it up you can get a memory leak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dispose method needs to deal with both &lt;em&gt;managed&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;unmanaged&lt;/em&gt; resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finaliser is a safety catch - it ensures that if someone else creates and instance of your class and fails to dispose it the 'dangerous' &lt;em&gt;unmanaged&lt;/em&gt; resources can still be cleaned up by .Net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~MyClass()
{
    //calls a protected method 
    //the false tells this method
    //not to bother with managed
    //resources
    this.Dispose(false);
}

public void Dispose()
{
    //calls the same method
    //passed true to tell it to
    //clean up managed and unmanaged 
    this.Dispose(true);

    //as dispose has been correctly
    //called we don't need the 

    //'backup' finaliser
    GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally this overload of Dispose that takes a boolean flag:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
{
    //check this hasn't been called already
    //remember that Dispose can be called again
    if (!disposed)
    {
        //this is passed true in the regular Dispose
        if (disposing)
        {
            // Dispose managed resources here.
        }

        //both regular Dispose and the finaliser
        //will hit this code
        // Dispose unmanaged resources here.
    }

    disposed = true;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that once this is all in place other managed code creating an instance of your class can just treat it like any other IDisposable (Rules 2 and 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with all of your rules except #4. Adding a finalizer should only be done under very specific circumstances. If a class uses unmanaged resources, those should be cleaned up in your Dispose(bool) function. This same function should only cleanup managed resources when bool is true. Adding a finalizer adds a complexity cost to using your object as each time you create a new instance it must also be placed on the finalization queue, which is checked each time the GC runs a collection cycle. Effectively, this means that your object survives one cycle/generation longer than it should so the finalizer can be run. The finalizer should not be thought of as a "safety net".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GC will only run a collection cycle when it determines that there is not enough available memory in the Gen0 heap to perform the next allocation, unless you "help" it by calling GC.Collect() to force an out-of-band collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that, no matter what, the GC only knows how to release resources by calling the Dispose method (and possibly the finalizer if one is implemented). It is up to that method to "do the right thing" and clean up any unmanaged resources used and instruct any other managed resources to call their Dispose method. It is very efficient at what it does and can self-optimize to a large extent as long as it isn't helped by out-of-band collection cycles.

&lt;p&gt;But since this question has tag Git, the distributed alternative
springs to mind, in which customizations are kept on a private testing
branch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;A---B---C---D---           &amp;lt;- mainline (public)
     \       \
      B'------D'---        &amp;lt;- testing (private)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this scheme, the mainline contains a generic, "template" config
file requiring the minimal amount of adjustments to become functional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, developers/testers can tweak the config file to their heart's
content, and only commit these changes locally on one a private
testing branch (e.g. B' = B + customizations).  Each time mainline
advances, they effortlessly merge it into testing, which results in
merge commits such as D' (= D + merged version of B's customizations).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scheme really shines when the "template" config file is updated:
the changes from both sides get merged, and are extremely likely to
result into conflicts (or test failures) if they are incompatible!&lt;/p&gt;

The general feel of the system is that it is a bug-ridden undocumented piece of crap. The only positive thing I can say is that the OS code itself follows internal coding standards relatively well. The standard CodeWarrior IDE was garbage (although Carbide, which came out as a replacement recently, is pretty decent but the free version was very barebones and several versions behind, at least some time ago). The emulator was barely usable - it ran slow, differed from the actual device and crashed or hung often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to develop on Symbian, be prepared for a lot of trial and error because there is almost no documentation available, even on the core concepts of the environment. As a fictional example, the basic documentation for the method "JiggleThingy()" would be "Jiggles the thingy". Of course, there were many occasions where the implementation was quite different from the documentation, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An aquaintance ran a mobile software development company in Asia for a few years and developed for pretty much all of the platforms. He told me that Symbian was the worst of the lot - it caused far more headache than any other mobile platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all about C++ development. Developing for Symbian using Java offers so limited functionality that I have not heard of anyone that actually has done it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have an arbitrary subset of n/2 bits set to 1 out of n total bits.  You have (n choose n/2) possibilities.  Using &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s_formula" rel="nofollow"&gt;Stirling's formula&lt;/a&gt;, this is roughly 2^n / sqrt(n) * sqrt(2/pi).  If every possibility is equally likely, then there's no way to give more likely choices shorter representations.  So we need log_2 (n choose n/2) bits, which is about n - (1/2)log(n) bits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's not a very good savings of memory.  For example, if you're working with n=2^20 (1 meg), then you can only save about 10 bits.  It's just not worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said all that, it also seems very unlikely that any really useful data is truly random.  In case there's any more structure to your data, there's probably a more optimistic answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the two options in achieving this are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A param in the url&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A url stored in the session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't like the url method, it is a bit messy, and you have to remember to include the param in every relevent URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd just use an object with static methods for this. The object would wrap around the session item you use to store redirect URLS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methods would probably be as follows (all public static):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;setRedirectUrl(string URL)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;doRedirect(string defaultURL)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;setRedirectUrl would be called in any action that produces links / forms which need to redirect to a given url. So say you had a projects view action that generates a list of projects, each with tasks that can be performed on them (e.g. delete, edit) you would call RedirectClass.setRedirectUrl("/project/view-all") in the code for this action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then lets say the user clicks delete, they need to be redirected to the view page after a delete action, so in the delete action you would call RedirectClass.setRedirectUrl("/project/view-all"). This method would look to see if the redirect variable was set in the session. If so redirect to that URL. If not, redirect to the default url (the string passed to the setRedirectUrl method).&lt;/p&gt;

For just getting started the emulator is very good. You're going to use the emulator during development most of the time anyway so if you're just figuring things out it is fine to use just that. You can also tweak the emulator to emulate the specific hardware you want to use (add io ports etc.) so if you're not clear on what you want to do or what you need this is a good way to try stuff out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know exactly what you want to build it might be a good idea to think about what hardware you're going to need as soon as possible. There are some developer boards out there for the microframework that you might use for sideshow. Or if you've got specific needs you might end up developing your own hardware and porting the microframework to it. I don't really know what you need so I can't recommend a specific hardware platform. There are some examples on the microsoft microframework site that you might want to look at. &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/embedded/bb267253.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/embedded/bb267253.aspx&lt;/a&gt; look under the heading developer kits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;div#wrapper { position: relative; }
div#legend { position: absolute; bottom: 0px; right: 0px; }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;position: relative&lt;/code&gt; will cause any contained elements to be positioned relative to the &lt;code&gt;#wrapper&lt;/code&gt; container, and &lt;code&gt;position: absolute&lt;/code&gt; will cause the &lt;code&gt;#legend&lt;/code&gt; div to be "pulled" out of the flow and sit above the map, keeping it's bottom right edge at the bottom of the &lt;code&gt;#wrapper&lt;/code&gt; and stretching as required to contain the marker descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the "single point of exit" theory, you inevitably wind up with code that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function()

    {
        if(SUCCEEDED(Operation2()))

    }
    else
    {
        error = OPERATION1FAILED;
    }

    return error;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only does this make the code very hard to follow, but now say later on you need to go back and add an operation in between 1 and 2.  You have to indent just about the entire freaking function, and good luck making sure all of your if/else conditions and braces are matched up properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FMP 9 supports SQL-92 standard syntax (mostly). Note that rather than querying tables directly you query using the "table occurrence" name which serves as a table alias of sorts. If the data tables are stored in multiple files it is possible to create a single FMP file with table occurrences/aliases pointing to those data tables. There's an "undocumented feature" where such a file must have a table defined in it as well and that table "related" to any other table on the relationships graph (doesn't matter which one) for ODBC access to work. Otherwise your queries will always return no results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PDF document details all of the limitations of using the xDBC interface FMP provides. Performance of simple queries is reasonably fast, ymmv. I have found the performance of queries specifying the "LIKE" operator to be less than stellar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FMP also has an XML/XSLT interface that you can use to query FMP data over an HTTP connection. It also provides a PHP class for accessing and using FMP data in web applications.&lt;/p&gt;

This was a pretty good backup system, and allowed me easily work on any of the machines. I could checkout a specific project, commit and it updated the 'master' project, or I could checkout the entire thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I have a bunch of git repositories, for various projects, several of which are on github. I also have the SVN repository I mentioned, imported via the git-svn command..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, I like having all my code (not just projects, but random snippets and scripts, some things like my CV, articles I've written, websites I've made and so on) in one big repository I can easily clone onto remote machines, or memory-sticks/harddrives as backup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is, since it's a private repository, and git doesn't allow checking out of a specific folder (that I could push to github as a separate project, but have the changes appear in both the master-repo, and the sub-repos)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; use the git submodule system, but it doesn't act how I want it too (submodules are pointers to other repositories, and don't really contain the actual code, so it's useless for backup)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I have a folder of git-repos (for example, ~/code_projects/proj1/.git/ ~/code_projects/proj2/.git/), and after doing changes to proj1 I do &lt;code&gt;git push github&lt;/code&gt;, then I copy the files into ~/Documents/code/python/projects/proj1/ and do a single commit (instead of the numerous ones in the individual repos). Then do &lt;code&gt;git push backupdrive1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;git push mymemorystick&lt;/code&gt; etc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the question: How do your personal code and projects with git repositories, and keep them synced and backed-up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If using multiple exit points during input validation or resource allocation, I try to put all the 'error-exits' very visibly at the top of the function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the &lt;a href="http://ssdl-wiki.cs.technion.ac.il/wiki/index.php/Spartan%5Fprogramming" rel="nofollow"&gt;Spartan Programming&lt;/a&gt; article of the "SSDSLPedia" and &lt;a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SingleFunctionExitPoint" rel="nofollow"&gt;the single function exit point&lt;/a&gt; article of the "Portland Pattern Repository's Wiki" have some insightful arguments around this. Also, of course, there is &lt;a href="#36711" rel="nofollow"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you really want a single exit-point (in any non-exception-enabled language) for example in order to release resources in one single place, I find the careful application of goto to be good; see for example this rather contrived example (compressed to save screen real-estate):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int f(int y) {
    int value = -1;
    void *data = NULL;

    if (y &amp;lt; 0)
        goto clean;

    if ((data = malloc(123)) == NULL)
        goto clean;

    /* More code */

    value = 1;
clean:
   free(data);
   return value;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I, in general, dislike arrow programming more than I dislike multiple exit-points, although both are useful when applied correctly. The best, of course, is to structure your program to require neither. Breaking down your function into multiple chunks usually help :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although when doing so, I find I end up with multiple exit points anyway as in this example, where some larger function has been broken down into several smaller functions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int g(int y) {
  value = 0;

  if ((value = g0(y, value)) == -1)
    return -1;

  if ((value = g1(y, value)) == -1)
    return -1;

  return g2(y, value);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the project or coding guidelines, most of the boiler-plate code could be replaced by macros. As a side note, breaking it down this way makes the functions g0, g1 ,g2 very easy to test individually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, in an OO and exception-enabled language, I wouldn't use if-statements like that (or at all, if I could get away with it with little enough effort), and the code would be much more plain. And non-arrowy. And most of the non-final returns would probably be exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Few returns are better than many returns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More than one return is better than huge arrows, and &lt;a href="http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/replaceNestedConditionalWithGuardClauses.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;guard clauses&lt;/a&gt; are generally ok.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exceptions could/should probably replace most 'guard clauses' when possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You could use something like subversion, but it is going to upload a whole new copy of the document, instead of a changeset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was under the impression SVN stored byte-level diffs, which makes it possible for it to store incremental changes to binary files such as Word docs and pictures, as well as text files.  How to meaningfully represent those changes in a diff is another question, but underneath the hood I think SVN stores changesets for binaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Working copies are sticky to a branch by definition, as changing to a different branch means changing the base-Subversion-URL used to access the repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However sticky-revision files... that's not a concept that Subversion has.&lt;br /&gt;
See:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/re28.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Subversion update command reference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One workaround might be to manually return the file to a specific revision after doing an update. Perhaps putting something like the following into a script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;svn update
svn update -r1234 that/particular/file.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another workaround, as tweakt suggests, is to have a partial branch with just one file in it. This needs very careful management though and things can get a bit.. er... sticky :-)
, if you're not vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;

You can also use AJAX to insert the new messages, giving the user read/write access to this messages data structure.

I'll simply store the indexes to the

array.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boundaries between the asymmetric, moderate, and symmetric regions will depend on the time required by the various algorithms balanced against the space they need, where the relative value of time versus space would be an adjustable parameter. The space needed for Huffman coding is a function of the symmetry, and I'll profile that with testing. Also, I'll test all three methods to determine the time requirements of my implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's possible (and actually I'm hoping) that the middle compression method will always be better than the list or the bit array or both. Maybe I can encourage this by choosing a set of Huffman codes adapted for higher or lower symmetry. Then I can simplify the system and just use two methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is once you pass an object reference out containing non-final, public fields. Anything else with that reference is free to modify those fields. You no longer have any control over the state of that object. (Think what would happen if Strings were mutable.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gets bad when that object is an important part of the internal state of another, you've just exposed internal implementation. To prevent this, a copy of the object must be returned instead. This works, but can cause massive GC pressure from tons of single-use copies created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have public fields, consider making the class read-only. Add the fields as parameters to the constructor, and mark the fields final. Otherwise make sure you're not exposing internal state, and if you need to construct new instances for a return value, make sure it won't be called excessively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See: "&lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/effective/"&gt;Effective Java&lt;/a&gt;" by Joshua Bloch -- Item #13: Favor Immutability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: Also keep in mind, all JVMs these days will optimize away the getMethod if possible, resulting in just a single field-read instruction. &lt;/p&gt;

This explanation will follow a simplistic implementation of closures in Scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, I must introduce the concept of a namespace. When you enter a command into a Scheme interpreter, it must evaluate the various symbols in the expression and obtain their value. Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(define x 3)

(define y 4)

(+ x y) returns 7
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The define expressions store the value 3 in the spot for x and the value 4 in the spot for y. Then when we call (+ x y), the interpreter looks up the values in the namespace and is able to perform the operation and return 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in Scheme there are expressions that allow you to temporarily override the value of a symbol. Here's an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(define x 3)

(define y 4)

(let ((x 5))
   (+ x y)) returns 9

x returns 3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the let keyword does is introduces a new namespace with x as the value 5. You will notice that it's still able to see that y is 4, making the sum returned to be 9. You can also see that once the expression has ended x is back to being 3. In this sense, x has been temporarily masked by the local value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procedural and object-oriented languages have a similar concept. Whenever you declare a variable in a function that has the same name as a global variable you get the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would we implement this? A simple way is with a linked list - the head contains the new value and the tail contains the old namespace. When you need to look up a symbol, you start at the head and work your way down the tail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's skip to the implementation of first-class functions for the moment. More or less, a function is a set of instructions to execute when the function is called culminating in the return value. When we read in a function, we can store these instructions behind the scenes and run them when the function is called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(define x 3)

(define (plus-x y)
  (+ x y))

(let ((x 5))
  (plus-x 4)) returns ?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We define x to be 3 and plus-x to be its parameter, y, plus the value of x. Finally we call plus-x in an environment where x has been masked by a new x, this one valued 5. If we merely store the operation, (+ x y), for the function plus-x, since we're in the context of x being 5 the result returned would be 9. This is what's called dynamic scoping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Scheme, Common Lisp, and many other languages have what's called lexical scoping - in addition to storing the operation (+ x y) we also store the namespace at that particular point. That way, when we're looking up the values we can see that x, in this context, is really 3. This is a closure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(define x 3)

(define (plus-x y)
  (+ x y))

(let ((x 5))
  (plus-x 4)) returns 7
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, we can use a linked list to store the state of the namespace at the time of function definition, allowing us to access variables from enclosing scopes, as well as providing us the ability to locally mask a variable without affecting the rest of the program.&lt;/p&gt;

We have had several cases with ~25,000 rows, which works relatively smoothly, but a potential customer needs to have many times that much in a single list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To figure out how well we scale right now, and how (and how far) we can realistically improve, I'd like to implement a simulation: instead of displaying actual data, have the SQL Server send fictional, random data. The client and transport side would be mostly the same; the view(or at least the underlying table) would of course work differently. The user specifies the amount of fictional rows (e.g. 100,000).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the time being, I just want to know how long it takes for the client to retrieve and process the data and is just about ready to display it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I'm trying to figure out is this: how do I make the SQL Server send such data?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a stored procedure that has to be run beforehand to fill an actual table?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a function that I point the view to, thus having the server generate the data 'live'?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Somehow replicate and/or randomize existing data?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first option sounds to me like it would yield the results closest to the real world. Because the data is actually 'physically there', the &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; query would be quite similar performance-wise to one on real data. However, it taxes the server with an otherwise meaningless operation. The fake data would also be backed up, as it would live in one and the same database  unless, of course, I delete the data after each benchmark run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second and third option tax the server &lt;em&gt;while&lt;/em&gt; running the actual simulation, thus potentially giving unrealistically slow results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I'm unsure how to create those rows, short of using a loop or cursor. I can use &lt;code&gt;SELECT top &amp;lt;n&amp;gt; random1(), random2(), [] FROM foo&lt;/code&gt; if &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; actually happens to have &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;n&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; entries, but otherwise I'll (obviously) only get as many rows as &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; happens to have. A &lt;code&gt;GROUP BY newid()&lt;/code&gt; or similar doesn't appear to do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The windows forms implementation is pretty good now.  (See &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/paint-mono/"&gt;Paint-Mono&lt;/a&gt; for a port of Paint.net which is a pretty involved Windows forms application.  All that was required was an emulation layer for some of the P-Invoke and unsupported system calls).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Path.Combine as well as Path.Seperator to join paths and filenames.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The windows Registry is OK, as long as you are only using it for storing and retrieving data from your applications (i.e. you can't get any information about Windows from it, since it is basically a registry for Mono applications).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Xinc's case, I hope you used PEAR to install it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;pear list-files xinc/Xinc
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should do it, and show you where your Xinc install put its files. So even though Xinc is "just" one big PHP script, it's still spread out into rc scripts and all those other things which are necessary to make an application run. I'm sure you don't need to add all paths listed there, but probably some in order to make it run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from Xinc itself, I think it also needs phpUnit and a bunch of other PEAR libs to run, so what I'd propose is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;pear config-get php_dir
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then you need to add that path (like Henrik suggested) to the chroot environment.&lt;/p&gt;

  refuse to compile, or don't seem to work properly. Has anyone got any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write one. You're best off picking a nice, simple instruction set (Z80 should be perfect). I remember doing this as a first-year undergraduate exercise - I think we wrote the simulator in C++ and simulated 6800 assembly, but really any language/instruction set will do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of "learning assembly language" these days is to get the idea of how computers work at the lowest level, only a select few (compiler writers, etc.) have any real reason to actually be writing assembly code these days. Modern processors are stuffed full of features designed to be used by compilers to help optimise code for speed/concurrent execution/power consumption/etc., and trying to write assembly by hand for a modern processor would be a nightmare. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't fret about getting your application production-ready unless you want to - in all likelihood the bits of software you've found so far were written by people exactly like you who wanted to figure out how assembly works and wrote their own simulator, then realised how much work would be involved in getting it "production ready" so the general public could use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;\set myvariable '\'somestring\''  
SELECT * FROM foo WHERE bar = :myvariable
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

I have been playing around with the Windows API and came across a couple of examples on how to initialize create windows and such. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example creates a regular window (I abbreviated some of the code):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    int WINAPI WinMain( [...] )
    {

    [...]

    // Windows Class setup
    wndClass.cbSize = sizeof( wndClass );
    wndClass.style  = CS_HREDRAW | CS_VREDRAW;
    [...]    

    // Register class
    RegisterClassEx( &amp;wndClass );

    // Create window
    hWnd = CreateWindow( szAppName, "Win32 App",
                         WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW,
                         0, 0, 512, 384,
                         NULL, NULL, hInstance, NULL );
    [...]
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second example creates a dialog box (no abbreviations except the WinMain arguments):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    int WINAPI WinMain( [...] )
    {
      // Create dialog box
      DialogBox(hInstance, 
                MAKEINTRESOURCE(IDD_MAIN_DLG), 
                NULL, 
                (DLGPROC)DialogProc);
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second example does not contain any call to the register function. It just creates the DialogBox with its DialogProc process attached. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works fine, but I am wondering if there is a benefit of registering the window class and then creating the dialog box (if this is at all possible). &lt;/p&gt;

Git repository.  The overhead of creating new repositories is quite
low, and that is a &lt;em&gt;feature&lt;/em&gt; that makes it possible to keep
different lineages completely separate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fighting that idea means ending up with unnecessarily tangled history,
which renders administration more difficult and--more
importantly--"archeology" tools less useful because of the resulting
dilution.  Also, as you mentioned, Git assumes that the "unit of
cloning" is the repository, and practically has to do so because of
its distributed nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One solution is to keep every project/package/etc. as its own &lt;em&gt;bare&lt;/em&gt;
repository (i.e., without working tree) under a blessed hierarchy,
like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/repos/a.git
/repos/b.git
/repos/c.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a few conventions have been established, it becomes trivial to
apply administrative operations (backup, packing, web publishing) to
the complete hierarchy, which serves a role not entirely dissimilar to
"monolithic" SVN repositories.  Working with these repositories also
becomes somewhat similar to SVN workflows, with the addition that one
&lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; use local commits and branches:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;svn checkout   --&amp;gt; git clone
svn update     --&amp;gt; git pull
svn commit     --&amp;gt; git push
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can have multiple remotes in each working clone, for the ease of
synchronizing between the multiple parties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cd ~/dev
$ git clone /repos/foo.git       # or the one from github, ...
$ cd foo
$ git remote add github ...
$ git remote add memorystick ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can then fetch/pull from each of the "sources", work and commit
locally, and then push ("backup") to each of these remotes when you
are ready with something like (note how that pushes the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; commits
and history to each of the remotes!):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ for remote in origin github memorystick; do git push $remote; done
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to turn an existing working repository &lt;code&gt;~/dev/foo&lt;/code&gt;
into such a bare repository is probably:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cd ~/dev
$ git clone --bare foo /repos/foo.git
$ mv foo foo.old
$ git clone /repos/foo.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which is mostly equivalent to a &lt;code&gt;svn import&lt;/code&gt;--but does not throw the
existing, "local" history away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: &lt;em&gt;submodules&lt;/em&gt; are a mechanism to include shared &lt;em&gt;related&lt;/em&gt;
lineages, so I indeed wouldn't consider them an appropriate tool for
the problem you are trying to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two good reasons from where I sit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistency - you're always doing the same thing with a dialog and the very nature of the question suggests that patterns are good (-: Although equally the question is whether this is a good pattern?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It allows for return of multiple values from the dialog - ok there's whole new discussion here too but applied pragmatism means that this is what one wants in some circumstances its not always appropriate or desirable to package values up just so that you can pass them back in all in one go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flow of logic is nice too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (Dialog == Ok)
{
    // Do Stuff with the entered values
}
else
{
    // Respond appropriately to the user cancelling the dialog
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider a simple function that adds the first N integers. (e.g. &lt;code&gt;sum(5) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a simple Python implementation that uses recursion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;def recsum(x):
 if x == 1:
  return x
 else:
  return x + recsum(x - 1)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you called &lt;code&gt;recsum(5)&lt;/code&gt;, this is what the Python interpreter would evaluate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;recsum(5)
5 + recsum(4)
5 + (4 + recsum(3))
5 + (4 + (3 + recsum(2)))
5 + (4 + (3 + (2 + recsum(1))))
5 + (4 + (3 + (2 + 1)))
15
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note how every recursive call has to complete before the Python interpreter begins to actually do the work of calculating the sum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a tail-recursive version of the same function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;def tailrecsum(x, running_total=0):
  if x == 0:
    return running_total
  else:
    return tailrecsum(x - 1, running_total + x)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the sequence of events that would occur if you called &lt;code&gt;tailrecsum(5)&lt;/code&gt;, (which would effectively be &lt;code&gt;tailrecsum(5, 0)&lt;/code&gt;, because of the default second argument).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;tailrecsum(5, 0)
tailrecsum(4, 5)
tailrecsum(3, 9)
tailrecsum(2, 12)
tailrecsum(1, 14)
tailrecsum(0, 15)
15
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the tail-recursive case, with each evaluation of the recursive call, the &lt;code&gt;running_total&lt;/code&gt; is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: As mentioned in the comments, Python doesn't have built-in support for optimizing away tail calls, so there's no advantage to doing this in Python. However, you can use a &lt;a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/474088/"&gt;decorator&lt;/a&gt; to achieve the optimization.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Should you ever use protected member variables? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depends on how picky you are about hiding state. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don't want any leaking of internal state, then declaring all your member variables private is the way to go. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don't really care that subclasses can access internal state, then protected is good enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a developer comes along and subclasses your class they may mess it up because they don't understand it fully.  With private members, other than the public interface, they can't see the implementation specific details of how things are being done which gives you the flexibility of changing it later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no real advantages or disadvantages to protected member variables, it's a question of what you need in your specific situation. In general it is accepted practice to declare member variables as private and enable outside access through properties. Also, some tools (e.g. some O/R mappers) expect object data to be represented by properties and do not recognize public or protected member variables. But if you know that you want your subclasses (and ONLY your subclasses) to access a certain variable there is no reason not to declare it as protected.&lt;/p&gt;

This was (to my mind) rather overblown and over-engineered, but did the job quite well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence it used a "stub loader" to check a manifest and a Web service to see if a later version of the program than the one installed was available, then used the BITS background downloader technology to download a new version if one was available on the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the new version was downloaded and installed (with .NET this is as simple as an xcopy to the relevant folder), the application would update the manifest. The next time the program was loaded the new version would be launched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Patterns + Practices code is .NET specific, there's nothing there that couldn't be copied for a non-.NET application, especially if you have the ability to silently run the install process in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

First it will "wrap" ( or otherwise convert) a value of one type into another type (typically called a "monadic type"). Secondly it will make all the operations ( or functions ) available on the underlying type available on the monadic type. Finally it will provide support for combining its self with another monad to produce a composite monad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "maybe monad" is essentially the equivalent of "nullable types" in VB / C#. It takes a non nullable type "T" and converts it into a "Nullable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;", and then defines what all the binary operators mean on a Nullable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side effects are represented simillarly. A structure is created that holds descriptions of side effects along side a function's return value. The "lifted" operations then copy around side effects as values are passed between functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The are called "monads" rather than the easier to grasp name of "type operators" for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monads have restrictions on what they can do (see the definiton for details).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those restrictions, along with the fact that there are 3 operations involved, conform to the structure of something called a monad in Category Theory, which is an obscure branch of mathematics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They were designed by proponents of "pure" functional languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proponents of pure functional languages like obscure branches of mathematics&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conditions are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The protocol is asynchronous&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A third party can modify the data at any time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The command round-trip can be significant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The model should be well suited for UI interaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The protocol supports queries over certain objects, and so must the model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a means of improving my lacking skills in this area (and brush up my Java in general), I have started a &lt;a href="http://Telharmonium.devjavu.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; to create an Eclipse-based front-end for &lt;a href="http://xmms2.xmms.se" rel="nofollow"&gt;xmms2&lt;/a&gt; (described below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the question is; how should I expose the remote interface as a neat data model (In this case, track management and event handling)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I welcome anything from generic discussions to pattern name-dropping or concrete examples and patches :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My primary goal here is learning about this class of problems in general. If my project can gain from it, fine, but I present it strictly to have something to start a discussion around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've implemented a protocol abstraction which I call &lt;a href="http://telharmonium.devjavu.com/browser/trunk/xmms2-client" rel="nofollow"&gt;'client'&lt;/a&gt; (for legacy reasons) which allows me to access most exposed features using method calls which I am happy with even if it's far from perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The features provided by the xmms2 daemon are things like track searching, meta-data retrieval and manipulation, change playback state, load playlists and so on and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm in the middle of updating to the latest stable release of xmms2, and I figured I might as well fix some of the glaring weaknesses of my current implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan is to build a better abstraction on top of the protocol interface, one that allows a more natural interaction with the daemon. The current &lt;a href="http://telharmonium.devjavu.com/browser/trunk/xmms2-model" rel="nofollow"&gt;'model'&lt;/a&gt; implementation is hard to use and is frankly quite ugly (not to mention the UI-code which is truly horrible atm).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I have the &lt;a href="http://telharmonium.devjavu.com/browser/trunk/xmms2-model/src/se/fnord/xmms2/model/Tracks.java" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tracks&lt;/a&gt; interface which I can use to get instances of &lt;a href="http://telharmonium.devjavu.com/browser/trunk/xmms2-model/src/se/fnord/xmms2/model/Track.java" rel="nofollow"&gt;Track&lt;/a&gt; classes based on their id. Searching is performed through the &lt;a href="http://telharmonium.devjavu.com/browser/trunk/xmms2-model/src/se/fnord/xmms2/model/Collections.java" rel="nofollow"&gt;Collections&lt;/a&gt; interface (unfortunate namespace clash) which I'd rather move to Tracks, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any data can be modified by a third party at any time, and this should be properly reflected in the model and change-notifications distributed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These interfaces are exposed when connecting, by returning an object hierarchy that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connection
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Playback getPlayback()
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play, pause, jump, current track etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expose playback state changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tracks getTracks()
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track getTrack(id) etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expose track updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collections getCollection()
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load and manipulate playlists or named collections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Query media library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expose collection updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

If 5 work objects are available at once and you have 5 consumer objects, it would make sense to wake up all threads using notifyAll() so each one can process 1 work object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have just one work object available, what is the point in waking up all consumer objects to race for that one object? The first one checking for available work will get it and all other threads will check and find they have nothing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The notify() method is generally used
  for &lt;strong&gt;resource pools&lt;/strong&gt;, where there
  are an arbitrary number of "consumers"
  or "workers" that take resources, but
  when a resource is added to the pool,
  only one of the waiting consumers or
  workers can deal with it. The
  notifyAll() method is actually used in
  most other cases. Strictly, it is
  required to notify waiters of a
  condition that could allow multiple
  waiters to proceed. But this is often
  difficult to know. So as a general
  rule, &lt;strong&gt;if you have no particular
  logic for using notify(), then you
  should probably use notifyAll()&lt;/strong&gt;,
  because it is often difficult to know
  exactly what threads will be waiting
  on a particular object and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, all waiting threads can take useful action once the wait finishes. An example would be a set of threads waiting for a certain task to finish; once the task has finished, all waiting threads can continue with their business. In such a case you would use &lt;b&gt;notifyAll()&lt;/b&gt; to wake up all waiting threads at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another case, for example mutually exclusive locking, only one of the waiting threads can do something useful after being notified (in this case acquire the lock). In such a case, you would rather use &lt;b&gt;notify()&lt;/b&gt;. Properly implemented, you &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; use &lt;b&gt;notifyAll()&lt;/b&gt; in this situation as well, but you would unnecessarily wake threads that can't do anything anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;strong&gt;notify()&lt;/strong&gt; if all your waiting threads are interchangeable (the order they wake up doesn't matter), or if you only ever have one waiting thread. A common example is a thread pool used to execute jobs from a queue--when a job is added, one of threads is notified to wake up, execute the next job and go back to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Therefore non-temporal stores must be followed by an SFENCE instruction in order for their results to be seen by other processors in a timely fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When data is produced and not (immediately) consumed again, the fact that memory store operations read a full cache line first and then modify the cached data is detrimental to performance. This operation pushes data out of the caches which might be needed again in favor of data which will not be used soon. This is especially true for large data structures, like matrices, which are filled and then used later. Before the last element of the matrix is filled the sheer size evicts the first elements, making caching of the writes ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this and similar situations, processors provide support for non-temporal write operations. Non-temporal in this context means the data will not be reused soon, so there is no reason to cache it. These non-temporal write operations do not read a cache line and then modify it; instead, the new content is directly written to memory. &lt;/p&gt;

The future interface is used to represent objects which are not ready yet, but are beeing created in a seperate thread. You say that objects can be modified at any time by a third party, but I would still suggest you use immutable return objects here, and instead have a seperate thread/event log you can subscribe to to get noticed when objects expire. I have little programming with UIs, but I believe using Futures for asynchronus calls would let you have a responsive gui, rather than one that was waiting for a server reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the queries I would suggest using method chaining to build the query object, and each object returned by method chaining should be Iterable. Similar to how Djangos model is. Say you have QuerySet which implements Iterable. You can then call allSongs() which would return a result iterating over all Songs. Or allSongs().artist("Beatles"), and you would have an iterable over all Betles songs. Or even allSongs().artist("Beatles").years(1965,1967) and so on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps as a starting place.&lt;/p&gt;

It is better that way because you usually have many more threads than you have processors available, so the operating system needs to do time-slicing to give all threads a chance to run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, you can set threads priorities if you have a critical task, and a threading API usually provides this possibility.

&lt;p&gt;The two answers and a little thought got me to something approaching an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First a little more clarification:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app is written in C# (2.0+) and uses ADO.NET to talk to SQL Server 2005.
The mirror setup is two W2k3 servers hosting the Principal and the Mirror plus a third server hosting an express instance as a monitor. The nice thing about this is a failover is all but transparent to the app using the database, it will throw an error for some connections but fundamentally everything will carry on nicely. Yes we're getting the odd false positive but the whole point is to have the system carry on working with the least amount of fuss and mirror &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; deliver this very nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, the issue is not with serious server failure - that's usually a bit more obvious but with a failover for other reasons (c.f. the false positives above) as we do have a couple of things that can't, for various reasons, fail over and in any case so we can see if we can identify the circumstance where we get false positives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, given the above, simply checking the status of the boxes is not quite enough and chasing through the event log is probably overly complex - the answer is, as it turns out, fairly simple: sp_helpserver&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first column returned by sp_helpserver is the server name. If you run the request at regular intervals saving the &lt;em&gt;previous&lt;/em&gt; server name and doing a comparison each time you'll be able to identify when a change has taken place and then take the appropriate action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is a console app that demonstrates the principal - although it needs some work (e.g. the connection ought to be non-pooled and new each time) but its enough for now (so I'd then accept this as "the" answer"). Parameters are Principal, Mirror, Database&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;using System;
using System.Data.SqlClient;

namespace FailoverMonitorConcept
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string server = args[0];
            string failover = args[1];
            string database = args[2];

            string connStr = string.Format("Integrated Security=SSPI;Persist Security Info=True;Data Source={0};Failover Partner={1};Packet Size=4096;Initial Catalog={2}", server, failover, database);
            string sql = "EXEC sp_helpserver";

            SqlConnection dc = new SqlConnection(connStr);
            SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(sql, dc);
            Console.WriteLine("Connection string: " + connStr);
            Console.WriteLine("Press any key to test, press q to quit");

            string priorServerName = "";
            char key = ' ';

            while(key.ToString().ToLower() != "q")
            {
                dc.Open();
                try
                {
                    string serverName = cmd.ExecuteScalar() as string;
                    Console.WriteLine(DateTime.Now.ToLongTimeString() + " - Server name: " + serverName);
                    if (priorServerName == "")
                    {
                        priorServerName = serverName;
                    }
                    else if (priorServerName != serverName)
                    {
                        Console.WriteLine("***** SERVER CHANGED *****");
                        Console.WriteLine("New server: " + serverName);
                        priorServerName = serverName;
                    }
                }
                catch (System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException ex)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Error: " + ex.ToString());
                }
                finally
                {
                    dc.Close();
                }

  &lt;p&gt;is there a way to choose which processor or core it is launched on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the task manager to tell windows what CPU(s) your program should be allowed to run on. Normally this is only useful for troubleshooting legacy programs which have broken implementations of multi-threading. To do this, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run task manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find your process in the &lt;code&gt;Processes&lt;/code&gt; window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right click and choose &lt;code&gt;Set Affinity...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tick the checkboxes next to the CPU's you want to allow your application to run on. Windows will then only schedule threads from that process onto those particular CPU's&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I recall correctly, windows will 'remember' these settings for subsequent times your process is run, but please don't quote me on that - run some tests yourself :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also do this programatically in .NET after your program has launched using using the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.process.processoraffinity.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;System.Diagnostics.Process.ProcessorAffinity&lt;/a&gt; property, but I don't think it will 'remember' the settings, so there will always be a short period in which your app is run on whichever CPU windows sees fit. I don't know how to do this in java sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This applies at the entire process level. If you set affinity for CPU0 only, and then launch 50 threads, all 50 of those threads will run on CPU0, and CPU1, 2, 3, etc will sit around doing nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to reiterate the point, this is primarily useful for troubleshooting broken legacy software. If your software is not broken, you really shouldn't mess with any of these settings, and let windows decide the best CPU(s) to run your program on, so it can take the rest of the system's performance into account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the 'shared memory' model, it works the same, but there are more things that can go subtly wrong when your app is running on multiple CPU's as opposed to just timeslices on a single one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an eye-opening example, read &lt;a href="http://ridiculousfish.com/blog/archives/2007/02/17/barrier/" rel="nofollow"&gt;this ridiculousfish article about CPU's and Memory Barriers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's aimed at OSX development on PowerPC, but general enough that it should apply everywhere. IMHO it's one of the top ten 'all developers should read this' articles I've read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Future for the async operations is interesting. The only drawback being that it is doesn't provide callbacks. But then again, I tried that approach, and look where that got me :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm currently solving a similar problem using a worker thread and a blocking queue for dispatching the incoming command replies, but that approach doesn't translate very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remote objects can be modified, but since I do use threads, I try to keep the objects immutable. My current hypothesis is that I will send notification events on track updates on the form&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;somehandlername(int changes, Track old_track, Track new_track)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or similar, but then I might end up with several versions of the same track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll definitely look into Djangos method chaining. I've been looking at some similar constructs but haven't been able to come up with a good variant. Returning something iterable is interesting, but the query could take some time to complete, and I wouldn't want to actually execute the query before it's completely constructed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps something like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Tracks.allSongs().artist("Beatles").years(1965,1967).execute()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the bit array is not crazy long, you could try applying the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrows-Wheeler" rel="nofollow"&gt;Burrows-Wheeler transform&lt;/a&gt; before using any repetition encoding, such as Huffman.  A naive implementation would take O(n^2) memory during (de)compression and O(n^2 log n) time to decompress - there are almost certainly shortcuts to be had, as well.  But if there's any sequential structure to your data at all, this should really help the Huffman encoding out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could also apply that idea to one block at a time to keep the time/memory usage more practical.  Using one block at time could allow you to always keep most of the data structure compressed if you're reading/writing sequentially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where things get a bit more interesting for Websites is managing those files that are required for the site but don't actually form part of the site - the most obvious example being something like .psd files from which web graphics are produced but which don't get deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We therefore have a tree for each site which has two folders: assets and site. Assets are things that aren't in the site, and site is - well the site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you have to watch with this is that designers tend to have their own "systems" for "versioning" graphic files (count the layers in the PSD). You don't need necessarily to stop them doing this but you do need to ensure that they commit each change too.&lt;/p&gt;

I picked the &lt;a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dojo toolkit&lt;/a&gt;, version 1.1.1. At first, all was fine: the drag-and-drop code I wrote worked first time, you can drag tasks on-screen to change their order of precedence, and each drag-and-drop operation calls an event handler that sends an AJAX call to the server to let it know that order has been changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I went to add in the email tracking functionality. Standard stuff: new incoming emails have a unique ID number attached to their subject line, all subsequent emails about that problem can be tracked by simply leaving that ID number in the subject when you reply. So, we have a list of open tasks, each with their own ID number, and each of those tasks has a time-ordered list of associated emails. I wanted the text of those emails to be available to the user as they were looking at their list of tasks, so I made each task box a Dijit "Tree" control - top level contains the task description, branches contain email dates, and a single "leaf" off of each of those branches contains the email text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First problem: I wanted the tree view to be fully-collapsed by default. After searching Google quite extensively, I found a number of solutions, all of which seemed to be valid for previous versions of Dojo but not the one I was using. I eventually figured out that the best solution would seem to be to have a event handler called when the Tree control had loaded that simply collapsed each branch/leaf. Unfortunately, even though the Tree control had been instantiated and its "startup" event handler called, the branches and leaves still hadn't loaded (the data was still being loaded via an AJAX call). So, I modified the system so that all email text and Tree structure is added server-side. This means the whole fully-populated Tree control is available when its startup event handler is called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the startup event handler fully collapses the tree. Next, I couldn't find a "proper" way to have nice formatted text for the email leaves. I can put the email text in the leaf just fine, but any HTML gets escaped out and shows up in the web page. Cue more rummaging around Dojo's documentation (tends to be out of date, with code and examples for pre-1.0 versions) and Google. I eventually came up with the solution of getting JavaScript to go and read the SPAN element that's inside each leaf node and un-escape the escaped HTML code in it's innerHTML. I figured I'd put code to do this in with the fully-collapse-the-tree code, in the Tree control's startup event handler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However... it turns out that the SPAN element isn't actually created until the user clicks on the expando (the little "+" symbol in a tree view you click to expand a node). Okay, fair enough - I'll add the re-formatting code to the onExpand() event handler, or whatever it's called. Which doesn't seem to exist. I've searched to documentation, I've searched Google... I'm quite possibly mis-understanding Dojo's "publish/subscribe" event handling system, but I think that mainly because there doesn't seem to be any comprehensive documentation for it anywhere (like, where do I find out what events I can subscribe to?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in the end, the best solution I can come up with is to add an onClick event handler (not a "Dojo" event, but a plain JavaScript event that Dojo knows nothing about) to the expando node of each Tree branch that re-formats the HTML inside the SPAN element of each leaf. Except... when that is called, the SPAN element still doesn't exist (sometimes - other times it's been cached, just to further confuse you). Therefore, I have the event handler set up a timer that periodically calls a function that checks to see if the relevant SPAN element has turned up yet before then re-formatting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// An event handler called whenever a "email title" tree node is expanded.
function formatTreeNode(nodeID) {
    if (dijit.byId(nodeID).getChildren().length != 0) {
        clearInterval(nodeUpdateIntervalID);
        messageBody = dijit.byId(nodeID).getChildren()[0].labelNode.innerHTML
        if (messageBody.indexOf("&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Message text:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;") == -1) {
            messageBody = messageBody.replace(/&amp;amp;gt;/g, "&amp;gt;");
            messageBody = messageBody.replace(/&amp;amp;lt;/g, "&amp;lt;");
            messageBody = messageBody.replace(/&amp;amp;amp;/g, "&amp;amp;");
            dijit.byId(nodeID).getChildren()[0].labelNode.innerHTML = "&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Message text:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div style=\"font-family:courier\"&amp;gt;"+messageBody+"&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;";
        }
    }
}

// An event handler called when a tree node has been set up - we changed the default fully-expanded to fully-collapsed.
function setupTree(theTree) {
    dijit.byId("tree-"+theTree).rootNode.collapse();

    messageNode = dijit.byId("tree-"+theTree).rootNode.getChildren();
    for (pl = 0; pl &amp;lt; messageNode.length; pl++) {
        messageNode[pl].collapse();
        messageNode[pl].expandoNode.onclick = eval("nodeUpdateIntervalID = setInterval(\"formatTreeNode('"+messageNode[pl].id+"')\",200); formatTreeNode('"+messageNode[pl].id+"');");
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above has the feel of a truly horrible hack, and I feel sure I must have taken a wrong turn somewhere early on in my thought process. Can someone please tell me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The correct way to go about putting nicely-formatted text inside a Dojo/Dijit Tree control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The correct way to handle Dojo events, like where I can figure out what events are available for me to subscribe to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A better JavaScript library to use (can I do what I want to with JQuery and avoid the all-around-the-houses approach seen above?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: If you're naming a software project, give thought to its name's uniqueness in Google - I'm sure searching for "Dojo" documentation in Google would be easier without all the martial arts results getting in the way.&lt;/p&gt;

We had two services - one for read, and one for write, but only because we had multiple readers. I'm sure we could have done it with just one service (the writer) and embedded the reader in the web app and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've used lucene.net as a general database indexer, so what I got back was basically DB id's (to indexed email messages), and I've also use it to get back enough info to populate search results or such without touching the database. It's worked great in both cases, tho the SQL can get a little slow, as you pretty much have to get an ID, select an ID etc. We got around this by making a temp table (with just the ID row in it) and bulk-inserting from a file (which was the output from lucene) then joining to the message table. Was a lot quicker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucene isn't perfect, and you do have to think a little outside the relational database box, because it TOTALLY isn't one, but it's very very good at what it does. Worth a look, and, I'm told, doesn't have the "oops, sorry, you need to rebuild your index again" problems that MS SQL's FTI does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW, we were dealing with 20-50million emails (and around 1 million unique attachments), totaling about 20GB of lucene index I think, and 250+GB of SQL database + attachments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performance was fantastic, to say the least - just make sure you think about, and tweak, your merge factors (when it merges index segments). There is no issue in having more than one segment, but there can be a BIG problem if you try to merge two segments which have 1mil items in each, and you have a watcher thread which kills the process if it takes too long..... (yes, that kicked our arse for a while). So keep the max number of documents per thinggie LOW (ie, dont set it to maxint like we did!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://indyproject.org/"&gt;Indy&lt;/a&gt; components seem entirely synchronous. On the other hand, while ScktComp unit does use WSAAsyncSelect, it basically only asynchronizes a BSD-style multiplexed socket app. You get dumped in a single event callback, as if you had just returned from select() in a loop, and have to do all the state machine navigation yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The .NET situation is considerably nicer, with Socket.BeginRead / Socket.EndRead, where the continuation is passed directly to Socket.BeginRead, and that's where you pick back up. A continuation coded as a closure obviously has all the context you need, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children are all different - some are quick learners, some aren't. In particular, some have better literacy skills than others, and that definitely makes a difference to the speed at which they'll pick up programming. I bet that most of us here, as professional computer programmers and the kind of people who read and post to forums for fun, learnt to read at a pretty young age. For those kinds of children, and if it's your own child who you can teach one-on-one, you could do worse than JavaScript - it has the advantage that you can do real stuff with it right away, and the edit-test cycle is simply hitting "refresh" in the browser. It gets confusing when you start to run in to how JavaScript does everything asynchronously, and is tricky to debug, but for a bright child under close tuition these problems can be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LEGO Mindstorms is definitely up there at the top of the list. Most schools now super-glue the bricks together to create pre-made models that can't have bits nicked off of them, but this shouldn't be a problem at home. Over on the Times Educational Supplement site (website forum for the UK's weekly teaching newspaper), the "what programming language is best for children?" topic comes up pretty regularly. Lots of recommendations over there for Scratch as an alternative to Mindstorms - bit more freedom than Mindstorms, again probably better for the brighter student who could also be given a soldering iron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've found that slower pupils can still have problems with Mindstorms, even though the programming environment is "graphical" - there's still a lot going on on screen, and there's a fair bit to remember (this was an older version, mind - haven't tried the snazzy new one yet). In my experience, the best all-round introduction to programming is probably still LOGO - actually a considerably more powerful language than most people give it credit for. The original &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0465046290" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mindstorms&lt;/a&gt; book by Seymour Papert (nothing to do with LEGO - they nicked the title of the book for their product), one of the originators of LOGO, is the canonical reference for teaching programming to children as a "thinking skill" and for the concept of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructionist_learning" rel="nofollow"&gt;Constructionism&lt;/a&gt; in learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've had classes of 7 or 8 year-olds programming LOGO. Note that we aren't aiming to make them "software developers", that's a career path they can decide on at some point post-16. At a young age we're trying to get them to think of "computer programming" as just another tool - how to set out a problem to be solved by a computer, in the same way they might use a mind map to help them organise and remember stuff for an exam. No poor child should be sat down and drilled in the minutia and use of a particular language, they should be left to explore and figure stuff out as they like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;More or less you'll be able to plug your treesurgeon script in as your build script, and point CCNET at that as an executable task to run the compilation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of documentation and very easy to set up nunit, ncover, fxcop, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taskbar app that will let you know the status of your projects at any time, and it can also fire off an email or keep an RSS feed with the same information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I'd definitely go with running a CI build on every check-in - for the most part will run the unit tests before checking in, but let the CCNET server handle run any applications/assemblies that would have dependencies on the assembly we're checking in, and they get re-built, and re-tested on every checkin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given it's free and takes very little time to set up - I'd highly recommend just going for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use it as part of a hosted service from &lt;a href="http://www.dimdim.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;DimDim&lt;/a&gt; themselves, and also has an open source version that you can download and run yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not used it in the last six months or so, but we did find it very useful for collaborating in a multimedia-style classroom, but like all media streaming, does require a decent broadband connection both on the server and client end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One further issue we discovered with it was that to avoid a lot of messy firewall issues (especially at educational institutions) you need to run it on its own machine on port 80, so if it is running in collaboration with another website (such as Moodle), you need a separate machine for DimDim and for Moodle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, to avoid a lot of technical issues that existed a year ago (but have probably been resolved), the project I was working on went with a hosted service at the time, but it is expected that it will end up running its own versions for control and cost reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It works. I have no idea why, but it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For future reference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works because Apache processes alias directives in order, and uses the first match. It was always hitting &lt;code&gt;Alias /&lt;/code&gt;, which will match anything, before &lt;code&gt;WSGIScriptAlias&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;First, all Redirects are processed before Aliases are processed, and therefore a request that matches a &lt;code&gt;Redirect&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;RedirectMatch&lt;/code&gt; will never have Aliases applied. Second, the Aliases and Redirects are processed in the order they appear in the configuration files, with the first match taking precedence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might want to investigate writing a small windows app in .net which adds a notify icon and can then do fancy popups or balloon popups or whatever, when they get new messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the record, I'm pretty sure that (other than using an alert/prompt dialog box) you can't flash the taskbar in JS, as this is heavily windows specific, and JS really doesn't work like that. You may be able to use some IE-specific windows activex controls, but then you inflict IE upon your poor users. Don't do that :-(&lt;/p&gt;

From experience, this is certainly a good decision, as there were some really terrible un-maintainable macros created back when I was doing a lot of C/C++. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, there are a number of scenarios where I could find a slightly more flexible pre-processor to be useful. Code such as the following could be improved by some simple pre-processor directives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public string MyProperty
{
  get { return _myProperty; }
  set
  {
    if (value != _myProperty)
    {
      _myProperty = value;
      NotifyPropertyChanged("MyProperty");
      // This line above could be improved by replacing the literal string with
      // a pre-processor directive like "#Property", which could be translated
      // to the string value "MyProperty" This new notify call would be as follows:
      // NotifyPropertyChanged(#Property);
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would it be a good idea to write a pre-processor to handle extremely simple cases like this? Steve McConnell wrote in &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0735619670"&gt;Code Complete&lt;/a&gt; (p208):&lt;/p&gt;

After three years, our project to migrate a codebase to a new platform (a project I was on for 1.5 years, but my team lead was on for only a few months) went live. He, along with senior management of both my company and the client (I'm one of those god-awful consultants you hear so much about. My engagement is an "Application Outsourcing") declared the project to be a success. I disagreed, stating that old presentations I had found showed that compared to the original schedule, the delay in deployment was best measured in months and could potentially be measured in years. I explained what I know of project failure, and the studies and statistics behind failure rates. He responded that that was all academia, and that no project he led had failed, thanks to the wonders of change/risk management - what seems to come down to explaining delays and re-evaluating the schedule based on new data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe consulting like this differs from other projects, but it seems like this is just failure wrapped up in a prettier name to avoid the stigma of having failed to deliver on time, on budget, or with full functionality. The fact that he explained that my company gave away hours of work for free in order to finish the project within the maxed out budget says a lot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I ask you this:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

I wasn't asking about a blame game with the consultants, especially since in this case I &lt;em&gt;represent&lt;/em&gt; the consultants. I was looking for views on when a project should be considered "failed" regardless of if the needed functionality &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; finally implemented.&lt;br /&gt;
I'm looking for the difference between "this is actually a little more complex than we thought, and it's going to be another week" which I'd expect is somewhat typical, and "project failure" - however you want to define failure. Is there even a difference? Does this minor level of schedule slippage constitute statistical "project failure?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;pick deadbee The oneline of this commit
pick fa1afe1 The oneline of the next commit
...&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The oneline descriptions are purely for your pleasure; git-rebase will not look at them but at the commit names ("deadbee" and "fa1afe1" in this example), so do not delete or edit the names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By replacing the command "pick" with the command "edit", you can tell git-rebase to stop after applying that commit, so that you can edit the files and/or the commit message, amend the commit, and continue rebasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to fold two or more commits into one, replace the command "pick" with "squash" for the second and subsequent commit. If the commits had different authors, it will attribute the squashed commit to the author of the first commit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some thoughts I've had were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roll my own serializer using DataOutputStream&lt;/strong&gt;:  This would give me the greatest control of what was in the file, but at the cost of micromanaging it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Straight old Serialization using ObjectOutputStream and its various related classes&lt;/strong&gt;: I'm not sold on it though since I find the data brittle.  Changing any object's structure breaks the serialized instances of it.  So I'm locked in to what seems to be a horrible versioning nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XML Serialization&lt;/strong&gt;: It's not as brittle, but it's significantly slower that straight out serialization.  It can be transformed outside of my program.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JavaDB&lt;/strong&gt;: I'd considered this since I'm comfortable writing JDBC applications. The difference here is that the database instance would only persist while the file was being opened or saved.  It's not pretty but... it does lend itself to migrating to a central server architecture if the need arises later and it introduces the possibility of quering the datamodel in a simpler way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm curious to see what other people think. And I'm hoping that I've missed some obvious, and simpler approach than the ones above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've only single core machines at home, but ran a Java equivalent of your BitArray sieve, and a single threaded version of the inversion of the sieve - holding the marking primes in an array, and using a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_factorization" rel="nofollow"&gt;wheel&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the search space by a factor of five, then marking a bit array in increments of the wheel using each marking prime. It also reduces storage to O(sqrt(N)) instead of O(N), which helps both in terms of the largest N, paging, and bandwidth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For medium values of N (1e8 to 1e12), the primes up to sqrt(N) can be found quite quickly, and after that you should be able to parallelise the subsequent search on the CPU quite easily. On my single core machine, the wheel approach finds primes up to 1e9 in 28s, whereas your sieve (after moving the sqrt out of the loop) takes 86s - the improvement is due to the wheel; the inversion means you can handle N larger than 2^32 but makes it slower.  Code can be found &lt;a href="http://www.tincancamera.com/examples/java/primes/" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You could parallelise the output of the results from the naive sieve after you go past sqrt(N) too, as the bit array is not modified after that point; but once you are dealing with N large enough for it to matter the array size is too big for ints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that point of view a project is not a failure while the client is willing to pay for it. It all depends on the client, some clients have more patience and understand better the risks of software development, other just won't pay if there's a substantial delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, about your question. Whenever you evolve a project there are risks involved, maybe you schedule the end of the project in a certain date but it will take like six month longer than you expected. In that case you have to balance what you have already spent and what you have to gain against the risks you're taking. There's actually an entire science called "decision making" that studies it at software level, so your boss is not wrong at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's look at some questions, Is the client willing to wait for the project? Is he willing to assume certain overcosts? Even if he doesn't, Is worth completing the project assuming the extra costs instead of throwing away all the already done work? Can the company assume what's already lost?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real answer to your problem lies behind that questions. You can't establish a point and say, here, if the project isn't done by this time then it's a failure. As for your specific situation, who knows? Your boss has probably more information that you have so your work is to tell him how is the project going, how much it will take and how much it will cost (in terms hours/man if you wish)&lt;/p&gt;

Two well-known modes of failures are schedule slip and quality deterioration, but in real-world, people do not seem to care much about them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple ways to slip the schedule are to let the managers make request whenever they want (features creep) and let the programmers code whatever they feel is right (cowboy coding). Change management process such as &lt;a href="http://www.agilecollab.com/sprint-planning-meeting" rel="nofollow"&gt;sprint planning&lt;/a&gt; of scrum and &lt;a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/planninggame.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;planning game&lt;/a&gt; of XP are some of the examples. Theses are some of the attempts for the management and the developers to ship reliable products on time. If either party is not interested in reliable or on-time, then change management would not be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've tried various combos under Xcode without any luck. (inline assembler works fine so it's not a syntax issue).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reference this is for an assert macro. I don't want to use the definitions in assert.h both for portability, and because they appear to do an abort() in the version XCode provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John - Super, cheers. For reference the int 3 syntax is the one required for Intel Macs and iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris - Thanks for your comment but there are many reasons to avoid the standard assert() function for codebases ported to different platforms. If you've gone to the trouble of rolling your own assert it's usually because you have additional functionality (logging, stack unwinding, user-interaction) that you wish to retain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your suggestion of attempting to replace the hander via an implementation of '__assert" or similar is not going to be portable. The standard 'assert' is usually a macro and while it may map to __assert on the Mac it doesn't on other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example you propose is perfectly solved in code, as you have shown so, what do you need a preprocessor directive to? You don't want to "preprocess" your code, you want the compiler to insert some code for you in your properties. It's common code but that's not the purpose of the preprocessor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With your example, Where do you put the limit? Clearly that satisfies an observer pattern and there's no doubt that will be useful but there are a lot of things that would be useful that are actually done because code provides &lt;strong&gt;flexibility&lt;/strong&gt; where as the preprocessor does not. If you try to implement common patterns through preprocessor directives you'll end with a preprocessor which needs to be as powerful as the language itself. If you want to &lt;strong&gt;process your code in a different way the use a preprocessor directive&lt;/strong&gt; but if you just want a code snippet then find another way because the preprocessor wasn't meant to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

But, these being quite different, they really screw up the layout of my forms. So... is there a good way to deal with this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example: I have a &lt;code&gt;Label&lt;/code&gt;, with some blank space in the middle, into which I place a &lt;code&gt;NumericUpDown&lt;/code&gt; control. If I use Segoe UI, the &lt;code&gt;NumericUpDown&lt;/code&gt; is about 5 pixels or so to the left of the blank space, compared to when I use Tahoma. This is a pain; I'm not sure what to do here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So most specifically, my question would be: how can I place controls in the middle of a blank space in my &lt;code&gt;Label&lt;/code&gt;s (or &lt;code&gt;CheckBox&lt;/code&gt;es, etc.)? Most generally: is there a good way to handle varying fonts in Windows Forms?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: I don't think people understood the question. I know how to &lt;em&gt;vary my fonts&lt;/em&gt; based on OS. I just don't know how to &lt;em&gt;deal with the layout problems&lt;/em&gt; that arise from doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with splitting the control is most apparent with, say, a &lt;code&gt;CheckBox&lt;/code&gt;. There, if the user clicks on the "second half" of the CheckBox (which would be a separate &lt;code&gt;Label&lt;/code&gt; control, I guess), the &lt;code&gt;CheckBox&lt;/code&gt; doesn't change state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting. I don't really consider a preprocessor to necessarily work this way.

That had me banging my head of a brick wall for a while. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its not really a great approach and the alternative is not really well documented. You need to create a use model instead. I have included an example below of a tree model that I created for displaying the structure of an LDAP directory.&lt;/p&gt;

dojo.declare("LDAPDirectoryTreeModel", [ dijit.tree.model ], {

    getLabel : function(item) {

&lt;p&gt;Since expressions cannot contain assignment statements, a modified expression like "&lt;code&gt;( x, h ) =&amp;gt; x.MyEvent += h&lt;/code&gt;" cannot be used to retrieve the event, so reflection would need to be used instead. A correct implementation would need to use reflection to retrieve the &lt;code&gt;EventInfo&lt;/code&gt; for the event (which, unfortunatley, will not be strongly typed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, the only updates that need to be made are to store the reflected &lt;code&gt;EventInfo&lt;/code&gt;, and use the &lt;code&gt;AddEventHandler&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;RemoveEventHandler&lt;/code&gt; methods to register the listener (instead of the manual &lt;code&gt;Delegate&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;Combine&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;Remove&lt;/code&gt; calls and field sets). The rest of the implementation should not need to be changed. Good luck :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

At any point while editing the data in the form the user can click one of the buttons on the form to perform certain actions.  By default the focus goes to the clicked button so the user has to click back on to the control they want to edit in order to continue modifying the data on the form.  What I need to be able to do is return the focus to the last edited control after the button click event has been processed.  Here's a sample screenshot that illustrates what I'm talking about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user can be entering data in textbox1, textbox2, textbox3, etc and click the button.  I need the button to return the focus back to the control that most recently had the focus before the button was clicked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering if anyone has a better way of implementing this functionality than what I've come up with.  Here's what I'm doing right now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;   public partial class Form1 : Form

        {
            _lastEnteredControl = (Control)sender;
        }

        private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)

            _lastEnteredControl.Focus();
        }


    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically what we have here is a class variable that points to the last entered control.  Each textbox on the form is setup so the textBox_Enter method is fired when the control receives the focus.  Then, when the button is clicked focus is returned to the control that had the focus before the button was clicked.  Anybody have any more elegant solutions for this?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Virtual functions in constructors, why do languages differ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because there's no one good behaviour.  I find the C++ behaviour makes more sense (since base class c-tors are called first, it stands to reason that they should call base class virtual functions--after all, the derived class c-tor hasn't run yet, so it may not have set up the right preconditions for the derived class virtual function).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sometimes, where I want to use the virtual functions to initialize state (so it doesn't matter that they're being called with the state uninitialized) the C#/Java behaviour is nicer.&lt;/p&gt;

The user can open unlimited number of files, and the program keeps the opened objects in the memory.

&lt;p&gt;I could increase the &lt;strong&gt;max heap size&lt;/strong&gt; using &lt;strong&gt;command line&lt;/strong&gt; option to java, but that would require figuring out available RAM and writing some launching program or script. Besides, increasing to some finite max does not ultimately get rid of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could rewrite some of my code to persist objects to file system frequently (using database is the same thing) to free up the memory. It could work, but it's probably a lot work too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you could point me to details of above ideas or some alternatives like &lt;strong&gt;automatic virtual memory, extending heap size dynamically&lt;/strong&gt;, that will be great.&lt;/p&gt;

In Windows 32 bit this is around 2gb (not specifically heap but total amount of memory per process). It just happens that Java happens to make the default smaller (presumably so that the programmer can't create programs that have runaway memory allocation without running into this problem and having to examine exactly what they are doing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this given there are several approaches you could take to either determine what amount of memory you need or to reduce the amount of memory you are using. One common mistake with garbage collected languages such as Java or C# is to keep around references to objects that you no longer are using, or allocating many objects when you could reuse them instead. As long as objects have a reference to them they will continue to use heap space as the garbage collector will not delete them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case you can use a Java memory profiler to determine what methods in your program are allocating large number of objects and then determine if there is a way to make sure they are no longer referenced, or to not allocate them in the first place. One option which I have used in the past is "JMP" &lt;a href="http://www.khelekore.org/jmp/"&gt;http://www.khelekore.org/jmp/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you determine that you are allocating these objects for a reason and you need to keep around references (depending on what you are doing this might be the case), you will just need to increase the max heap size when you start the program. However, once you do the memory profiling and understand how your objects are getting allocated you should have a better idea about how much memory you need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general if you can't guarantee that your program will run in some finite amount of memory (perhaps depending on input size) you will always run into this problem. Only after exhausting all of this will you need to look into caching objects out to disk etc. At this point you should have a very good reason to say "I need Xgb of memory" for something and you can't work around it by improving your algorithms or memory allocation patterns. Generally this will only usually be the case for algorithms operating on large datasets (like a database or some scientific analysis program) and then techniques like caching and memory mapped IO become useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

Replacing it with: &lt;code&gt;imagesx($targetImage) - 1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;imagesy($targetImage) - 1&lt;/code&gt;, relativily should do :)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem wasn't with databinding to a DataGridView in general, or with the implementation of a DataGridViewComboBoxColumn - as the people who have answered already rightly say, that is well documented on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem I've been trying to solve is with the refresh of properties that are drilling down through relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my orders example, when I change the value of the "Product" column, the "Product Type" column is not being updated - even though in the code I am setting the property and firing the NotifyPropertyChanged event. (In debug I go to all the right places)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a lot of poking around I realised that this was not even working when I directly set the "Product Type" property of datasource, rather that setting it in the "Product" setter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing that I believe has me back on the right track is that when I provide a mocked dataccess layer, created in the main form, everything works fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, when I copy the IList made by nHibernate to a IBindingList - everything again appears fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So&lt;/strong&gt; the problem is I think with threading and the NotifyPropertyChanged events being lost when using certain datasources, in certain ways (wish I could be more definitive than that!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm going to keep researching better ways of resolving this than copying the IList to the IBindingList - maybe I need to learn about thread marshalling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've now developed a solution that solves the issue and think I understand what was confusing me - basically it appears that anything but basic property databinding doesn't play nicely for lists that aren't derived from BindingList - as soon as I was trying to databind to properties that fired chained NotifyPropertyChanged events, things went haywire and I my events got lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data access solution I have now is using a variation of the Rob Conery &lt;a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/blog/crazy-talk-reducing-orm-friction/" rel="nofollow"&gt;IRepository&lt;/a&gt; pattern, returning my collections to be bound as a custom class I made, a SortableBindingLazyList that derives from BindingList, implements the Sort Core methods and also stores its internal list as a query, delaying the list materialisation.&lt;/p&gt;

My only worry in taking this approach is the scale setting of the bcmath extension, because there can't be any rounding errors in my 128-bit integers; they must be precise. I'm also worried about being able to eventually convert the result of the bcmath functions into a binary string (which I'll later need to shove into some mcrypt encryption functions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach #3:&lt;/strong&gt; Store the numbers as binary strings (probably LSB first). Theoretically I should be able to store integers of any arbitrary size this way. All I would have to do is write the four basic arithmetic functions to perform add/sub/mult/div on two binary strings and produce a binary string result. This is exactly the format I need to hand over to mcrypt as well, so that's an added plus. This is the approach I think has the most promise at the moment, but the one sticking point I've got is that PHP doesn't offer me any way to manipulate the individual bits (that I know of). I believe I'd have to break it up into byte-sized chunks (no pun intended), at which point my questions about handling overflow/underflow from Approach #1 apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd recommend basing your system on &lt;a href="http://www.debian.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt; - the &lt;a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Apt" rel="nofollow"&gt;apt&lt;/a&gt; system has become the de-facto way to quickly install and update programs on Linux. &lt;a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; is Debian based with an emphasis on usability and compatibility. As for windowing managers, in my opinion &lt;a href="http://www.xfce.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Xfce&lt;/a&gt; hits the right balance between being lightweight and functional. The Ubuntu-based &lt;a href="http://www.xubuntu.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Xubuntu&lt;/a&gt; would probably be a good match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember - for security only install essential network services like SSH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it were my decision, I would set up a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment" rel="nofollow"&gt;PXE boot server&lt;/a&gt; to easily install Ubuntu Server Edition to any computer on the network. The reason why I would choose Ubuntu is because it's the one I've had the most experience with and the one I can easily find help for. If I needed a windowing manager for the particular installation, I would also install either Xfce or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbox" rel="nofollow"&gt;Blackbox&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, I have an old laptop in my basement that I've set up in exactly this way and it's worked out quite well for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seconded. The whole idea that "enterprise development" is somehow distinct from (and usually the implication is 'more important than') normal development really irks me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there really is a benefit for using some technology, then you'll need to come up with a considered list of all the pros and cons that would occur if you switched.&lt;br /&gt;
Present this list to your co workers along with explanations and examples for each one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to be realistic when creating this list. You can't just say "Saves us lots of time!!! WIN!!" without addressing the fact that sometimes it is going to take MORE time, will require X months to come up to speed on the new tech, etc.  You have to show concrete examples where it will save time, and exactly how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise you can't just skirt over the cons as if they don't matter, your co-workers &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; call you on it.&lt;br /&gt;
If you don't do these things, or come across as just pushing what you personally like, nobody is going to take you seriously, and you'll just get a reputation for being the guy who's full of enthusiasm and energy but has no idea about anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW. Look out for this particular con. It will trump everything, unless you have a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of strong cases for all your other stuff:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The simple fact of the matter is&lt;/strong&gt;, if some other developer comes along a year later and decides they need access to your private member variable, they are simply going to edit the code, change it to protected, and carry on with their business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only real exceptions to this are if you're in the business of shipping binary dll's in black-box form to third parties.

&lt;p&gt;The use of a Unix-domain socket means that the Erlang daemon could be launched on-demand by &lt;code&gt;launchd&lt;/code&gt; and the Cocoa front-end could find the path to the socket to use via an environment variable.  That makes the rendezvous between the app and the daemon trivial, and it also makes it straightforward to develop multiple front-ends (or possibly a framework that wraps communication with the daemon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mac OS X &lt;code&gt;launchd&lt;/code&gt; system is really cool this way.  If you specify that a job should be launched on-demand via a secure Unix-domain socket, &lt;code&gt;launchd&lt;/code&gt; will actually create the socket itself with appropriate permissions, and advertise its location via the environment variable named in the job's property list.  The job, when started, will actually be passed a file descriptor to the socket by &lt;code&gt;launchd&lt;/code&gt; when it does a simple check-in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately this means that the entire process of the front-end opening the socket to communicate with the daemon, &lt;code&gt;launchd&lt;/code&gt; launching the daemon, and the daemon responding to the communication can be secure, even if the front-end and the daemon run at different privilege levels.&lt;/p&gt;

Sometimes DataSets or DataTables are more suited, like if it really is pretty light business logic, flat hierarchy of entities/records, or featuring some versioning capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Custom object collections shine when you want to implement a &lt;em&gt;deep hierarchy/graph&lt;/em&gt; of objects that cannot be efficiently represented in flat 2D tables. What you can demonstrate is a large graph of objects and getting certain events to propagate down the correct branches without invoking inappropriate objects in other branches. That way it is not necessary to loop or Select through each and every DataTable just to get the child records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in a project I got involved in two and half years ago, there was a UI module that is supposed to display questions and answer controls in a single WinForms DataGrid (to be more specific, it was Infragistics' UltraGrid). Some more tricky requirements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The answer control for a question can be &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; - text box, check box options, radio button options, drop-down lists, or even to pop up a custom dialog box that may pull more data from a web service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depending on what the user answered, it can trigger more sub-questions to appear directly under the parent question. If a different answer is given later, it should expose another set of sub-questions (if any) related to that answer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original implementation was written entirely in DataSets, DataTables, and arrays. The amount of looping through the hundreds of rows for multiple tables was purely mind-bending. It did not help the programmer came from a C++ background attempting to &lt;em&gt;ref&lt;/em&gt; everything (hello, objects living in the heap use &lt;em&gt;reference variables&lt;/em&gt;, like pointers!). Nobody, not even the originally programmer, could explain why the code is doing what it does. I came into the scene more than six months after this, and it was stil flooded with bugs. No wonder the 2nd-generation developer I took over from decided to quit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two months of tying to fix the chaotic mess, I took it upon myself to redesign the entire module into an &lt;a href="http://icelava.net/forums/thread/1215.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;object-oriented graph to solve this problem&lt;/a&gt;. yeap, complete with abstract classes (to render different answer control on a grid cell depending on question type), delegates and eventing. The end result was a 2D dataGrid binded to a deep hierarchy of questions, naturally sorted according to the parent-child arrangement. When a parent question's answer changed, it would raise an event to the children questions and they would automatically show/hide their rows in the grid according to the parent's answer. Only question objects down that path were affected. The UI responsiveness of this solution compared to the old method was by orders of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;

You will need to write a custom assert function yourself, as C++'s &lt;code&gt;assert()&lt;/code&gt; is exactly C's &lt;code&gt;assert()&lt;/code&gt;, with the &lt;code&gt;abort()&lt;/code&gt; "feature" bundled in.  Fortunately, this is surprisingly straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assert.hh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;template &amp;lt;typename X, typename A&amp;gt;
inline void Assert(A assertion)
{
    if( !assertion ) throw X();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above function will throw an exception if a predicate doesn't hold.  You will then have the chance to catch the exception.  If you don't catch the exception, &lt;code&gt;terminate()&lt;/code&gt; will be called, which will end the program similarly to &lt;code&gt;abort()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may wonder what about optimizing away the assertion when we're building for production.  In this case, you can define constants that will signify that you're building for production and then refer to the constant when you &lt;code&gt;Assert()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;debug.hh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#ifdef NDEBUG
    const bool CHECK_WRONG = false;
#else
    const bool CHECK_WRONG = true;
#endif
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;main.cc&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#include&amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;

struct Wrong { };

int main()
{
    try {
        Assert&amp;lt;Wrong&amp;gt;(!CHECK_WRONG || 2 + 2 == 5);
        std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; "I can go to sleep now.\n";
    }
    catch( Wrong e ) {
        std::cerr &amp;lt;&amp;lt; "Someone is wrong on the internet!\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;CHECK_WRONG&lt;/code&gt; is a constant then the call to &lt;code&gt;Assert()&lt;/code&gt; will be compiled away in production, even if the assertion is not a constant expression.  There is a slight disadvantage in that by referring to &lt;code&gt;CHECK_WRONG&lt;/code&gt; we type a little more.  But in exchange we gain an advantage in that we can classify various groups of assertions and enable and disable each of them as we see fit.  So, for example we could define a group of assertions that we want enabled even in production code, and then define a group of assertions that we only want to see in development builds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Assert()&lt;/code&gt; function is equivalent to typing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if( !assertion ) throw X();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but it clearly indicates the intent of the programmer:  make an assertion.  Assertions are also easier to grep for with this approach, just like plain &lt;code&gt;assert()&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the haystack needs pre-processing, like say in a trie, the &lt;code&gt;haystack.find(needle)&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;words.hasAWordWithPrefix(prefix)&lt;/code&gt;) works better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both the above cases, one of needle or haystack is aware of the search. Also, they both are aware of each other. If you want the needle and haystack not to be aware of each other or of the search, &lt;code&gt;searcher.find(needle, haystack)&lt;/code&gt; would be appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a standard iPhone you'll need to pay the US$99/yr to be a member of the developer program. You can then use the adhoc system to install your application onto up to 100 devices. The developer program has the details but it involves adding UUIDs for each of the devices to your application package. UUIDs can be easiest retrieved using &lt;a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=285691333&amp;amp;mt=8"&gt;Ad Hoc Helper&lt;/a&gt; available from the App Store. For further details on this method, see Craig Hockenberry's &lt;a href="http://furbo.org/2008/08/06/beta-testing-on-iphone-20/"&gt;Beta testing on iPhone 2.0&lt;/a&gt; article&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jailbroken iPhone&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For jailbroken iPhones, you can use the following method which I have personally tested using the &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/samplecode/AccelerometerGraph/index.html"&gt;AccelerometerGraph&lt;/a&gt; sample app on iPhone OS 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create Self-Signed Certificate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First you'll need to create a self signed certificate and patch your iPhone SDK to allow the use of this certificate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launch Keychain Access.app. With no items selected, from the Keychain menu select Certificate Assistant, then Create a Certificate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Name: iPhone Developer&lt;br&gt;
Certificate Type: Code Signing&lt;br&gt;
Let me override defaults: Yes  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click Continue&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Validity: 3650 days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click Continue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blank out the Email address field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click Continue until complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should see "This root certificate is not trusted". This is expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set the iPhone SDK to allow the self-signed certificate to be used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;sudo /usr/bin/sed -i .bak 's/XCiPhoneOSCodeSignContext/XCCodeSignContext/' /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Info.plist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have Xcode open, restart it for this change to take effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Manual Deployment over WiFi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following steps require &lt;code&gt;openssh&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;uikittools&lt;/code&gt; to be installed first. Replace &lt;code&gt;jasoniphone.local&lt;/code&gt; with the hostname of the target device.  Be sure to set your own password on both the &lt;code&gt;mobile&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; users after installing SSH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To manually compile and install your application on the phone as a system app (bypassing Apple's installation system):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project, Set Active SDK, Device and Set Active Build Configuration, Release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compile your project normally (using Build, not Build &amp;amp; Go).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;build/Release-iphoneos&lt;/code&gt; directory you will have an app bundle. Use your preferred method to transfer this to /Applications on the device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;scp -r AccelerometerGraph.app root@jasoniphone:/Applications/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let SpringBoard know the new application has been installed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh mobile@jasoniphone.local uicache&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This only has to be done when you add or remove applications. Updated applications just need to be relaunched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

The XOR method is only O(n) if you assume that bitwise XOR of two strings is a constant time operation. This is equivalent to saying that the size of the integers in the array is bounded by a constant. In that case you can use Radix sort to sort the array in O(n).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No write permission (get permission through Security tab on file Properties window; you must be the file owner or an Administrator)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File is locked (close any program that may have the file open, then reboot if that doesn't help)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File has the read-only DOS attribute set (unset it from file Properties window, or with &lt;code&gt;attrib -r&lt;/code&gt;; you must be the file owner or an Administrator)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 1: Only the second item (file is locked) has a possible solution that all users are likely to be able to do without help.  For the first and third, you'll probably want to provide guidance (and hope the file wasn't made read-only intentionally!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: Technically, the user does need write and execute (chdir) permissions on all directories up to the root.  Windows may skip some of the recursive checks up the tree as a performance optimization, but you should not rely on this because admins can force on these so-called "traverse checks" for certain users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 3: @&lt;a href="#37712" rel="nofollow"&gt;RobM&lt;/a&gt;: Yes, you should check that there is no obvious reason that the user should not have the permissions she needs but does not have.  I alluded to this in a less direct way in my first edit.  However, in some cases users should have write permission to a file but do not because of filesystem corruption, a misbehaving program, or a mistake on their own part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not defending either side here but... One reason that a employer may want such a clause is that, as with most creative jobs, "working hours" is a not really definable. Your mind (or mine at a minimum) works on problems at work, at home, while asleep and wherever. If you are on salary, it might be reasonable to claim that they are paying you for all this time so they might be able to claim that whatever you produce in that time should be theres. This gets a bit silly if they want to claim IP not related to your vocation but with regard to FOSS work by a programmer it is understandable. As for acceptable, moral, legal, reasonable and whatnot... that is a different question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int a[17];
n = sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0]);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To determine the size of your array in bytes, you can use the &lt;code&gt;sizeof&lt;/code&gt;
operator:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int a[17];
int n = sizeof(a);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my computer, ints are 4 bytes long, so n is 68.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To determine the number of elements in the array, we can divide
the total size of the array by the size of the array element.
You could do this with the type, like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int a[17];
int n = sizeof(a) / sizeof(int);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and get the proper answer (68 / 4 = 17), but if the type of
&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; changed you would have a nasty bug if you forgot to change
the &lt;code&gt;sizeof(int)&lt;/code&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the preferred divisor is &lt;code&gt;sizeof(a[0])&lt;/code&gt;, the size of the
zeroeth element of the array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int a[17];
int n = sizeof(a) / sizeof(a[0]);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another advantage is that you can now easily parameterize
the array name in a macro and get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#define NELEMS(x)  (sizeof(x) / sizeof(x[0]))

int a[17];
int n = NELEMS(a);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

In C++11, however, the &lt;code&gt;std::fstream&lt;/code&gt; class does allow passing a &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt; for its constructor parameter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you may wonder why isn't there a transparent conversion from a &lt;code&gt;std:string&lt;/code&gt; to a C string, so a class that expects a C string could still take a &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt; just like a class that expects a &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt; can take a C string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is that this would cause a conversion cycle, which in turn may lead to problems.  For example, suppose &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt; would be convertible to a C string so that you could use &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt;s with &lt;code&gt;fstream&lt;/code&gt;s.  Suppose also that C string are convertible to &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt;s as is the state in the current standard.  Now, consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void f(std::string str1, std::string str2);
void f(char* cstr1, char* cstr2);

void g()
{
    char* cstr = "abc";
    std::string str = "def";
    f(cstr, str);  // ERROR:  ambiguous
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you can convert either way between a &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt; and a C string the call to &lt;code&gt;f()&lt;/code&gt; could resolve to either of the two &lt;code&gt;f()&lt;/code&gt; alternatives, and is thus ambiguous.  The solution is to break the conversion cycle by making one conversion direction explicit, which is what the STL chose to do with &lt;code&gt;c_str()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not really. A stack overflow happens when you exhaust the stack space - however...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The initial stack size can be changed programatically and may default to different amounts depending on your OS/compiler/etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much of it is already used up depends on what your app (and the libraries your app uses) has previously done - this is often impossible to predict&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much of the stack each call requires depends on what you do in your function. If you only allocate say 1 integer on the stack, you may be able to recurse an enourmous amount of times, but if you are allocating a 200k buffer on the stack, not so much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only times I've ever hit one is in an infinite loop, or using the aforementioned 200k buffer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it far more prefereable for my app to just crash, than for it to loop forever using 100% CPU and have to be forcefully killed (this is a right PITA on a remote server over a bad connection as windows lacks SSH)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rough guideline: Do you think your recursive function is likely to call itself more than say 10,000 times consecutively? Or are you doing something dumb like allocating 200k buffers on the stack?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If yes, worry about it.&lt;br /&gt;
If no, carry on with more important things.&lt;/p&gt;

The first and foremost reason is that it is completely unobtrusive. My application code has no dependencies on the framework, it is highly decoupled, reusable and testable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the nicest features of Mate is the declarative configuration, essentially you wire up your application in using tags in what is called an event map -- basically a list of events that your application generates, and what actions to take when they occur. The event map gives a good overview of what your application does. Mate uses Flex' own event mechanism, it does not invent its own like most other frameworks. You can dispatch an event from anywhere in the view hierarchy and have it bubble up to the framework automatically, instead of having to have a direct line, like Cairngorms CairngormEventDispatcher or PureMVC's notification system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mate also uses a form of dependency injection (leveraging bindings) that makes it possible to connect your models to your views without either one knowing about the other. This is probably the most powerful feature of the framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my view none of the other Flex application frameworks come anywhere near Mate. However, these are the contenders and why I consider them to be less useful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PureMVC actively denies you many of the benefits of Flex (for example bindings and event bubbling) in order for the framework to be portable -- a doubious goal in my view. It is also over-engineered, and as invasive as they come. Every single part of your application depends on the framework. However, PureMVC isn't terrible, just not a very good fit for Flex. An alternative is &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/flexmvcs/"&gt;FlexMVCS&lt;/a&gt;, an effort to make PureMVC more suitable for Flex (unfortunately there's no documentation yet, just source). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cairngorm is a bundle of anti-patterns that lead to applications that are tightly coupled to global variables. Nuff said (but if you're interested, &lt;a href="http://blog.iconara.net/2008/04/13/architectural-atrocities-part-x-cairngorms-model-locator-pattern/"&gt;here are some more of my  thoughts&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://blog.iconara.net/2008/12/13/architectural-atrocities-part-10-cairngorms-service-locator/"&gt;here too&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/swizframework"&gt;Swiz&lt;/a&gt; is a framework inspired by the Spring framework for Java and Cairngorm (trying to make up for the worst parts of the latter). It provides a dependency injection container and uses metadata to enable auto-wiring of dependencies. It is interesting, but a little bizzare in that goes to such lengths to avoid the global variables of Cairngorm by using dependency injection but then uses a global variable for central event dispatching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are the ones I've tried or researched. There are a few others that I've heard about, but none that I think are widely used. Mate and Swiz were both presented at the recent 360|Flex conference, and there are videos available (&lt;a href="http://mate.asfusion.com/news/360-flex-presentation"&gt;the Mate folks have instructions on how to watch them&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to make the exception processing as generic as possible, and therefore to allow us to use it for any BizTalk application, our XML error schema includes an xs:any node, into which we can place a variety of data, depending on the actual exception.  The generated XML should then be presented to a user through an InfoPath 2003 form for manual intervention before being represented back to BizTalk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that InfoPath 2003 doesn't like schemas with an xs:any node.  What we'd really like to do is the show the content of the exception report in a form with all relevant parameters mapped , and the entire content of the xs:any node in a text box, since users who are able to see these messages will be conversant with XML.  Unfortunately, I am unable to make InfoPath even load the schema at design time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any recommendation for how to achieve what we need, please?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not being too familiar with your db schema or data entry form, I'd suggest a route something like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;have distinct fields in your db for each address "part", e.g. street, city, postal code, Lnder, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;have your data entry form broken down similarly, e.g. street, city, etc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasoning behind the above is that each part will likely have it's own particular "rules" for checking slightly-changed addressed, ("Quellenstrasse"-&gt;"Quellenstr.", "66/11"-&gt;"66a-11" above) so your validation code can check if the values as presented for each field exist in their respective db field. If not, you can have a class that applies the transformation rules for each given field (e.g. "strasse" stemmed to "str") and checks again for duplicates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously the above method has it's drawbacks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;it can be slow, depending on your data set, leaving the user waiting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;users may try to get around it by putting address "Parts" in the wrong fields (appending post code to city, etc). 
but from experience we've found that introducing even simple checking like the above will prevent a large percentage of users from entering pre-existing addresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you've the basic checking in place, you can look at optimising the db accesses required, refining the rules, etc to meet your particular schema. You might also take a look at &lt;a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/fulltext-search.html#function_match" rel="nofollow"&gt;MySQL's match() function&lt;/a&gt; for working out similar text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is fine if:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the order of magnitude of your inputs don't change much&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;very small numbers of opposite signs can be treated as equal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But otherwise it'll lead you into trouble.  Double precision numbers have a resolution of about 16 decimal places.  If the two numbers you are comparing are larger in magnitude than EPSILON*1.0E16, then you might as well be saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;return a==b;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll examine a different approach that assumes you need to worry about the first issue and assume the second is fine your application.  A solution would be something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#define VERYSMALL  (1.0E-150)
#define EPSILON    (1.0E-8)
bool AreSame(double a, double b)
{
    double absDiff = fabs(a - b);
    if (absDiff &amp;lt; VERYSMALL)
    {
        return true;
    }

    double maxAbs  = max(fabs(a) - fabs(b));
    return (absDiff/maxAbs) &amp;lt; EPSILON;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is expensive computationally, but it is sometimes what is called for.  This is what we have to do at my company because we deal with an engineering library and inputs can vary by a few dozen orders of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the point is this (and applies to practically every programming problem): Evaluate what your needs are, then come up with a solution to address your needs -- don't assume the easy answer will address your needs.  If after your evaluation you find that &lt;code&gt;fabs(a-b) &amp;lt; EPSILON&lt;/code&gt; will suffice, perfect -- use it!  But be aware of its shortcomings and other possible solutions too.&lt;/p&gt;

we have distributed system, 60 boxes running each 10 clients all do task X, and they need to take the next task from a "Q". The Q is being fed from one other "client"...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had used inter process communication, we used MSMQ, we tried service broker... It just doesn't work in the long term because you are giving away the control of your application to Microsoft. It works great as long as your needs are satisfied. it becomes hell when you need something not supported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best solution for us was: Use a SQL Database table as the "Q". Don't reinvent the wheel there, since you will make mistakes (locks). There is info out there on how to do it, it is very easy and we handled over 200K messages per 24H (with 60x10 = 600 concurrent reads and writes to the Q). That is in addition to the same SQL server handling the rest of the application stuff...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some reasons why MSMQ doesn't work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you need to change the logic of the Q to not FIFO, but something like "the oldest RED message" or "the oldest BLUE message" you can;t do it. (I know what people will say, you can do it by having a RED Q and a BLUE Q.. .But what if the number/types of Ques is dynamic based on the way the application is administrated and changes daily?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It adds a point of failure and deployment nightmare (the Q is a point of failure and you need to deal with setting the right permissions on all boxes to read/write messages etc' in Enterprise software you pay in blood for these type of things). SQL server... all clients are writing/reading already from the DB, it is just one more table..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import cgi

&lt;p&gt;For example, say you have an object of an unknown type in Java, and you would like to call a 'doSomething' method on it if one exists. Java's static typing system isn't really designed to support this unless the object conforms to a known interface, but using reflection, your code can look at the object and find out if it has a method called 'doSomething' and then call it if you want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to give you a code example of this in Java (imagine the object in question is foo) :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Method method = foo.getClass().getMethod("doSomething", null);
method.invoke(foo, null);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One very common use case in Java is the usage with annotations. JUnit 4, for example, will use reflection to look through your classes for methods tagged with the @Test annotation, and will then call them when running the unit test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some good reflection examples to get you started at &lt;a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/index.html"&gt;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, yes, the concepts are pretty much similar in other statically types languages which support reflection (like C#). In dynamically typed languages, the use case described above is less necessary (since the compiler will allow any method to be called on any object, failing at runtime if it does not exist), but the second case of looking for methods which are marked or work in a certain way is still common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflection is the ability to "reflect" on the structure of your program. Or more concrete. To look at the objects and classes you have and programmatically get back information on the methods, fields, and interfaces they implement. You can also look at things like annotations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's usefull in a lot of situations. Everywhere you want to be able to dynamically plug in classes into your code. Lot's of object relational mappers use reflection to be able to instantiate objects from databases without knowing in advance what objects they're going to use. Plug-in architectures is another place where reflection is usefull. Being able to dynamically load code and determine if there are types there that implement the right interface to use as a plugin is important in those situations.&lt;/p&gt;

The project I'm currently on required a lot of argument to get the older programmers to use XML/schemas/data sets instead of just CSV files (the previous version of the software used CSV's). It's not perfect, the schemas aren't robust enough at validating the data. But it's a step in the right direction. The code I develop uses OO abstractions on the data sets rather than passing data set objects around. Generally, it's best to teach by example, one small step at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, all objects in Java has the method &lt;b&gt;getClass&lt;/b&gt;, which lets you determine its class even if you don't know it at compile time (like if you declared it as &lt;b&gt;Object&lt;/b&gt;) - this might seem trivial, but such reflection is not by default possible in less dynamic languages such as C++.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More advanced uses lets you list and call methods, constructors, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflection is important since it lets you write programs that does not have to "know" everything at compile time, making them more dynamic, since they can be tied together at runtime. The code can be written against known interfaces, but the actual classes to be used can be instantiated using reflection from configuration files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of modern frameworks uses reflection extensively for this very reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most other modern languages uses reflection as well, and in script languages like Python can be said to be even more tightly integrated, since it matches more naturally with the general programming model for those languages.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;@PConroy: This was my initial thougt also. the interesting part on this is to find good transformation rules for the different parts of the address! Any good suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we were working on this type of project before, our approach was to take our existing corpus of addresses (150k or so), then apply the most common transformations for our domain (Ireland, so "Dr"-&gt;"Drive", "Rd"-&gt;"Road", etc). I'm afraid there was no comprehensive online resource for such things at the time, so we ended up basically coming up with a list ourselves, checking things like the phone book (pressed for space there, addresses are abbreviated in all manner of ways!). As I mentioned earlier, you'd be amazed how many "duplicates" you'll detect with the addition of only a few common rules!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've recently stumbled across a page with a fairly comprehensive &lt;a href="http://www.semaphorecorp.com/cgi/abbrev.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;list of address abbreviations&lt;/a&gt;, although it's american english, so I'm not sure how useful it'd be in Germany! A quick google turned up a couple of sites, but they seemed like spammy newsletter sign-up traps. Although that was me googling in english, so you may have more look with "german address abbreviations" in german :)&lt;/p&gt;

See the &lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/sql-update.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;PostgreSQL UPDATE docs&lt;/a&gt; (under Parameters, expression), where it mentions that expressions on the right hand side of SET clauses explicitly use the old values of columns. I see that the corresponding &lt;a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/6.0/en/update.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;MySQL UPDATE docs&lt;/a&gt; contain the statement "Single-table UPDATE assignments are generally evaluated from left to right" which implies the behaviour you describe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can very easily set up unit testing to run on every checkin as well, FXCop testing, and a slew of other products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also advise checking out &lt;a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/"&gt;Team City&lt;/a&gt; as an option, because it has a free version, and the reporting and setup is reportedly much simpler (it does look nice to me). It does have a limit of somewhere around 20 team members/projects, before it hits a pay-for window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, we started with CCNET, and have grown several products too large to look at Team City on the free version and are very happy with what we have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Features that help with CCNET include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XML based configuration - you can usually copy and paste most of what you need. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More or less you'll be able to plug your treesurgeon script in as your build script, and point CCNET at that as an executable task to run the compilation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of documentation and very easy to set up nunit, ncover, fxcop, etc. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taskbar app that will let you know the status of your projects at any time, and it can also fire off an email or keep an RSS feed with the same information. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I'd definitely go with running a CI build on every check-in - for the most part will run the unit tests before checking in, but let the CCNET server handle run any applications/assemblies that would have dependencies on the assembly we're checking in, and they get re-built, and re-tested on every checkin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that CCNET is free free and takes very little time to set up - I'd highly recommend just going for it and seeing if it suits you, then expanding from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(There's another thread here where I posted pretty much the same/with a few alterations - but some of the other comments may help too! &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36568/automated-builds#37204"&gt;Automated Builds&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit to add: You can easily set up your own deployment scheme for CCNET, and there are a tonne of blog posts out there to assist, and email notifications can really be set up fairly granularly, either on all successes, all failures, when it changes from success to fail, etc. There's also built in RSS, and you could even set up your own notifiers for other systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Using the NSTask class, your program can run another program as a subprocess and can monitor that programs execution. An NSTask object creates a separate executable entity; it differs from NSThread in that it does not share memory space with the process that creates it.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;A task operates within an environment defined by the current values for several items: the current directory, standard input, standard output, standard error, and the values of any environment variables. By default, an NSTask object inherits its environment from the process that launches it. If there are any values that should be different for the task, for example, if the current directory should change, you must change the value before you launch the task. A tasks environment cannot be changed while it is running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can communicate with the backend process by way of &lt;code&gt;stdin&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;stdout&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;stderr&lt;/code&gt;. Bascially &lt;code&gt;NSTask&lt;/code&gt; is a high-level wrapper around &lt;code&gt;exec&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;fork&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;system&lt;/code&gt;, I always forget the difference).&lt;/p&gt;

Anyone know how to retrieve the build path from Eclipse? (I'm working in CDT by the way). Also is there a simple way to determine what the source path is (e.g. one file is under the "src" directory) of a source file?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think you'll be able to get the path you require (the All Users path) in an OS dependent way.  After all - do other operating systems have an equivalent?  Your best bet is to probably inspect:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;System.getProperty("os.name");
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to see if you are running Windows and then if so use "C:\Documents &amp;amp; Settings\All Users\".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you'll be better off just constantly using&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;System.getProperty("user.home");
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(as mentioned by other people) throughout the application.  Or alternatively, allow the user to specify the directory to store whatever it is you want to store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The /dev/random driver gathers environmental noise from various non-deterministic sources including, but not limited to, inter-keyboard timings and inter-interrupt timings that occur within the operating system environment. The noise data is sampled and combined with a CRC-like mixing function into a continuously updating ``entropy-pool''. Random bit strings are obtained by taking a MD5 hash of the contents of this pool. The one-way hash function distills the true random bits from pool data and hides the state of the pool from adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The /dev/random routine maintains an estimate of true randomness in the pool and decreases it every time random strings are requested for use. When the estimate goes down to zero, the routine locks and waits for the occurrence of non-deterministic events to refresh the pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The /dev/random kernel module also provides another interface, /dev/urandom, that does not wait for the entropy-pool to re-charge and returns as many bytes as requested. As a result /dev/urandom is considerably faster at generation compared to /dev/random which is used only when very high quality randomness is desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, just use XOR if they're numbers. You mentioned coordinates, so do you have lovely integer values, or complex strings?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;update swapper set foo = foo ^ bar, bar = foo ^ bar, foo = foo ^ bar;

You have to build a query to show the list of users with the best "n" scores. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm making an example to clarify. Let's say that this is the Users table, with the points earned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;UserId - Points
1      - 100
2      -  75
3      -  50
4      -  50
5      -  50
6      -  25
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I want the top 3 scores, the result will be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;UserId - Points
1      - 100
2      -  75
3      -  50
4      -  50
5      -  50
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be realized in a view or a stored procedure, as you want. My target db is Sql Server. Actually I solved this, but I think there are different way to obtain the result... faster or more efficent than mine.&lt;/p&gt;

where points in (select distinct top N points from users order by points desc)

&lt;p&gt;If you want to put that in a stored proc which takes N as a parameter, then you'll either have to do read the SQL into a variable then execute it, or do the row count trick:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;declare @SQL nvarchar(2000)
set @SQL = "select userID, points from users "
set @SQL = @SQL + " where points in (select distinct top " + @N
set @SQL = @SQL + " points from users order by points desc)"

execute @SQL
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strike&gt;or &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT  UserID, Points
FROM     (SELECT  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY points DESC)

        AS usersWithPoints
WHERE  Row between 0 and @N

Furthermore, &lt;code&gt;wideHeaderBox&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt; will only have significance to someone who intimately knows the system.

&lt;p&gt;If you guys just &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to use HTML generation, you should use it interspersed in view files, and you should use it where it's really necessary/useful, such as something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;HTML::link("Wikipedia", "http://en.wikipedia.org");
HTML::bulleted_list(array(
    HTML::list_item("Dogs"),
    HTML::list_item("Cats"),

));

&lt;li&gt;It's a graphical programming language. It isn't text based (this might be
positive or negative). It does make it more intuitive and easy for kids (7 and
up).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's actually highly object. The objects you write these graphical scripts have the code attached to them and can be reused and moved around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Very Important&lt;/strong&gt;: quick and impressive results. Kids need to get going fast and get results in order to get hooked. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd like to note that although many of us started programing at a young age in basic or logo and because programmer later in life doesn't mean those are good languages to start with. I think that kids today have much better options, like scratch or Alice.
Text based languages (python, ruby, basic, c# or even c) are dependent on external libraries and tools (editors, compilers) while something like Alice or scratch is all inclusive and will teach kids (not aimed at teens) programming concepts. Later they can move on and expand their learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All 3 seem to have problems with C++ templates to varying degrees. CC-Rider simply crashed in the middle of the analysis and CodeDrawer does not show many of the relationships.

&lt;p&gt;Some basic ideas I try to keep in mind when marking up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regarding html:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try to write for the next person - that is, think about how easy or difficult it might be for someone else to come and pick up your work and carry on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support this principle, you should try and make sure your markup is as legible as possible - class and id tags in particular should relate &lt;em&gt;as much as possible&lt;/em&gt; to their intended content. In other words, try to use your tags to describe the kind of content they will have.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, "Sub-navigation", "content" etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim is to provide markup that someone can pickup having not looked at before and get a sense of the logical structure of the document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, try to avoid the addition of markup that is purely to achieve a visual effect. But bear in mind that any website that requires even slightly sophisticated styling is unlikely to be able avoid non-semantic markup, due to weaknesses in current implementations of CSS and browser-compatibility issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regarding CSS files:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people divide their css up into sections using comments, separating them into functional or structural areas. So you might have a section for your header, your footer, or typography and so on. Others take this further and split css across files, having one for typography, one for layout etc. However, this can according to Yslow! can have a negative impact on page loading, due to increased http requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could write more, but as you can see I struggle to be concise. I hope this is of some use to you.&lt;/p&gt;
