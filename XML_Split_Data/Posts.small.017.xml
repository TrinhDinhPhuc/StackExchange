&lt;p&gt;I have a bunch of different files on a bunch of different computers. It's mostly media and there is quite a bit of it. I'm looking into various ways of consolidating this into something more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently there are a few options I'm looking at, the &lt;strong&gt;most&lt;/strong&gt; insane of which is some kind of samba share indexer that would generate a list of things shared on the various samba servers I tell it about and upload them to a website which could then be searched and browsed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a cheap solution, OK?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignoring the fact that the idea is obviously a couple of methods short of a class, do you chaps know of any way to link to samba file shares in html in a cross-browser way? In windows one does \\computer\share, in linux one does smb://computer/share, neither of which work afaik from browsers that aren't also used as file managers (e.g. any browser that isn't Internet Explorer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Clarifications&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The computers used to access this website are a mixture of WIndows (XP) and Linux (Ubuntu) with a mixture of browsers (Opera and Firefox).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In linux entering smb://computer/share only seems to work in Nautilus (and presumably Konqueror / Dolphin for you KDE3.5/4 people). It doesn't work in Firefox or Opera (Firefox does nothing, Opera complains the URL is invalid).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don't have a Windows box handy atm so I'm unsure if \\computer\share works in anything apart from IE (e.g. Firefox / Opera).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have a better idea for consolidating a bunch of random samba shares (it certainly can't get much worse than mine ;-)) it's worth knowing that there is no guarantee that any of the servers I would be wanting to index / consolidate would be up at any particular moment. Moreover, I wouldn't want the knowledge of what they have shared lost or hidden just because they weren't available. I would want to know that they share 'foo' but they are currently down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One case that I can think of is when the data you are modelling cannot be easily represented in a relational database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once such example is the database used by mobile phone operators to monitor and control base stations for mobile telephone networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I almost all of these cases, an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_database" rel="nofollow"&gt;OO DB&lt;/a&gt; is used, either a commercial product or a self-rolled system that allows heirarchies of objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've worked on a 3G monitoring application for a large company who will remain nameless, but whose logo is a red wine stain (-:  , and they used such an OO DB to keep track of all the various attributes for individual cells within the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interrogation of such DBs is done using proprietary techniques that are, usually, completely free from SQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You set up a DFS root and tell it about all the other SMB/Samba shares you have in your environment.  Clients then connect to the root and see all the shares as if they were hosted on that single root machine; the root silently redirects clients to the correct system when they open a share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An memory leak is when you attach to an resource and do not let it go, that you can do both in managed and in unmanaged coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding .net, and other programming tools, there have been ideas about garbage collecting, and other ways of minimizing situations that will make your application leak.
But the best method of preventing memory leaks is that you need to understand your underlying memory model, and how things works, on the platform you are using.
Believing that GC and other magic will clean up your mess is the short way to memory leaks, and will be difficult to find later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When coding unmanaged, you normally make sure to clean up, you know that the resources you take hold of, will be your responsibility to clean up, not the janitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In .net on the other hand, lot of people think that GC will clean up everything. Well, it does some for you, but you need to make sure that it is so. .net do wrap lots of things, so you do not always know if you are dealing with an managed or unmanaged resource, and you need to make sure what you do. Handling fonts, gdi resources, active directory, databases etc is typically things you need to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In managed terms I will put my neck on
  the line to say it does go away once
  the process is killed/removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see lots of people have this though, and I really hope this will end. You cannot ASK the user to terminate your app to clean up your mess!
Take a look at an browser, that can be IE, FF etc, then open, say, Google Reader, let it stay for some days, and look at what happes.
If you then open another tab in the browser, surf to some site, then close the tab that host the other page, that made the browser leak, do you think the browser will release the memory?, Not so with IE at least.. on my computer, IE easily will eat 1gig memory in short time (about 3-4 days) if I use Google Reader. Some newspages is even worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are philosophical debates about what randomness means.  Here, I will mean "indistinguishable in every respect from a uniform(0,1) iid distribution over the samples drawn"  I am totally ignoring philosophical questions of what random is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knuth volume 2 has an analysis where he attempts to create a random number generator as you suggest, and then analyzes why it fails, and what true random processes are.  Volume 2 examines RNGs in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The others recommend you using random physical processes to generate random numbers.  However, as we can see in the Espo/vt interaction, these processes can have subtle periodic elements and other non-random elements, in part due to outside factors with deterministic behavior.  In general, it is best never to assume randomness, but always to test for it, and you usually can correct for such artifacts if you are aware of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to create an "infinite" stream of bits that appears completely random, deterministically.  Unfortunately, such approaches grow in memory with the number of bits asked for (as they would have to, to avoid repeating cycles), so their scope is limited.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, you are almost always better off using a pseudo-random number generator with known properties.  The key numbers to look for is the phase-space dimension (which is roughly offset between samples you can still count on being uniformally distributed) and the bit-width (the number of bits in each sample which are uniformally random with respect to each other), and the cycle size (the number of samples you can take before the distribution starts repeating).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, since random numbers from a given generator are deterministically in a known sequence, your procedure might be exposed by someone searching through the generator and finding an aligning sequence.  Therefore, you can likely avoid your distribution being immediately recognized as coming from a particular random number generator if you maintain two generators.  From the first, you sample i, and then map this uniformally over one to n, where n is at most the phase dimension.  Then, in the second you sample i times, and return the ith result. This will reduce your cycle size to (orginal cycle size/n) in the worst case, but for that cycle will still generate uniform random numbers, and do so in a way that makes the search for alignment exponential in n.  It will also reduce the independent phase length.  Don't use this method unless you understand what reduced cycle and independent phase lengths mean to your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use XML files a lot - you get well structured data, nice tools for querying same the ability to do edits if appropriate, something that's human readable and you don't then have to worry about the db engine working (or the workings of the db engine). This works well for stuff that's essentially read only (in our case more often than not generated from a db elsewhere) and also for single user systems where you can just load the data in and save it out as required - but you're creating opportunities for problems if you want multi-user editing - at least of a single file. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All works as per MSDN using the default SettingsProvider (LocalFileSettingsProvider), but I do have concerns about where it gets stored and hopefully somebody can provide a solution. Essentially the file ends up in the local application data and in an unsavoury sub-directory structure. (AppData / Local / &lt;em&gt;company&lt;/em&gt; / *namespace_StrongName_gibberish* / &lt;em&gt;version&lt;/em&gt; ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to tell the LocalFileSettingsProvider to store the configuration file so the data will roam and perhaps in a less crazy folder structure? (or maybe an implementation of SettingsProvider that already does this?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMHO, not the place to test this. If the function gets passed an empty string, something went seriously wrong anyway. Throw an error or don't react at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// remove any leading or trailing spaces left over
 muuuch later:
// remove trailing dash, if there is one
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twice the work. Considering that each operation creates a whole new string, this is bad, even if performance is not an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// replace spaces with single dash
title = Regex.Replace(title, @"\s+", "-");
// if we end up with multiple dashes, collapse to single dash            
title = Regex.Replace(title, @"\-{2,}", "-");
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, basically twice the work: First, use regex to replace multiple spaces at once. Then, use regex again to replace multiple dashes at once. Two expressions to parse, two automata to construct in memory, iterate twice over the string, create two strings: All these operations can be collapsed to a single one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off the top of my head, without any testing whatsoever, this would be an equivalent solution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// make it all lower case
title = title.ToLower();
// remove entities
title = Regex.Replace(title, @"&amp;amp;\w+;", "");
// remove anything that is not letters, numbers, dash, or space
title = Regex.Replace(title, @"[^a-z0-9\-\s]", "");
// replace spaces
title = title.Replace(' ', '-');
// collapse dashes
title = Regex.Replace(title, @"-{2,}", "-");
// trim excessive dashes at the beginning
title = title.TrimStart(new [] {'-'});
// if it's too long, clip it
if (title.Length &amp;gt; 80)
    title = title.Substring(0, 79);
// remove trailing dashes
title = title.TrimEnd(new [] {'-'});
return title;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that this method uses string functions instead of regex functions and char functions instead of string functions whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;

        {
            OnSubmit(new EventArgs());
        }
    }

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my behavior script looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;DelayedSubmitBehavior = function(element) {
    DelayedSubmitBehavior.initializeBase(this, [element]);

    this._postBackEvent = null; // Stores the script required for the postback
}

DelayedSubmitBehavior.prototype = {
    // Delayed submit code removed for brevity, but normally this would be where 
    // initialize, dispose, and client-side event handlers would go

    // This is the client-side part of the PostBackEvent property
    get_PostBackEvent: function() {
        return this._postBackEvent;
    },
    set_PostBackEvent: function(value) {
        this._postBackEvent = value;
    }

    // This is the client-side event handler where the postback is initiated from
    _onTimerTick: function(sender, eventArgs) {
        // The following line evaluates the string var as javascript,
        // which will cause the desired postback
        eval(this._postBackEvent);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the server-side event can be handled the same way you'd handle an event on any other control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complete interface to this COM component corresponds to a software standard used in the chemical process industry (CAPE-OPEN) and as a result this COM component is supposed to be usable by a range of 3rd party executables that are out of my control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My component works as expected in many of these EXEs, but for one in particular the Edit() method just hangs without the dialog appearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if I make a call to &lt;code&gt;::MessageBox()&lt;/code&gt; immediately before &lt;code&gt;DoModal()&lt;/code&gt; the dialog displays and behaves correctly after first showing the MessageBox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a suspicion that the problem may be something to do with this particular EXE running as a 'hidden window application'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried using both NULL and the return value from &lt;code&gt;::GetConsoleWindow()&lt;/code&gt; as the dialog's parent, neither have worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dialog itself is an ATL/WTL CPropertySheetImpl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parent application (EXE) in question is out of my control as it is developed by a (mildly hostile) 3rd party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do know that I can successfully call &lt;code&gt;::MessageBox()&lt;/code&gt; or display the standard Windows File Dialog from my COM component, and that after doing so I am then able to display my custom dialog. I'm just unable to display my custom dialog without first displaying a 'standard' dialog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can anyone suggest how I might get it to display the dialog without first showing an unnecessary MessageBox? I know it is possible because I've seen this EXE display the dialogs from other COM components corresponding to the same interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to collect random data on a computer. SSL, SSH and VPNs would not be secure if you couldn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way software random number generator work is there is a &lt;em&gt;pool&lt;/em&gt; of random data that is gathered from many different places, such as clock drift, interrupt timings, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick to these schemes is in correctly estimating the &lt;em&gt;entropy&lt;/em&gt; (the posh name for the randomness). It doesn't matter whether the source is bias, as long as you estimate the entropy correctly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate this, the chance of me hitting the letter &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt; in this comment is much higher than that of &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; , so if I were to use key interrupts as a source of entropy it would be bias - but there is still some randomness to be had in that input. You can't predict exactly which sequence of letters will come next in this paragraph. You can extract entropy from this uncertainty and use it part of a random byte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good quality real-random generators like &lt;a href="http://www.schneier.com/yarrow.html"&gt;Yarrow&lt;/a&gt; have quite sophisticated entropy estimation built in to them and will only emit as many bytes as it can reliably say it has in its "randomness pool."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am torn on whether to use getters for the Track objects or just expose the members since the object is immutable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Track {
    public final String album;
    public final String artist;
    public final String title;
    public final String genre;
    public final String comment;

    public final String cover_id;

    public final long duration;
    public final long bitrate;
    public final long samplerate;
    public final long id;
    public final Date date;

    /* Some more stuff here */
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anybody who wants to know when something happened to a track in the library would implement this...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;interface TrackUpdateListener {
    void trackUpdate(Track oldTrack, Track newTrack);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how querys are built. Chain calls to your hearts content. the jury is still out on the get() though. There are some details missing, such as how I should handle wildcards and more advanced queries with disjunctions. I might just need some completion callback functionality, perhaps similar to the &lt;a href="http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~schmidt/PDF/ACT.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;Asynchronous Completion Token&lt;/a&gt;, but we'll see about that. Perhaps that will happen in an additional layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;interface TrackQuery extends Iterable&amp;lt;Track&amp;gt; {
    TrackQuery years(int from, int to);
    TrackQuery artist(String name);
    TrackQuery album(String name);
    TrackQuery id(long id);
    TrackQuery ids(long id[]);

    Future&amp;lt;Track[]&amp;gt; get();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;tracks.allTracks();
tracks.allTracks().artist("Front 242").album("Tyranny (For You)");
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tracks interface is mostly just the glue between the connection and the individual tracks. It will be the one implementing or managing meta-data caching, if any (as today, but I think I'll just remove it during the refactoring and see if I actually need it). Also, this provides medialib track updates as it would just be too much work to implement it by track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;interface Tracks {
    TrackQuery allTracks();

    void addUpdateListener(TrackUpdateListener listener);
    void removeUpdateListener(TrackUpdateListener listener);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use contrast not colour to differentiate in your design. This is to accommodate colour-blindness and poorly sighted users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use as limited a colour palette as you can. Pick one colour as your 'theme' and choose shades of that colour, and then maybe one or two contrasting colours to go with it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's much better to use the TableAdapter FillByDataXXXX() methods instead of GetDataByXXXX() methods because the DataTable passed into the fill method can be interrogated for clues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DataTable.GetErrors() returns an
array of DataRow instances in error&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DataRow.RowError contains a
description of the row error&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DataRow.GetColumnsInError() returns
an array of DataColumn instances in
error&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I wrapped up some interrogation code into a subclass of ConstraintException that's turned out to be a useful starting point for debugging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C# Example usage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Example.DataSet.fooDataTable table = new DataSet.fooDataTable();

try
{
 tableAdapter.Fill(table);
}
catch (ConstraintException ex)
{
 // pass the DataTable to DetailedConstraintException to get a more detailed Message property
 throw new DetailedConstraintException("error filling table", table, ex);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DetailedConstraintException : table fill failed&lt;br /&gt;
    Errors reported for ConstraintExceptionHelper.DataSet+fooDataTable [foo]&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display/Data value differences, such as String pairs of image names and a path for a control (or whatever). You want the path for the work under the hood, but the name to be visible to the user.&lt;/li&gt;

I find that a little annoying to use because they need a few more clicks or keypresses to get to, but at least you can get the job done (they tend to put things like input masks in here - regex, numerical etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One think that took a bit of getting used to is with the XtraGrid and Treelist, which if you want to do some custom display for specific cells, you have to hook up an event that fires before the cell is displayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I can see the vast majority of the time you should be using classes and the JITter should guarantee a good level of performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;structs have 'value type semantics', so will pass by value rather than by reference. We can see this difference in behaviour in the following example:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;using System;

namespace StructClassTest {

  struct A {
    public string Foobar { get; set; }
  }

  class B {
    public string Foobar { get; set; }
  }

  class Program {
    static void Main() {
      A a = new A();
      a.Foobar = "hi";
      B b = new B();
      b.Foobar = "hi";

      StructTest(a);
      ClassTest(b);

      Console.WriteLine("a.Foobar={0}, b.Foobar={1}", a.Foobar, b.Foobar);

      Console.ReadKey(true);
    }

    static void StructTest(A a) {
      a.Foobar = "hello";
    }

    static void ClassTest(B b) {
      b.Foobar = "hello";
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The struct will be passed by value so StructTest() will get it's own A struct and when it changes a.Foobar will change the Foobar of its new type. ClassTest() will receive a reference to b and thus the .Foobar property of b will be changed. Thus we'd obtain the following output:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a.Foobar=hi, b.Foobar=hello
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you desire value type semantics then that would be another reason to declare something as a struct. Note interestingly that the DateTime type in .net is a value type, so the .net architects decided that it was appropriate to assign it as such, it'd be interesting to determine why they did that :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Structure : does it obviously break into pieces, or are you making tradeoffs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usage : how will the data be analyzed/retrieved/grokked?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lifetime : how long is the data useful?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size : how much data is there?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One particular advantage of CSV files over RDBMSes is that they can be easy to condense and move around to practically any other machine. We do large data transfers, and everything's simple enough we just use one big CSV file, and easy to script using tools like rsync. To reduce repetition on big CSV files, you could use something like &lt;a href="http://yaml.org"&gt;YAML&lt;/a&gt;. I'm not sure I'd store anything like JSON or XML, unless you had significant relationship requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as not-mentioned alternatives, don't discount &lt;a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/core/"&gt;Hadoop&lt;/a&gt;, which is an open source implementation of MapReduce. This should work well if you have a TON of loosely structured data that needs to be analyzed, and you want to be in a scenario where you can just add 10 more machines to handle data processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I started trying to analyze performance that was essentially all timing numbers of different functions logged across around 20 machines. After trying to stick everything in a RDBMS, I realized that I really don't need to query the data again once I've aggregated it. And, it's only useful in it's aggregated format to me. So, I keep the log files around, compressed, and then leave the aggregated data in a DB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt; I'm more used to thinking with "big" sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video for Windows: old windows framework coming from the age of Win95 but still widely used because it is very simple to use. Unfortunately it supports only AVI files for which the proper VFW codec has been installed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;DirectShow: standard WinXP framework, it can basically load all formats you can play with Windows Media Player. Rather difficult to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/"&gt;Ffmpeg&lt;/a&gt;: more precisely libavcodec and libavformat that comes with Ffmpeg open- source multimedia utility. It is extremely powerful and can read a lot of formats (almost everything you can play with &lt;a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/"&gt;VLC&lt;/a&gt;) even if you don't have the codec installed on the system. It's quite complicated to use but you can always get inspired by the code of ffplay that comes shipped with it or by other implementations in open-source software. Anyway I think it's still much easier to use than DS (and much faster). It needs to be comipled by MinGW on Windows, but all the steps are explained very well &lt;a href="http://arrozcru.no-ip.org/ffmpeg/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (in this moment the link is down, hope not dead).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/quicktime/download/"&gt;QuickTime&lt;/a&gt;: the Apple framework is not the best solution for Windows platform, since it needs QuickTime app to be installed and also the proper QuickTime codec for every format; it does not support many formats, but its quite common in professional field (so some codec are actually only for QuickTime). Shouldn't be too difficult to implement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gstreamer.net/"&gt;Gstreamer&lt;/a&gt;: latest open source framework. I don't know much about it, I guess it wraps over some of the other systems (but I'm not sure).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this frameworks have been implemented as backend in OpenCv Highgui, except for DirectShow. The default framework for Win32 OpenCV is using VFW (and thus able only to open some AVI files), if you want to use the others you must download the CVS instead of the official release and still do some hacking on the code and it's anyway not too complete, for example FFMPEG backend doesn't allow to seek in the stream.
If you want to use QuickTime with OpenCV &lt;a href="http://path.berkeley.edu/~zuwhan/QTforOpenCVWin/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; can help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I'm kidding!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a good question, and something I experienced not too long ago. I was reorganising my codebase at work and was having problems of where to put what, and what to call it..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt; problem?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had classes doing too much. If you try to adhere to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle"&gt;single responsibility principle&lt;/a&gt; it will make everything all come together much nicer.. Rather than one monolithic &lt;em&gt;PrintHandler&lt;/em&gt; class, you could break it down into &lt;em&gt;PageHandler&lt;/em&gt; , &lt;em&gt;PageFormatter&lt;/em&gt; (and so on) and then have a master &lt;em&gt;Printer&lt;/em&gt; class which brings it all together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my re-org, it took me time, but I ended up binning a lot of duplicate code, got my codebase much more logical and learned a hell of a lot when it comes to thinking before throwing an extra method in a class :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; however recommend putting things like pattern names into the class name. The classes interface should make that obvious (like hiding the constructor for a singleton). There is nothing wrong with the generic name, if the class is serving a generic purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, according to the Hibernate documentation "Properties from superclasses not mapped as @MappedSuperclass are ignored."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I think this means that if I have these two classes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class A {
    private int foo;
}

@Entity
public class B extens A {
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then field &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; will not be mapped for class  B. Which makes sense. But if I have something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;@Entity
public class Problem {

@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
private Long id;

private String name;

public Long getId() {

public void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;
}
}

@Entity
public class UglyProblem extends Problem {

private int levelOfUgliness;

    return levelOfUgliness;
}

public void setLevelOfUgliness(int levelOfUgliness) {
    this.levelOfUgliness = levelOfUgliness;
}
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect the class UglyProblem to have fileds &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; and both classes to be mapped using same table. (In fact, this is exactly what happens, I have just checked again). I have got this table:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CREATE TABLE "problem" (

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I expect @ManyToOne person to be inherited by UglyProblem class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect that because all other mapped fields are inherited and I do not see any reason to make this exception for ManyToOne relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I saw that. In fact, I used Read-Only solution for my case. But my question was "Why..." :). I know that there is an explanation given by a member of hibernate team. I was not able to find it and that is why I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to find out the motivation of this design decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(if you interested how I have faced this problem: I inherited a project built using hibernate 3. It was Jboss 4.0.something + hibernate was already there (you'd download it all together). I was moving this project to Jboss 4.2.2 and I found out that there are inherited mappings of "@OneToMany mappedBy" and it worked fine on old setup...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears the week specified in the DayOfWeek enum starts on Sunday, so if we subtract 1 from this value that'll be equal to how many days the Monday is before the current date. We also need to map the Sunday (0) to equal 7 so given 1 - 7 = -6 the Sunday will map to the previous Monday:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;DateTime now = DateTime.Now;
int dayOfWeek = (int)now.DayOfWeek;
dayOfWeek = dayOfWeek == 0 ? 7 : dayOfWeek;
DateTime startOfWeek = now.AddDays(1 - (int)now.DayOfWeek);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code for the previous Sunday is simpler as we don't have to make this adjustment:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;DateTime now = DateTime.Now;
int dayOfWeek = (int)now.DayOfWeek;
DateTime startOfWeek = now.AddDays(-(int)now.DayOfWeek);

&lt;p&gt;To use git push to deploy your site you will need to do first set up a remote server in your .git/config file to push to. Then you need to configure a hook that will basically perform a git reset --hard to copy the code you just copied to the repository to the working directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctrine aside from Active Table and the general database abstraction thing (aka DBAL) has so many things (e.g. migrations) which make it worth checking out, so if you haven't set your mind on a DBAL yet, you need to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, what you don't want to do is use Access to front-end an Access database (mdb) from a remote location over a high-latency link.

  &lt;p&gt;What is the normal way people writing
  network code in Delphi use
  Windows-style overlapped asynchronous
  socket I/O?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, Indy has been the 'standard' library for socket I/O for a long while now - and it's based on blocking sockets. This means if you want asynchronous behaviour, you use additional thread(s) to connect/read/write data. To my mind this is actually a major advantage, as there's no need to manage any kind of state machine navigation, or worry about callback procs or similar stuff. I find the logic of my 'reading' thread is less cluttered and much more portable than non-blocking sockets would allow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indy &lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt; has been mostly bombproof, fast and reliable for us. However the move to Indy 10 for Tiburon is causing me a little concern.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;@Mike: "...the need to kill sockets to free threads...".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This made go "huh?" until I remembered our threading library uses an exception-based technique to kill 'waiting' threads safely. We call QueueUserAPC to queue a function which raises a C++ exception (NOT derived from class Exception) which should only be caught by our thread wrapper procedure. All destructors get called so the threads all terminate cleanly and tidy up on the way out.&lt;/p&gt;

There are two ways to call a method with a &lt;code&gt;params&lt;/code&gt; parameter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; Calling with an array of the parameter type, in which case the &lt;code&gt;params&lt;/code&gt; keyword has no effect and the array is passed directly to the method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;object[] array = new[] { "1", "2" };

// Foo receives the 'array' argument directly.
Foo( array );
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; Or, calling with an extended list of arguments, in which case the compiler will automatically wrap the list of arguments in a temporary array and pass that to the method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Foo receives a temporary array containing the list of arguments.
Foo( "1", "2" );

// This is equivalent to:
object[] temp = new[] { "1", "2" );
Foo( temp );
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to pass in an object array to a method with a "&lt;code&gt;params object[]&lt;/code&gt;" parameter, you can either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; Create a wrapper array manually and pass that directly to the method, as mentioned by &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36350/c-how-to-pass-a-single-object-to-a-params-object#36360"&gt;lassevk&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Foo( new object[] { array } );  // Equivalent to calling convention 1.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; Or, cast the argument to &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt;, as mentioned by &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36350/c-how-to-pass-a-single-object-to-a-params-object#36367"&gt;Adam&lt;/a&gt;, in which case the compiler will create the wrapper array for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Foo( (object)array );  // Equivalent to calling convention 2.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if the goal of the method is to process multiple object arrays, it may be easier to declare it with an explicit "&lt;code&gt;params object[][]&lt;/code&gt;" parameter. This would allow you to pass multiple arrays as arguments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void Foo( params object[][] arrays ) {
  foreach( object[] array in arrays ) {
    // process array
  }
}

...
Foo( new[] { "1", "2" }, new[] { "3", "4" } );

// Equivalent to:
object[][] arrays = new[] {
  new[] { "1", "2" },
  new[] { "3", "4" }
};
Foo( arrays );
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application in question is a Java/J2EE based web app that uses Hibernate.  The way I currently have things working is that the Hibernate mapped model objects all implement a common "Indexable" interface that can return a set of key/value pairs that are recorded in Lucene.  Whenever a CRUD operation is performed involving such an object I send it via JMS queue into a message driven bean that records in Lucene the primary key of the object and the key/value pairs returned from the index( ) method of the Indexable object that was provided.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main worries about this scheme is if the MDB gets behind and can't keep up with the indexing operations that are coming in or if some sort of error/exception stops an object from being index.  The result is an out-of-date index for either a sort, or long, period of time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically I was just wondering what kind of strategies others had come up with for this sort of thing.  Not necessarily looking for one correct answer but am imagining a list of "whiteboard" sort of ideas to get my brain thinking about alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why a lot of companies store their applications' connection strings at the machine level instead of the application level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just take the connection string out of the source code entirely. Then have everyone put &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; connection string in &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; machine.config.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has the added benefit of avoiding unnecessary app-specific environment logic, i.e. when  you copy your application to the staging server, the staging server already "knows" what database to use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;

The other problem is that this code block returns immediately, so no way to do other work when all the &lt;code&gt;do-something&lt;/code&gt;s are finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phone in question runs the Nokia Series 60 UI (these days called s60). Symbian phones have traditionally been split into the OS bit (Symbian OS v9.1, 9.2 etc) and the phone vendor buys or develops their own UI. A particular version of s60 will run on a specific version of Symbian OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a good place to start for development on your phone is Forum Nokia:
&lt;a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/resources/technologies/symbian/documentation/getting_started.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/resources/technologies/symbian/documentation/getting_started.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will cover the UI bits and pieces. I should add that UI vendors do perform a lot of OS customisation themselves (with varying degrees of self-control/quality) so differences in API's especially involving hardware can become esoteric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symbian itself does provide a decent level of quality of documentation, not up there with Microsoft but better than a lot of open source offerring. A good reference is the Symbian Developer Network:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://developer.symbian.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://developer.symbian.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding tools. The standard development environment these days is Nokia's Carbide platform which is based on Eclipse, I think it is fair to say that if you can put up with Eclipse you'll be fine, if you can't... well... command line time for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carbide has on-device debugging and includes the compilers for PC and ARM (GCC-E) targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most app development is done using the Symbian Emulator which will be part of the SDK for your phone from Nokia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are ready to put the app on the phone, you need to look at Symbian Signed:
&lt;a href="http://www.newlc.com/new-symbian-signed-processes-are-now-available" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.newlc.com/new-symbian-signed-processes-are-now-available&lt;/a&gt;
A lot of people have had reasonable complaints that it can be a bit confusing, but as a non-commercial developer I believe "Open Signed" is supposed to be the easiest.&lt;/p&gt;

I usually try to keep high level code (basically anything except for the real plumbing code) above 80, where 90+ would be good. It adds a competitive element to programming as maintainable as possible to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code analysis tool really shines in the area of dependencies and number of branches within a method though. More branches means harder testing, which makes it more error prone. Dependencies, same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other people's code I use the maintainability index to spot possible bad parts in the code, so I know where to review it. Also, methods/classes with a high number of lines are an indication of poor code to me (unless it can't be avoided, again, the plumbing works).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I think it mainly depends on how often your code will change. Code that's expected to change a lot has to score higher in maintainability than your typical 'write once' code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, they can be a bit wordy to set up, and you sometimes have to pass them the same info twice.  I've used MDB2 in a couple of projects, and I tended to write a thin veneer around it, especially for specifying the types of fields.  I generally make an object that knows about a particular table and its columns, and then a helper function in that fills in field types for me when I call an MDB2 query function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function MakeTableTypes($TableName, $FieldNames)
{
    $Types = array();

    foreach ($FieldNames as $FieldName =&amp;gt; $FieldValue)
    {
        $Types[] = $this-&amp;gt;Tables[$TableName]['schema'][$FieldName]['type'];
    }

    return $Types;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously this object has a map of table names -&gt; schemas that it knows about, and just extracts the types of the fields you specify, and returns an matching type array suitable for use with an MDB2 query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MDB2 (and similar libraries) then handle the parameter substitution for you, so for update/insert queries, you just build a hash/map from column name to value, and use the 'autoExecute' functions to build and execute the relevant query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function UpdateArticle($Article)
{
    $Types = $this-&amp;gt;MakeTableTypes($table_name, $Article);

    $res = $this-&amp;gt;MDB2-&amp;gt;extended-&amp;gt;autoExecute($table_name,
        $Article,
        MDB2_AUTOQUERY_UPDATE,
        'id = '.$this-&amp;gt;MDB2-&amp;gt;quote($Article['id'], 'integer'),
        $Types);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and MDB2 will build the query, escaping everything properly, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd recommend measuring performance with MDB2 though, as it pulls in a fair bit of code that might cause you problems if you're not running a PHP accelerator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I say, the setup overhead seems daunting at first, but once it's done the queries can be simpler/more symbolic to write and (especially) modify. I think MDB2 should know a bit more about your schema, which would simpify some of the commonly used API calls, but you can reduce the annoyance of this by encapsulating the schema yourself, as I mentioned above, and providing simple accessor functions that generate the arrays MDB2 needs to perform these queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course you can just do flat SQL queries as a string using the query() function if you want, so you're not forced to switch over to the full 'MDB2 way' - you can try it out piecemeal, and see if you hate it or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;chars_before - is the number of
chars you wish to select before the

&lt;li&gt;total_chars - is the
total number of chars you wish to
select&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SUBSTRING(field_name, LOCATE('keyword', field_name) - 15, 30)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: as aryeh pointed out, any negative values in SUBSTRING() buggers things up considerably - for example if the keyword is found within the first [chars_before] chars of the field, then the last [chars_before] chars of data in the field are returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The canonical WAVE format is very simple, see &lt;a href="http://www.lightlink.com/tjweber/StripWav/Canon.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.lightlink.com/tjweber/StripWav/Canon.html&lt;/a&gt;. A header (first 44 bytes) + the wave-data. You don't need any library to implement that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In C/C++, the corresponding data structure would look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-cpp prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;typedef struct _WAVstruct
{
    char headertag[4];
    unsigned int remnantlength;
    char fileid[4];

    char fmtchunktag[4];
    unsigned int fmtlength;
    unsigned short fmttag;

    unsigned int samplerate;
    unsigned int bypse;
    unsigned short ba;
    unsigned short bipsa;

    char datatag[4];
    unsigned int datalength;

    void* data; //&amp;lt;--- that's where the raw sound-data goes
}* WAVstruct;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure about Java. I guess you'll have to substitute "struct" with "class" and "void* data" with "char[] data" or "short[] data" or "int[] data", corresponding to the number of bits per sample, as defined in the field bipsa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fill it with data, you would use something like that in C/C++:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-cpp prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;int data2WAVstruct(unsigned short channels, unsigned short bipsa, unsigned int samplerate, unsigned int datalength, void* data, WAVstruct result)
{
    result-&amp;gt;headertag[0] = 'R';
    result-&amp;gt;headertag[1] = 'I';
    result-&amp;gt;headertag[2] = 'F';
    result-&amp;gt;headertag[3] = 'F';
    result-&amp;gt;remnantlength = 44 + datalength - 8;
    result-&amp;gt;fileid[0] = 'W';
    result-&amp;gt;fileid[1] = 'A';
    result-&amp;gt;fileid[2] = 'V';
    result-&amp;gt;fileid[3] = 'E';

    result-&amp;gt;fmtchunktag[0] = 'f';
    result-&amp;gt;fmtchunktag[1] = 'm'; 
    result-&amp;gt;fmtchunktag[2] = 't';
    result-&amp;gt;fmtchunktag[3] = ' ';
    result-&amp;gt;fmtlength = 0x00000010;
    result-&amp;gt;fmttag = 1;
    result-&amp;gt;channels = channels;
    result-&amp;gt;samplerate = samplerate;
    result-&amp;gt;bipsa = bipsa;
    result-&amp;gt;ba = channels*bipsa / 8;
    result-&amp;gt;bypse = samplerate*result-&amp;gt;ba;

    result-&amp;gt;datatag[0] = 'd';
    result-&amp;gt;datatag[1] = 'a';
    result-&amp;gt;datatag[2] = 't';
    result-&amp;gt;datatag[3] = 'a';
    result-&amp;gt;datalength = datalength;

    result-&amp;gt;data = data; // &amp;lt;--- that's were the data comes in

    return 0; // an error code, not implemented, yet ...; in Java: return result
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I'm not sure about Java but the conversion should be straightforward if you convert the void-pointer to an array corresponding to the bitrate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then simply write the entire structure to a file to get a playable wave file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional Unix/Linux way would be to write the PID to a file (typically in /var/run) and check to see if that file exists on startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e.g. the pidfile being located at /var/run/myscript.pid then you'd check to see if that exists before running the program. There are a few tricks to avoid race conditions involving using O_EXCL (exclusing locking) to open the file and symbolic links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However unlikely, you should try to code to avoid race conditions by using atomic operations on the filesystem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally, the popen family was in the os module and was an implementation of the venerable posix popen.  The movement to the subprocess module would have been an opportune time to rename them, but I guess that keeping Popen makes it easier to find in the docs for those who have a long history with python or even to the venerable posix functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From it's earliest posix incarnation, &lt;code&gt;Popen&lt;/code&gt; has always been meant to open a Process and allow you to read and write from it's stdio like a file. Thus the mnemonic for &lt;code&gt;Popen&lt;/code&gt; is that it is short for &lt;code&gt;ProccesOpen&lt;/code&gt; in an attempt to kind of, sorta, look like open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this was first published in 1936, the advice contained within is still as fresh and appropriate as ever. Don't be put off by the name. This isn't some underhand guide to having your way with unsuspecting victims, but rather common sense advice on how to get on with people, how to nurture relationships and make the most of yourself and your fellow man (and woman).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is well known that technical folk (including programmers) are often thought of as not being terribly 'people oriented' (whether this is a justified stereotype or not is subject of another discussion) and so this book is an invaluable resource for teaching you the finer points of human interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's warm, heartfelt, sturdy, straightforward and timelessly written. Highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I did an internship in a physics research group at a university. In this group, we mostly used &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LabVIEW"&gt;LabVIEW&lt;/a&gt; to write programs for controlling our setups, doing data acquisition and analyzing our data. For the first two purposes, that works quite OK, but for data analysis, it's a real pain. On top of that, everyone was mostly self-taught, so code that was written was generally quite a mess (no wonder that every PhD quickly decided to rewrite everything from scratch). Version control was unknown, and impossible to set up because of strict software and network regulations from the IT department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, things actually worked out surprisingly OK, but how do people in the natural sciences do their software development?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Questions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some concrete questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What languages/environments have you used for developing scientific software, especially data analysis? What libraries? (for example, what do you use for plotting?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was there any training for people without any significant background in programming?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you have anything like version control, and bug tracking?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How would you go about trying to create a decent environment for programming, without getting too much in the way of the individual scientists (especially physicists are stubborn people!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary of answers thus far&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answers (or my interpretation of them) thus far: (2008-10-11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Languages/packages that seem to be the most widely used:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LabVIEW&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SciPy"&gt;SciPy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy"&gt;NumPy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.scipy.org/PyLab"&gt;PyLab&lt;/a&gt;, etc. (See also Brandon's reply for downloads and links)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C/C++&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB"&gt;MATLAB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Version control is used by nearly all respondents; bug tracking and other processes are much less common.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Software Carpentry course is a good way to teach programming and development techniques to scientists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to improve things?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't force people to follow strict protocols.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up an environment yourself, and show the benefits to others. Help them to start working with version control, bug tracking, etc. themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reviewing other people's code can help, but be aware that not everyone may appreciate that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

When the execution of a method passes outside of that method, into another object, and back again, you have a dependency.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you test that code path with the actual dependency, you are not unit testing; you are integration testing.  While that's good and necessary, it isn't unit testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your dependency is buggy, your test may be affected in such a way to return a false positive.  For instance, you may pass the dependency an unexpected null, and the dependency may not throw on null as it is documented to do.  Your test does not enounter a null argument exception as it should have, and the test passes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, you may find its hard, if not impossible, to reliably get the dependent object to return exactly what you want during a test.  That also includes throwing expected exceptions within tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mock replaces that dependency.  You set expectations on calls to the dependent object, set the exact return values it should give you to perform the test you want, and/or what exceptions to throw so that you can test your exception handling code.  In this way you can test the unit in question easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR:  Mock every dependency your unit test touches.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, we want to test that method &lt;code&gt;sendInvitations(MailServer mailServer)&lt;/code&gt; calls &lt;code&gt;MailServer.createMessage()&lt;/code&gt; exactly once, and also calls &lt;code&gt;MailServer.sendMessage(m)&lt;/code&gt; exactly once, and no other methods are called on the &lt;code&gt;MailServer&lt;/code&gt; interface. This is when we can use mock objects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With mock objects, instead of passing a real &lt;code&gt;MailServerImpl&lt;/code&gt;, or a test &lt;code&gt;TestMailServer&lt;/code&gt;, we can pass a mock implementation of the &lt;code&gt;MailServer&lt;/code&gt; interface. Before we pass a mock &lt;code&gt;MailServer&lt;/code&gt;, we "train" it, so that it knows what method calls to expect and what return values to return. At the end, the mock object asserts, that all expected methods were called as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds good in theory, but there are also some downsides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Mock shortcomings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a mock framework in place, you are tempted to use mock object &lt;em&gt;every time&lt;/em&gt; you need to pass an interface to the class under the test. This way you end up &lt;strong&gt;testing interactions even when it is not necessary&lt;/strong&gt;. Unfortunately, unwanted (accidental) testing of interactions is bad, because then you're testing that a particular requirement is implemented in a particular way, instead of that the implementation produced the required result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's an example in pseudocode. Let's suppose we've created a &lt;code&gt;MySorter&lt;/code&gt; class and we want to test it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// the correct way of testing
testSort() {
    testList = [1, 7, 3, 8, 2] 
    MySorter.sort(testList)

    assert testList equals [1, 2, 3, 7, 8]
}


// incorrect, testing implementation
testSort() {
    testList = [1, 7, 3, 8, 2] 
    MySorter.sort(testList)

    assert that compare(1, 2) was called once 
    assert that compare(1, 3) was not called 
    assert that compare(2, 3) was called once 
    ....
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(In this example we assume that it's not a particular sorting algorithm, such as quick sort, that we want to test; in that case, the latter test would actually be valid.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such an extreme example it's obvious why the latter example is wrong. When we change the implementation of &lt;code&gt;MySorter&lt;/code&gt;, the first test does a great job of making sure we still sort correctly, which is the whole point of tests - they allow us to change the code safely. On the other hand, the latter test &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; breaks and it is actively harmful; it hinders refactoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Mocks as stubs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mock frameworks often allow also less strict usage, where we don't have to specify exactly how many times methods should be called and what parameters are expected; they allow creating mock objects that are used as &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html"&gt;stubs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's suppose we have a method &lt;code&gt;sendInvitations(PdfFormatter pdfFormatter, MailServer mailServer)&lt;/code&gt; that we want to test. The &lt;code&gt;PdfFormatter&lt;/code&gt; object can be used to create the invitation. Here's the test:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;testInvitations() {
   // train as stub
   pdfFormatter = create mock of PdfFormatter
   let pdfFormatter.getCanvasWidth() returns 100
   let pdfFormatter.getCanvasHeight() returns 300
   let pdfFormatter.addText(x, y, text) returns true 
   let pdfFormatter.drawLine(line) does nothing

   // train as mock
   mailServer = create mock of MailServer
   expect mailServer.sendMail() called exactly once

   // do the test
   sendInvitations(pdfFormatter, mailServer)

   assert that all pdfFormatter expectations are met
   assert that all mailServer expectations are met
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, we don't really care about the &lt;code&gt;PdfFormatter&lt;/code&gt; object so we just train it to quietly accept any call and return some sensible canned return values for all methods that &lt;code&gt;sendInvitation()&lt;/code&gt; happens to call at this point. How did we come up with exactly this list of methods to train? We simply ran the test and kept adding the methods until the test passed. Notice, that we trained the stub to respond to a method without having a clue why it needs to call it, we simply added everything that the test complained about. We are happy, the test passes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what happens later, when we change &lt;code&gt;sendInvitations()&lt;/code&gt;, or some other class that &lt;code&gt;sendInvitations()&lt;/code&gt; uses, to create more fancy pdfs? Our test suddenly fails because now more methods of &lt;code&gt;PdfFormatter&lt;/code&gt; are called and we didn't train our stub to expect them. And usually it's not only one test that fails in situations like this, it's any test that happens to use, directly or indirectly, the &lt;code&gt;sendInvitations()&lt;/code&gt; method. We have to fix all those tests by adding more trainings. Also notice, that we can't remove methods no longer needed, because we don't know which of them are not needed. Again, it hinders refactoring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the readability of test suffered terribly, there's lots of code there that we didn't write because of we wanted to, but because we had to; it's not us who want that code there. Tests that use mock objects look very complex and are often difficult to read. The tests should help the reader understand, how the class under the test should be used, thus they should be simple and straightforward. If they are not readable, nobody is going to maintain them; in fact, it's easier to delete them than to maintain them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to fix that? Easily:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try using real classes instead of mocks whenever possible. Use the real &lt;code&gt;PdfFormatterImpl&lt;/code&gt;. If it's not possible, change the real classes to make it possible. Not being able to use a class in tests usually points to some problems with the class. Fixing the problems is a win-win situation - you fixed the class and you have a simpler test. On the other hand, not fixing it and using mocks is a no-win situation - you didn't fix the real class and you have more complex, less readable tests that hinder further refactorings. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try creating a simple test implementation of the interface instead of mocking it in each test, and use this test class in all your tests. Create &lt;code&gt;TestPdfFormatter&lt;/code&gt; that does nothing. That way you can change it once for all tests and your tests are not cluttered with lengthy setups where you train your stubs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, mock objects have their use, but when not used carefully, &lt;strong&gt;they often encourage bad practices, testing implementation details, hinder refactoring and produce difficult to read and difficult to maintain tests&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

There is very little programming training in my field.  Most folks are either self-taught, or learned their programming skills from classes taken previously or outside the discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a big fan of version control.  I used Vault running on my home server for all the code for my dissertation.

&lt;p&gt;As for encouraging others to use version control and the like, that's really the problem I'm facing now.  I'm planning on forcing my grad students to use it on research projects they're doing for me, and encouraging them to use it for their own research.  If I teach a class involving programming, I'll probably force the students to use version control there too (grading them on what's in the repository).  As far as my colleagues and their grad students go, all I can really do is make a server available and rely on gentle persuasion and setting a good example.  Frankly, at this point I think it's more important to get them doing regular backups than get them on source control (some folks are carrying around the only copy of their research data on USB flash drives).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to work for National Instruments, R&amp;amp;D, where I wrote software for NI RF &amp;amp; Communication toolkits. We used LabVIEW quite a bit, and here are the practices we followed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Source control. NI uses Perforce. We did the regular thing - dev/trunk branches, continuous integration, the works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We wrote automated test suites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had a few people who came in with a background in signal processing and communication. We used to have regular code reviews, and best practices documents to make sure their code was up to the mark.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite the code reviews, there were a few occasions when "software guys", like me had to rewrite some of this code for efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I know exactly what you mean about stubborn people! We had folks who used to think that pointing out a potential performance improvement in their code was a direct personal insult! It goes without saying that that this calls for good management. I thought the best way to deal with these folks is to go slowly, not press to hard for changes and if necessary be prepared to do the dirty work. [Example: write a test suite for their code].&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Major programing work used to be done mostly in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran"&gt;Fortran&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN%5FProgram%5FLibrary"&gt;CERNLIB&lt;/a&gt; (PAW, MINUIT, ...) and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEANT%5F%28program%29"&gt;GEANT3&lt;/a&gt;, recently it has mostly been done in C++ with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROOT"&gt;ROOT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geant4"&gt;Geant4&lt;/a&gt;. There are a number of other libraries and tools in specialized use, and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LabVIEW"&gt;LabVIEW&lt;/a&gt; sees some use here and there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data acquisition in my end of this business has often meant fairly low level work. Often in C, sometimes even in assembly, but this is dying out as the hardware gets more capable. On the other hand, many of the boards are now built with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable%5Fgate%5Farray"&gt;FPGA&lt;/a&gt;s which need gate twiddling...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One-offs, graphical interfaces, etc. use almost anything (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tk%5F%28framework%29"&gt;Tcl/Tk&lt;/a&gt; used to be big, and I've been seeing more Perl/Tk and Python/Tk lately) including a number of packages that exist mostly inside the particle physics community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many people writing code have little or no formal training, and process is transmitted very unevenly by oral tradition, but most of the software group leaders take process seriously and read as much as necessary to make up their deficiencies in this area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Version control for the main tools is ubiquitous. But many individual programmers neglect it for their smaller tasks. Formal bug tracking tools are less common, as are nightly builds, unit testing, and regression tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get on the good side of the local software leaders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement the process you want to use in your own area, and encourage those you let in to use it too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait. Physicists are empirical people. If it helps, they will (eventually!) notice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more suggestion for improving things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put a little time in to helping anyone you work directly with. Review their code. Tell them about algorithmic complexity/code generation/DRY or whatever basic thing they never learned because some professor threw a Fortran book at them once and said "make it work". Indoctrinate them on process issues. They are smart people, and they will learn if you give them a chance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Also, look around if there is something specific for your domain (as is &lt;a href="http://www.r-project.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; for statistics). This has the advantage of already working with the concepts the users are familiar with and having specialized code for specific situations (for example calculating standard deviations, applying statistical tests, etc in the case of R).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wish to use a more generic scripting language, I would go with Python. Two things it has going for it are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The interactive shell where you can experiment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its clear (although sometimes lengthy) syntax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an added advantage, it has libraries for most of the things you would want to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;

  were implemented this way to support

I'm trying to achieve a decent rendering speed by implementing some tricks from a c++ implementation and have run into a spot of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objects in the scenes which the ray-tracer renders are stored in a KdTree structure and the tree's nodes are, in turn, stored in an array. The optimization I'm having problems with is while trying to fit as many tree nodes as possible into a cache line. One means of doing this is for nodes to contain a pointer to the left child node only. It is then implicit that the right child follows directly after the left one in the array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nodes are structs and during tree construction they are succesfully put into the array by a static memory manager class. When I begin to traverse the tree it, at first, seems to work just fine. Then at a point early in the rendering (about the same place each time), the left child pointer of the root node is suddenly pointing at a null pointer. I have come to the conclusion that the garbage collecter has moved the structs as the array lies on the heap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've tried several things to pin the addresses in memory but none of them seems to last for the entire application lifetime as I need. The 'fixed' keyword only seems to help during single method calls and declaring 'fixed' arrays can only be done on simple types which a node isn't. Is there a good way to do this or am I just too far down the path of stuff C# wasn't meant for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Btw, changing to c++, while perhaps the better choice for a high performance program, is not an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, class methods are suitable anytime you would like to have a method which naturally fits into the namespace of the class, but is not associated with a particular instance of the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, in the excellent &lt;a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Unipath/0.2.1"&gt;unipath&lt;/a&gt; module:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Current directory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Return the actual current directory; e.g., &lt;code&gt;Path("/tmp/my_temp_dir")&lt;/code&gt;. This is a class method.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;.chdir()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make self the current directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the current directory is process wide, the &lt;code&gt;cwd&lt;/code&gt; method has no particular instance with which it should be associated.  However, changing the &lt;code&gt;cwd&lt;/code&gt; to the directory of a given &lt;code&gt;Path&lt;/code&gt; instance should indeed be an instance method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmmm... as &lt;code&gt;Path.cwd()&lt;/code&gt; does indeed return a &lt;code&gt;Path&lt;/code&gt; instance, I guess it could be considered to be a factory method...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can pin things in memory but this may cause more problems than it solves.  For one thing, it prevents the garbage collector from compacting memory properly, and may impact performance in that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I would say from your post is that using structs may not help performance as you hope.  C# fails to inline any method calls involving structs, and even though they've fixed this in their latest runtime beta, structs frequently don't perform that well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I would say C++ tricks like this don't generally tend to carry over too well into C#.  You may have to learn to let go a bit; there can be other more subtle ways to improve performance ;)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Seriously speaking, LINQ to SQL had it's support for n-tier architecture see DataContext.Update method&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of what I've read suggests that the business logic wraps the DataContext - in other words you wrap the update in the way that you suggest.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way i traditionally write business objects i usually encapsulate the "Load methods" in the BO as well; so I might have a method named LoadEmployeesAndManagers that returns a list of employees and their immediate managers (this is a contrived example) .  Maybe its just me, but in my front end I'd rather see e.LoadEmployeesAndManagers() than some long LINQ statement.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, using LINQ it would probably look something like this (not checked for syntax correctness):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var emps = from e in Employees
                join m in Employees
                on e.ManagerEmpID equals m.EmpID
                select new
                          { e,
                            m.FullName
                          };
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if I understand things correctly, if I put this in say a class library and call it from my front end, the only way I can return this is as an IEnumerable, so I lose my strong typed goodness.  The only way I'd be able to return a strongly typed object would be to create my own Employees class (plus a string field for manager name) and fill it from the results of my LINQ to SQL statement and then return that.  But this seems counter intuitive... what exactly did LINQ to SQL buy me if I have to do all that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that I might be looking at things the wrong way; any enlightenment would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

1. VMware virtual machines are portable across different types of hardware.  IIRC, Hyper-V uses the drivers from the Host OS.&lt;br /&gt;
2. VMware virtual machines are portable across different VMware products (although you may need to use their converter tool to go from some hosted virtual machines to ESX or ESXi).&lt;br /&gt;
3. The VMware platforms have been in use much longer, and are quite mature products and generally better-known for troubleshooting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With VMware, you could develop and test a virtual machine on your local system using VMware Workstation, Fusion, Server, or Player, and then deploy it to a production server later.  With Hyper-V, I believe you would have to build the virtual machine on the target box for best results.  If performance isn't really that big of an issue, then VMware Server may be the best option, for it can run most .vmx machines directly and is generally a bit easier to manage; if performance becomes critical, you still have the ESX or ESXi upgrade option that you can use those same virtual machines with.&lt;/p&gt;

Since threads use a lot of resources - reserved stack address space, committed stack memory, and kernel transitions for context switches - they do not scale when you need to support hundreds of connections, much less thousands or more.&lt;/p&gt;

The ID is passed from request to request using a cookie called PHPSESSID or something like that (you can view the cookies a websites sets with the help of your browser ... on Firefox you have Firebug + FireCookie and the wonderful Web Developer Toolbar ... with which you can view the list of cookies without a sweat).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So ... PHP is passing the session ID through the PHPSESSID cookie. But you can pass the session ID as a plain GET request parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when you place the html link to the ugly domain name, assuming that it is the same PHP server (with the same sessions initialized), you can put it like this ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;www.myIsv.com/myWebSite/?PHPSESSID=&amp;lt;?=session_id()?&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven't worked with PHP for a while, but I think this will work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I understand they're not nearly as performant as Iron Python that is developed by the same team. I don't know if this is because Iron Ruby is using the DLR a lot more and that still needs to be optimized or if they need to optimize the Iron Ruby implementation itself more. But I guess it is good news because they can get it a lot faster. So if you're already happy with performance you'll get a lot happier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are generally 3 fonts that are in some form or other always supported. These fonts are Adobe Times, Adobe Helvetica, and Adobe Courier. The problem is that while every system and foundry have a clone of these, they have different names. They are also not entirely the same, but have the same metrics. The windows trio: Arial, Times New Roman, and Courier New are the monotype clones of them. On linux these have been provided as bitmap fonts by adobe, and as outlines in form of the URW Nimbus {Sans, Roman, Mono} clones. The outlines however are not pretty on screen (they are on a printer) as they lack hinting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution would be to go for a multichoice for websites. As microsoft has at some point made the &lt;a href="http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow"&gt;"core fonts"&lt;/a&gt; available for redistribution, many unix/linux systems do have those fonts available. So go with them. The liberation fonts are straight clones of the MS/monotype fonts, so should go ok as alternatives with a similar experience. Then go for "Helvetica", "Times", and "Courier" before the sans/serif/mono choice that puts you in the user's hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; If users will be adding and removing items from an object's collection, then a simple get-only collection property is best (option #1 from the original question):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;private readonly Collection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; myCollection_ = new ...;
public Collection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; MyCollection {
  get { return this.myCollection_; }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strategy is used for the &lt;code&gt;Items&lt;/code&gt; collections on the WindowsForms and WPF &lt;code&gt;ItemsControl&lt;/code&gt; controls, where users add and remove items they want the control to display. These controls publish the actual collection and use callbacks or event listeners to keep track of items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WPF also exposes some settable collections to allow users to display a collection of items they control, such as the &lt;code&gt;ItemsSource&lt;/code&gt; property on &lt;code&gt;ItemsControl&lt;/code&gt; (option #3 from the original question). However, this is not a common use case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; If users will only be reading data maintained by the object, then you can use a readonly collection, as &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35007/how-to-expose-a-collection-property#35065"&gt;Quibblesome&lt;/a&gt; suggested:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;private readonly List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; myPrivateCollection_ = new ...;
private ReadOnlyCollection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; myPrivateCollectionView_;
public ReadOnlyCollection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; MyCollection {
  get {
    if( this.myPrivateCollectionView_ == null ) { /* lazily initialize view */ }
    return this.myPrivateCollectionView_;
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;code&gt;ReadOnlyCollection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; provides a live view of the underlying collection, so you only need to create the view once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the internal collection does not implement &lt;code&gt;IList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, or if you want to restrict access to more advanced users, you can instead wrap access to the collection through an enumerator:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; MyCollection {
  get {
    foreach( T item in this.myPrivateCollection_ )
      yield return item;
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach is simple to implement and also provides access to all the members without exposing the internal collection. However, it does require that the collection remain unmodfied, as the BCL collection classes will throw an exception if you try to enumerate a collection after it has been modified. If the underlying collection is likely to change, you can either create a light wrapper that will enumerate the collection safely, or return a copy of the collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;3)&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, if you need to expose arrays rather than higher-level collections, then you should return a copy of the array to prevent users from modifying it (option #2 from the orginal question):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;private T[] myArray_;
public T[] GetMyArray( ) {
  T[] copy = new T[this.myArray_.Length];
  this.myArray_.CopyTo( copy, 0 );
  return copy;
  // Note: if you are using LINQ, calling the 'ToArray( )' 
  //  extension method will create a copy for you.
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should not expose the underlying array through a property, as you will not be able to tell when users modify it. To allow modifying the array, you can either add a corresponding &lt;code&gt;SetMyArray( T[] array )&lt;/code&gt; method, or use a custom indexer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public T this[int index] {
  get { return this.myArray_[index]; }
  set {
    // TODO: validate new value; raise change event; etc.
    this.myArray_[index] = value;
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(of course, by implementing a custom indexer, you will be duplicating the work of the BCL classes :)&lt;/p&gt;

However, if you're looking for an alternative to using reflection, and have access to the source you're testing, this will still be an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is possible merit in testing private methods of a class, particularly with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development"&gt;test driven development&lt;/a&gt;, where you would like to design small tests before you write any code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a test with access to private members and methods can test areas of code which are difficult to target specifically with access only to public methods. If a public method has several steps involved, it can consist of several private methods, which can then be tested individually. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can test to a finer granularity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;test code must reside in the same
file as source code, which can be
more difficult to maintain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;similarly with .class output files, they must remain within the same package as declared in source code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if continuous testing requires this method, it may be a signal that the private methods should be extracted, which could be tested in the traditional, public way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a convoluted example of how this would work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// import statements and package declarations

public class ClassToTest 
{
    private int decrement(int toDecrement) {
     toDecrement--;
     return toDecrement;
    }

    // constructor and rest of class

    public static class StaticInnerTest extends TestCase
    {
     public StaticInnerTest(){
      super();
     }

     public void testDecrement(){
      int number = 10;
      ClassToTest toTest= new ClassToTest();
      int decremented = toTest.decrement(number);
      assertEquals(9, decremented);
     }

     public static void main(String[] args) {
      junit.textui.TestRunner.run(StaticInnerTest.class);
     }

    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inner class would be compiled to &lt;code&gt;ClassToTest$StaticInnerTest&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example of the problem statement:&lt;/strong&gt; I want a checkbox that says "Adjust prices by &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;X&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;Y&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt; after loading," where &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;X&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a number---adjustable with a &lt;code&gt;NumericUpDown&lt;/code&gt;---and &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;Y&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt; is either "percent" or "dollars," with the choices being made by a &lt;code&gt;ComboBox&lt;/code&gt;. This will be on a single line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The complication:&lt;/strong&gt; I want to be able to change my fonts for all these controls (basically setting them to &lt;code&gt;System.Drawing.Fonts.MessageBoxFont&lt;/code&gt;, which is Tahoma 8 pt on Windows XP/etc. and Segoe UI 9 pt on Vista), without messing up my layout, which with my current &lt;code&gt;Position&lt;/code&gt;-property--setting paradigm does not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More generally, I'd like the controls to be dynamically laid out in a font-independent way, so that the &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;X&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;NumericUpDown&lt;/code&gt; fits snugly into the space between "by " and the &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;Y&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;ComboBox&lt;/code&gt;, and similarly the &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;X&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;ComboBox&lt;/code&gt; fits in with respect to the &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;X&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;CheckBox&lt;/code&gt; and the string " after loading" to its right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The part everyone seems to miss:&lt;/strong&gt; This is all nested within a &lt;code&gt;CheckBox&lt;/code&gt;. So, ideally, clicking on the words "after loading" should check/uncheck the checkbox, and draw that little highlight rectangle around "Adjust prices by&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;after loading." So just slapping an extra &lt;code&gt;Label&lt;/code&gt; on the end doesn't work, because then it doesn't toggle the &lt;code&gt;CheckBox&lt;/code&gt;; similarly, trying to band-aid things by hooking up such a &lt;code&gt;Label&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;code&gt;Click&lt;/code&gt; event won't produce the desired highlight-rectangle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solutions?&lt;/strong&gt; At this point I'm thinking either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rethink the problem, somehow, maybe with an ugly solution like two separate lines of text: "Adjust found prices after loading" (&lt;code&gt;CheckBox&lt;/code&gt;), "Adjustment amount:" (&lt;code&gt;NumericUpDown&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ComboBox&lt;/code&gt;). This is really bad because my options box is absolutely full of options of this type (i.e. the type in the example), so it would at least double in vertical size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some sort of custom control? &lt;code&gt;SplittableCheckBox&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some kind of magic with a &lt;code&gt;TableLayout&lt;/code&gt; control? (Pretty sure this fails at "the part everyone seems to miss.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give up and either go back to MS Sans Serif, or use Tahoma uniformly, or package Segoe UI with my application, thus disrespecting the system default fonts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(New, via edit) Switch to WPF, if someone can convince me that it supports this scenario exactly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Unless it is doing something unsafe (P/Invoke, unsafe code), the behaviour you are seeing is a bug in your program, and not due to the behaviour of the CLR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, what do you mean by 'pointer', with respect to links between structures? Do you literally mean an unsafe KdTree* pointer? Don't do that. Instead, use an index into the array. Since I expect that all nodes for a single tree are stored in the same array, you won't need a separate reference to the array. Just a single index will do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you really really must use KdTree* pointers, then your static memory manager should allocate a large block using e.g. Marshal.AllocHGlobal or another unmanaged memory source; it should both treat this large block as a KdTree array (i.e. index a KdTree* C-style) &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; it should suballocate nodes from this array, by bumping a "free" pointer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ever have to resize this array, then you'll need to update all the pointers, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic lesson here is that unsafe pointers and managed memory do &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; mix outside of 'fixed' blocks, which of course have stack frame affinity (i.e. when the function returns, the pinned behaviour goes away). There is a way to pin arbitrary objects, like your array, using GCHandle.Alloc(yourArray, GCHandleType.Pinned), but you almost certainly don't want to go down that route.&lt;/p&gt;

If done right, you will not be able to tell if they were made as part of an AJAX call from your webapp or by hand/other means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two scenarios I can think of which you might be talking about when you say you want to make sure that only your AJAX calls can post data: either you don't want a malicious user to be able to post data that interferes with another user's data or you actually want to restrict the posts to being in the "flow" of a multi-request operation.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are concerned with the first case (someone posting malicious data to/as another user) the solution is the same whether you are using AJAX or not -- you just have to authenticate the user through whatever means is necessary -- usually via session cookie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are concerned with the second case, then you are going to have to do something like issue a unique token at each step of the process, and store the expected token on the server side.  Then when a request is made, check that there is a corresponding entry on the server side for the action that is being taken and that the expected tokens match and that that token has not been used yet.  If there is no, you reject the request, if there is, then you mark that token as used and process the request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If what you are concerned about is something other than one of these two scenarios then the answer will depend on more specifics than you have provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the basic database level you can track changes by having a separate table that gets an entry added to it via triggers on INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statements. Thats the general way of tracking changes to a database table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing you want is to know which &lt;em&gt;user&lt;/em&gt; made the change. Generally your triggers wouldn't know this. I'm assuming that if you want to know which user changed a piece of data then its possible that multiple users could change the same data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no right way to do this, you'll probably want to have a separate table that your application code will insert a record into whenever a user updates some data in the other table, including user, timestamp and id of the changed record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure to use a transaction so you don't end up with cases where update gets done without the insert, or if you do the opposite order you don't end up with insert without the update.&lt;/p&gt;

Auditing database table changes is the kind of operation that you'll typically want to log for all operations, so AOP can work very nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind that logging database changes will create lots of data and will slow the system down. It may be sensible to use a message-queue solution and a separate database to perform the audit log, depending on the size of the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's also perfectly feasible to use stored procedures to handle this, although there may be a bit of work involved passing user credentials through to the database itself.&lt;/p&gt;

Then you can show just what's changed, what's changed and what it changed from, or whatever you heart desires :)  Then you could write up a trigger to do the actual logging.  Not too painful if done properly...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter how you do it, though, it kind of depends on how your users connect to the database.  Are they using a single application user via a security context within the app, are they connecting using their own accounts on the domain, or does the app just have everyone connecting with a generic sql-account?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you aren't able to get the user info from the database connection, it's a little more of a pain.  And then you might look at doing the logging within the app, so if you have a process called "CreateOrder" or whatever, you can log to the Order_Audit table or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing it all within the app opens yourself up a little more to changes made from outside of the app, but if you have multiple apps all using the same data and you just wanted to see what changes were made by yours, maybe that's what you wanted... &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;shrug&lt;/em&gt;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

However only edges in a cycle are ever removed, therefor, for all edge between partitions to be removed, there needs to be a return path to complete the cycle. If we only consider edges between the partitions then the algorithm can at most remove the larger of each pair of edges, this can never remove the smallest bridging edge.

  &lt;p&gt;Symbols are loaded successfully. It shows the callstack, but double clicking on an entry doesn't bring me to the source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What version of VS are you using? (Or are you using Windbg?) ... in VS it should defintely prompt for source the first time if it doesn't find the location.  However it also keeps a list of source that was 'not found' so it doesn't ask you for it every time.  Sometimes the don't look list is a pain ... to get the prompt back up you need to go to solution explorer/solution node/properties/debug properties and edit the file list in the lower pane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally you might be using 'stripped symbols'.  These are pdb files generated to provide debug info for walking the callstack past FPO, but with source locations stripped out (along with other data).  The public symbols for windows OS components are stripped pdbs.  For your own code these simply cause pain and are not worth it unless you are providing your pdbs to externals. How would you have one of these horrible stripped pdbs?  You might have them if you use "binplace" with the -a command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;base case (input doesn't begin with '[') return the input
recursive case:
    split the input on ',' (you will need to find commas only at this level)
    for each sub string call this method again with the sub string
    return array containing the results from this recursive method
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only slighlty tricky part here is splitting the input on a single ','. You could write a separate function for this that would scan through the string and keep a count of the openbrackets - closedbrakets seen so far. Then only split on commas when the count is equal to zero.&lt;/p&gt;

To give customers a REST-ful service, I have to start talking to them about HTTP and XML, which they really don't understand as well as they think they do, and then I start getting a headache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, to be successful with REST, both the service provider and consumer have to know what they're doing (and they can keep things simple and come up with a great, non&amp;ndash;WS-* solution). With WS-* technologies, it can still succeed even if only one party has a clue. &lt;/p&gt;

Usually we know how we all felt since we're a small team but it's good to ask. Nothing gets written down, it's just done informally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meat of our meeting is what we call the Good, Bad, and Ugly (GBU). Good is obvious, it's the stuff we liked and we thought went well. Bad is stuff we could have done without but wasn't horrible. Ugly is ugly, it's stuff we wish we could forget or will have a big impact on the project. Sometimes it's hard to distinguish between Bad and Ugly but we try. We write down everything from all 3 of these sections of the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; sprint's retrospective, we go over what we wrote down for Bad or Ugly and see if it's gotten better or been fixed. Our Scrum Master is pretty good about getting things taken care of if needed so things rarely stay problems for long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on how we're feeling, sometimes we do Ugly first, then Bad and Good. This is only so we don't end on a bunch of downers by doing Ugly last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diana suggested adding Stage Setting and Data sections to the meeting to make sure we're all on the same page as far as what happened during the sprint before we go into the GBU. I'm going to try a timeline where everybody puts notes on what happened when during the sprint. I like that format since we do 4 week sprints and it's sometimes hard to keep track of what happened at what point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Versioning.&lt;/strong&gt; One advantage base classes have over interfaces is that you can easily add new virtual members in a later version, whereas adding members to an interface will break implementers built against the old version of the library. Instead, a new version of the interface with the new members needs to be created, and the library will have to work around or limit access to legacy objects only implementing the original interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a concrete example, the first version of a library might define an interface like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public interface INode {
  INode Root { get; }
  List&amp;lt;INode&amp;gt; GetChildren( );
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the library has released, we cannot modify the interface without breaking current users. Instead, in the next release we would need to define a new interface to add additional functionalty:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public interface IChildNode : INode {
  INode Parent { get; }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, only users of the new library will be able to implement the new interface. In order to work with legacy code, we need to adapt the old implementation, which an extension method can handle nicely:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public static class NodeExtensions {
  public INode GetParent( this INode node ) {
    // If the node implements the new interface, call it directly.
    var childNode = node as IChildNode;
    if( !object.ReferenceEquals( childNode, null ) )
      return childNode.Parent;

    // Otherwise, fall back on a default implementation.
    return FindParent( node, node.Root );
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now all users of the new library can treat both legacy and modern implementations identically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Overloads.&lt;/strong&gt; Another area where extension methods can be useful is in providing overloads for interface methods. You might have a method with several parameters to control its action, of which only the first one or two are important in the 90% case. Since C# does not allow setting default values for parameters, users either have to call the fully parameterized method every time, or every implementation must implement the trivial overloads for the core method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead extension methods can be used to provide the trivial overload implementations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public interface ILongMethod {
  public bool LongMethod( string s, double d, int i, object o, ... );
}

...
public static LongMethodExtensions {
  public bool LongMethod( this ILongMethod lm, string s, double d ) {
    lm.LongMethod( s, d, 0, null );
  }
  ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Please note that both of these cases are written in terms of the operations provided by the interfaces, and involve trivial or well-known default implementations. That said, you can only inherit from a class once, and the targeted use of extension methods can provide a valuable way to deal with some of the niceties provided by base classes that interfaces lack :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, an &lt;code&gt;NSError&lt;/code&gt; in the Cocoa domain that you get from a method in the Foundation framework will have its &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; property described in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Foundation/FoundationErrors.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; header.

This is a real problem for working software, and it's a difficult task. I have a working implementation but I'd like  to throw this out to SO and see what interesting ideas people can come up with, so that I can compare to my implementation and see how it stacks up. I've tried to be as specific to the requirements as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thread pool needs to execute a series of tasks. The tasks can be short running (&amp;lt;1sec) or long running (hours or days). Each task has an associated priority (from 1 = very low to 5 = very high). Tasks can arrive at any time while the other tasks are running, so as they arrive the thread pool needs to pick these up and schedule them as threads become available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task priority is completely independant of the task length. In fact it is impossible to tell how long a task could take to run without just running it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some tasks are CPU bound while some are greatly IO bound. It is impossible to tell beforehand what a given task would be (although I guess it might be possible to detect while the tasks are running).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary goal of the thread pool is to maximise throughput. The thread pool should effectively use the resources of the computer. Ideally, for CPU bound tasks, the number of active threads would be equal to the number of CPUs. For IO bound tasks, more threads should be allocated than there are CPUs so that blocking does not overly affect throughput. Minimising the use of locks and using thread safe/fast containers is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, you should run higher priority tasks with a higher CPU priority (ref: SetThreadPriority). Lower priority tasks should not "block" higher priority tasks from running, so if a higher priority task comes along while all low priority tasks are running, the higher priority task will get to run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tasks have a "max running tasks" parameter associated with them. Each type of task is only allowed to run at most this many concurrent instances of the task at a time. For example, we might have the following tasks in the queue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A - 1000 instances - low priority - max tasks 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B - 1000 instances - low priority - max tasks 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C - 1000 instances - low priority - max tasks 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A working implementation could only run (at most) 1 A, 1 B and 1 C at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It needs to run on Windows XP, Server 2003, Vista and Server 2008 (latest service packs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reference, we might use the following interface:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;namespace ThreadPool
{
    class Task
    {
    public:
     Task();  
     void run();

     void run(Task *inst);
     void stop();
    };
}

    function startsPlaying()

  &lt;p&gt;Recursive backtracker: This is somewhat related to the recursive backtracker solving method described below, and requires stack up to the size of the Maze. When carving, be as greedy as possible, and always carve into an unmade section if one is next to the current cell. Each time you move to a new cell, push the former cell on the stack. If there are no unmade cells next to the current position, pop the stack to the previous position. The Maze is done when you pop everything off the stack. This algorithm results in Mazes with about as high a "river" factor as possible, with fewer but longer dead ends, and usually a very long and twisty solution. It runs quite fast, although Prim's algorithm is a bit faster. Recursive backtracking doesn't work as a wall adder, because doing so tends to result in a solution path that follows the outside edge, where the entire interior of the Maze is attached to the boundary by a single stem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They produce only 10% dead ends&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/sample/recursiv.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is an example of a maze generated by that method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, be careful trying to wrap an &lt;code&gt;Enumeration&lt;/code&gt; as an &lt;code&gt;Iterable&lt;/code&gt;. If someone passes me an &lt;code&gt;Iterable&lt;/code&gt;, I will assume that I can call &lt;code&gt;iterator()&lt;/code&gt; on it repeatedly, creating as many &lt;code&gt;Iterator&lt;/code&gt; instances as I want, and iterating independently on each. A wrapped &lt;code&gt;Enumeration&lt;/code&gt; will not fulfill this contract; don't let your wrapped &lt;code&gt;Enumeration&lt;/code&gt; escape from your own code. (As an aside, I noticed that Java 7's &lt;a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/DirectoryStream.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;DirectoryStream&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; violates expectations in just this way, and shouldn't be allowed to "escape" either.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Enumeration&lt;/code&gt; is like an &lt;code&gt;Iterator&lt;/code&gt;, not an &lt;code&gt;Iterable&lt;/code&gt;. A &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;Iterable&lt;/code&gt;. An &lt;code&gt;Iterator&lt;/code&gt; is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can't do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Vector&amp;lt;X&amp;gt; list = 
Iterator&amp;lt;X&amp;gt; i = list.iterator();
for (X x : i) {
    x.doStuff();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it wouldn't make sense to do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Vector&amp;lt;X&amp;gt; list = 
Enumeration&amp;lt;X&amp;gt; i = list.enumeration();
for (X x : i) {
    x.doStuff();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no &lt;code&gt;Enumerable&lt;/code&gt; equivalent to &lt;code&gt;Iterable&lt;/code&gt;. It could be added without breaking anything to work in for loops, but what would be the point? If you are able to implement this new &lt;code&gt;Enumerable&lt;/code&gt; interface, why not just implement &lt;code&gt;Iterable&lt;/code&gt; instead?&lt;/p&gt;

REST vs. SOAP is really just the continuation of the debate of COM/CORBA vs. HTTP POST/GET etc.  SOAP is nothing more than an updated version of the same principles defined with C and C (contracts, providers, consumers etc.).  It's just that has appeared to SOAP succeed (at least partially) where the other two failed (and it could be that SOAP just has a better marketing team), that is that SOAP really does allow to different systems to connect rather easily compared to it's predecessors.  That being said, it still suffers from the same drawbacks that COM/CORBA did...it can get really complex.&lt;/p&gt;

It's REST and it's been around for years.  5 years from now people are going to look back and say the same thing about it being legacy and the need to change.  It's the nature of software development.  Everything goes in cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

There are a few reasons why QueueUserWorkItem and the Windows NT thread pool was ruled out (although the Vista one does look interesting, maybe in a few years).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we wanted to have greater control over when it starts up and stops threads. We have heard that the NT thread pool is reluctant to start up a new thread if it thinks that the tasks are short running. We could use the WT_EXECUTELONGFUNCTION, but we really have no idea if the task is long or short&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, if the thread pool was already filled up with long running, low priority tasks, there would be no chance of a high priority task getting to run in a timely manner. The NT thread pool has no real concept of task priorities, so we can't do a QueueUserWorkItem and say "oh by the way, run this one right away".&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;@DrPizza - this is a very good question, and one that strikes right to the heart of the problem. There are a few reasons why QueueUserWorkItem and the Windows NT thread pool was ruled out (although the Vista one does look interesting, maybe in a few years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it looks like it got quite beefed up in Vista, quite versatile now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, I'm still a bit unclear about how you wish the priorities to work.  If the pool is currently running a task of type A with maximal concurrency of 1 and low priority, and it gets given a new task also of type A (and maximal concurrency 1), but this time with a high priority, what should it do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suspending the currently executing A is hairy (it could hold a lock that the new task needs to take, deadlocking the system).  It can't spawn a second thread and just let it run alongside (the permitted concurrency is only 1).  But it can't wait until the low priority task is completed, because the runtime is unbounded and doing so would allow a low priority task to block a high priority task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My presumption is that it is the latter behaviour that you are after?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that is incorrect. In fact your query is strongly typed, it is just an anonymous type. I think the query you want is more like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var emps = from e in Employees
            join m in Employees
            on e.ManagerEmpID equals m.EmpID
            select new Employee
                      { e,
                        m.FullName
                      };
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which will return IEnumerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is &lt;a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/architecture/linqrepository.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; I wrote on the topic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linq-to-sql is an ORM. It does not affect the way that you design an N-tiered application. You use it the same way you would use any other ORM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For applications that stay offline and create multiple rows before saving, a common practice is to continue counting backwards (-2, -3, -4) for each new row's identity. Then when they're saved, the server can replace them with the true "next" value from the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there's any chance that you won't always be in control of the clients then I'd definately recommend DTOs, because as soon as you share your domain objects with someone else's client application you start tying your internals to someone else's dev cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've also found DTOs useful when working in a versioned service environment, which allowed us to radically change the internals of our app but still accept calls to the old versions of our service interfaces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you have a lot of client applications it might also be beneficial to use DTOs as you're then protected with an easily versionable service.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;OK, I'm still a bit unclear about how
  you wish the priorities to work. If
  the pool is currently running a task
  of type A with maximal concurrency of
  1 and low priority, and it gets given
  a new task also of type A (and maximal
  concurrency 1), but this time with a
  high priority, what should it do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is a bit of a tricky one, although in this case I think I would be happy with simply allowing the low-priority task to run to completion. Usually, we wouldn't see a lot of the same types of tasks with different thread priorities. In our model it is actually possible to safely halt and later restart tasks at certain well defined points (for different reasons than this) although the complications this would introduce probably aren't worth the risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, only different types of tasks would have different priorities. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A task - 1000 instances - low priority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B task - 1000 instances - high priority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming the A tasks had come along and were running, then the B tasks had arrived, we would want the B tasks to be able to run more or less straight away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outer joins will return records for the left side even if nothing exists for the right side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, you have an Orders and an OrderDetails table. They are related by an "OrderID".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OrderID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CustomerName&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OrderDetails&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OrderDetailID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OrderID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ProductName&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Qty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The request&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT Orders.OrderID, Orders.CustomerName FROM Orders 
INNER JOIN OrderDetails ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;will only return Orders that also have something in the OrderDetails table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you change it to OUTER LEFT JOIN&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT Orders.OrderID, Orders.CustomerName FROM Orders 
LEFT JOIN OrderDetails ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then it will return records from the Orders table even if they have no OrderDetails records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use this to find Orders that do not have any OrderDetails indicating a possible orphaned order by adding a where clause like &lt;code&gt;WHERE OrderDetails.OrderID IS NULL&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An inner join of A and B gives the result of A intersect B, i.e. the inner part of a venn diagram intersection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An outer join of A and B gives the results of A union B, i.e. the outer parts of a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram"&gt;Venn diagram&lt;/a&gt; union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have two tables, with a single column each, and data as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;A    B
-    -
1    3
2    4
3    5
4    6
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that (1,2) are unique to A, (3,4) are common, and (5,6) are unique to B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inner join&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An inner join using either of the equivalent queries gives the intersection of the two tables, i.e. the two rows they have in common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;select * from a INNER JOIN b on a.a = b.b;
select a.*,b.*  from a,b where a.a = b.b;

a | b
--+--
3 | 3
4 | 4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Left outer join&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A left outer join will give all rows in A, plus any common rows in B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;select * from a LEFT OUTER JOIN b on a.a = b.b;
select a.*,b.*  from a,b where a.a = b.b(+);

a |  b
--+-----
1 | null
2 | null
3 |    3
4 |    4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full outer join&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A full outer join will give you the union of A and B, i.e. all the rows in A and all the rows in B. If something in A doesn't have a corresponding datum in B, then the B portion is null, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;select * from a FULL OUTER JOIN b on a.a = b.b;

 a   |  b
-----+-----
   1 | null
   2 | null
   3 |    3
   4 |    4
null |    6
null |    5

  &lt;p&gt;What is your static memory manager actually doing? Unless it is doing something unsafe (P/Invoke, unsafe code), the behaviour you are seeing is a bug in your program, and not due to the behaviour of the CLR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in fact speaking about unsafe pointers. What I wanted was something like Marshal.AllocHGlobal, though with a lifetime exceeding a single method call. On reflection it seems that just using an index is the right solution as I might have gotten too caught up in mimicking the c++ code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One thing I would say from your post is that using structs may not help performance as you hope. C# fails to inline any method calls involving structs, and even though they've fixed this in their latest runtime beta, structs frequently don't perform that well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked into this a bit and I see it has been fixed in .NET 3.5SP1, I assume that's what you were refering to as the runtime beta. In fact, I now understand that this change accounted for a doubling of my rendering speed. Now, structs are agressively inlined, improving their performance greatly on X86 systems (X64 had better struct performance in advance).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PostgreSQL ODBC driver is &lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/odbc/versions/msi/"&gt;actively developed&lt;/a&gt; and an Access front-end combined with PostgreSQL server, in my opinion makes a great option on a LAN for rapid development. I have been involved in a reasonably big system (100+ PostgreSQL tables, 200+ Access forms, 1000+ Access queries &amp;amp; reports) and it has run excellently for a few years, with ~20 users. Any queries running slow because Access is doing something stupid can generally just be solved by using &lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/interactive/sql-createview.html"&gt;views&lt;/a&gt;, and any really data-intensive code can easily be moved into PostgreSQL functions and then called from Access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only main ODBC-related issue we have is that there is no way to kill a slow running query from Access, so we do often get users just killing Access and then massive queries are just left executing on the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing the data access portion of the code is fairly straightforward. It's testing out all the methods that work against the data that seem to be hard to test. For example, imagine a posting process where there is heavy data access to determine what is posted, numbers are adjusted, etc. There are a number of interim steps that occur (and need to be tested) along with tests afterwards that ensure the posting was successful. Some of those steps may actually be stored procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past I've tried inserting the test data in a test database, then running the test, but honestly it's pretty painful to write this kind of code (and error prone). I've also tried just building a test database up front and rolling back the changes. That works OK but in a number of places you can't easily do this either (and many people would say that's integration testing; so be it, I still need to be able to test this somehow).&lt;/p&gt;

The DropDownList control contains the standard info city, state, county etc... info.
In addition to the standard codes the site also has custom codes that the users can configure themselves.
For example a animal dropdown may contain the values Dog, Cat, Fish, ect...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am popluating the DropDownList from a SQL 2005 table that I created e.g. tblCodes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything works great and users are able to add orders using the numerous DropDownList controls to choose items from the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem occurrs if a user wants to change one of their custom dropdowns. For example a user would like to change the verbage
on a animal type control from Dog to K9. This is where the problem starts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all new orders the drop down works fine. When the user retrieved an old order
I get the following error in the C# codebehind
"'DropDownList1' has a SelectedValue which is invalid because it does not exist in the list of items."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's happening is the old order has a database field value of Dog and the DropDownList no longer has Dog in its list since the user changed it to K9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to make the units being tested as small and discrete as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to make tests independant.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a very detailed post about integration testing your data access layer &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12374/has-anyone-had-any-success-in-unit-testing-sql-stored-procedures#25204" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I show not only the sample data access class, base class, and sample DB transaction fixture class, but a full CRUD integration test w/ sample data shown.  With this approach you don't need multiple test databases as you can control the data going in with each test and after the test is complete the transactions are all rolledback so your DB is clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About unit testing business logic inside your app, I would also second the comments by @Phil and @Mark because if you mock out all the dependencies your business object has, it becomes very simple to test your application logic one entity at a time ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit:  So are you looking for one huge integration test that will verify everything from logic pre-data base / stored procedure run w/ logic and finally a verification on the way back?  If so you could break this out into 2 steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 - Unit test the logic that happens before the data is pushed
into your data access code.  For
example, if you have some code that
calculates some numbers based on
some properties -- write a test that
only checks to see if the logic for
this 1 function does what you asked
it to do.  Mock out any dependancy
on the data access class so you can
ignore it for this test of the
application logic alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 - Integration test the logic that happens once you take your
    manipulated data (from the previous
    method we unit tested) and call the
    appropriate stored procedure.  Do
    this inside a data specific testing
    class so you can rollback after it's
    completed.  After your stored
    procedure has run, do a query
    against the database to get your
    object now that we have done some
    logic against the data and verify it
    has the values you expected
    (post-stored procedure logic /etc )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need an entry in your database for the stored procedure to run, simply insert that data before you run the sproc that has your logic inside it.  For example, if you have a product that you need to test, it might require a supplier and category entry to insert so before you insert your product do a quick and dirty insert for a supplier and category so your product insert works as planned.&lt;/p&gt;

I say this NOT prematurely, as it was my first response to see where I had messed up in my code. When I add controls to the page I can't reference all of them in the code behind. Some of them I can, it seems that the first few I put on a page work, then it just stops. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first thought it may be the type of control as initially I was trying to reference a repeater inside an update panel. I know I am correctly referencing the code behind in my aspx page. But just in case it was a  screw up on my part I started to recreate the page from scratch and this time got a few more controls down before VS stopped recognizing my controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After creating my page twice and getting stuck I thought maybe it was still the type of controls. I created a new page and just threw some labels on it. No dice, build fails when referencing the control from the code behind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a possibly unrelated note when I switch to the dreaded "design" mode of the aspx pages VS 2008 errors out and restarts. &lt;/p&gt;

Server returns a page that starts with the requested answer, and puts the id of the first answer on the next page into next page link. There must be a way to write SQL for that, right? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it how it usually done? Or there is a better way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database Connected Tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mock Persistence Layer Tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Database Connected Tests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I have automated tests that are connected to the database, I usually make a single test database template that has enough data for all the tests.  When the automated tests are run, a new test database is generated from the template for every test.  The test database has to be constantly re-generated because test will often change the data.  As tests are added, I usually append more data to the test database template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some nice advantages to this testing method.  The obvious advantage is that the tests also exercise your schema.  Another advantage is that after setting up the initial tests, most new tests will be able to re-use the existing test data.  This makes it easy to add more tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside is that the test database will become unwieldy.  Because data will usually be added one test at time, it will be inconsistent and maybe even unrealistic.  You will also end up cursing the person who setup the test database when there is a significant database schema change (which for me usually means I end up cursing myself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This style of testing obviously doesn't work if you can't generate new test databases at will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mock Persistence Layer Tests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this pattern, you create &lt;a href="http://www.mockobjects.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;mock objects&lt;/a&gt; that live with the test cases.  These mock objects intercept the calls to the database so that you can programmatically provide the appropriate results.  Basically, when the code you're testing calls the &lt;code&gt;findCustomerByName()&lt;/code&gt; method, your mock object is called instead of the persistence layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about using mock object tests is that you can get very specific.  Often times, there are execution paths that you simply can't reach in automated tests w/o mock objects.  They also free you from maintaining a large, monolithic set of test data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another benefit is the lack of external dependencies.  Because the mock objects simulate the persistence layer, your tests are no longer dependent on the database.  This is often the deciding factor when choosing which pattern to choose.  Mock objects seem to get more traction when dealing with legacy database systems or databases with stringent licensing terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside of mock objects is that they often result in a lot of extra test code.  This isn't horrible because almost any amount of testing code is cheap when amortized over the number of times you run the test, but it can be annoying to have more test code then production code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In perl, I kind of grit my teeth and let $opt_v be (effectively) a global. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In ruby,the more-or-less exact equivalent would be &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;require 'optparse'
    opts.on("-v", "--[no-]verbose", TrueClass, "Run verbosely") {
        |$opt_verbose|
    }
    opts.parse!
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where $opt_verbose is a global that classes could access. Having classes know about global flags like that seems ... er ... wrong. What's the OO-idiomatic way of doing this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let the main routine take care of all option-related stuff and have the classes just return things to it that it decides how to deal with?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have classes implement optional behaviour (e.g., know how to be verbose) and set a mode via an attr_writer sort of thing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;updated:&lt;/em&gt; Thanks for the answers suggesting optparse, but I should have been clearer that it's not &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to process command-line options I'm asking about, but more the relationship between command-line options that effectively set a global program state and classes that should ideally be independent of that sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way I'd really consider it is using the datacontext to fetch data, then fill an intermediary data model, passing that through, and referencing it on both sides, and using that in your client side - then passing them back and pushing the data back into a new Datacontext or intellgently updating rows after you refetch them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Scope&lt;/strong&gt; (were deliverables clear, management of scope changes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Schedule&lt;/strong&gt; (actual vs planned completion dates, was schedule realistic and clear?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Costs&lt;/strong&gt; (approved vs actual, capital vs expense, management of budget changes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Quality&lt;/strong&gt; (was the appropriate level specified and met, was there an appropriate quality plan?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Communication&lt;/strong&gt; (was there an agreed plan?, examine major stakeholder groups and how they were communicated with, any missed stakeholders?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Staffing&lt;/strong&gt; (were roles/responsibilities clear, sufficient resources?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Risk&lt;/strong&gt; (Risk Management Plan?, Risk Register (with mitigation), Risk Reviews?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Procurement Management&lt;/strong&gt; (was there a plan?, make or buy analyzed?, seller evaluation?, appropriate contracts opened and closed?)&lt;/p&gt;

The pointer is a lightweight yet powerful mechanism that gives you immense freedom at the cost of immense capacity to shoot yourself in the foot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In C the responsibility of ensuring your pointers point to memory you own is yours and yours alone. This requires an organized and disciplined approach, unless you forsake pointers, which makes it hard to write effective C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The posted answers to date concentrate on automatic (stack) and heap variable allocations. Using stack allocation does make for automatically managed and convenient memory, but in some circumstances (large buffers, recursive algorithms) it can lead to the horrendous problem of stack overflow. Knowing exactly how much memory you can allocate on the stack is very dependent on the system. In some embedded scenarios a few dozen bytes might be your limit, in some desktop scenarios you can safely use megabytes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heap allocation is less inherent to the language. It is basically a set of library calls that grants you ownership of a block of memory of given size until you are ready to return ('free') it. It sounds simple, but is associated with untold programmer grief. The problems are simple (freeing the same memory twice, or not at all [memory leaks], not allocating enough memory [buffer overflow], etc)  but difficult to avoid and debug. A hightly disciplined approach is absolutely mandatory in practive but of course the language doesn't actually mandate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd like to mention another type of memory allocation that's been ignored by other posts. It's possible to statically allocate variables by declaring them outside any function. I think in general this type of allocation gets a bad rap because it's used by global variables. However there's nothing that says the only way to use memory allocated this way is as an undisciplined global variable in a mess of spaghetti code. The static allocation method can be used simply to avoid some of the pitfalls of the heap and automatic allocation methods. Some C programmers are surprised to learn that large and sophisticated C embedded and games programs have been constructed with no use of heap allocation at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer your question, go with the first approach. One less table to store reduces space and will make your queries use less JOIN commands. Also, and more importantly, it correctly matches your desired input. The database schema should describe the format for all valid data - if it fits the format it should be considered valid. Since a user can only have one company it's possible to have incorrect data in your database if you use the second schema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one implies that a User can only be a member of &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; company (a belongs_to relationship). Whereas the second schema implies that a User can be a member of many companies (a has_many relationship)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a schema that can (or will later) support a has_many relationship then you want to go with the second one. For the reason compare:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
//select all users in company x with schema 1
select username, companyname from companies
inner join users on users.companyid = companies.companyid
where companies.companyid = __some_id__;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
//select all users in company x with schema 2
select username, companyname from companies
inner join usercompanies on usercompanies.companyid = companies.companyid
inner join users on usercompanies.userid = users.userid
where companies.companyid = __some_id__;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have an extra join on the select table. If you only want the belongs_to relationship then the second query does more work than it should - and so makes it less efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's assume the hierachy is mostly read, but isn't completely static.  Let's say it's a family tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's how not to do it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;create table person (
person_id integer autoincrement primary key,
name      varchar(255) not null,
dob       date,
mother    integer,
father    integer
);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And inserting data like this:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;person_id   name      dob       mother father  
1           Pops      1900/1/1   null   null  
2           Grandma   1903/2/4   null   null  
3           Dad       1925/4/2   2      1  
4           Uncle Kev 1927/3/3   2      1
5           Cuz Dave  1953/7/8   null   4
6           Billy     1954/8/1   null   3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, split your nodes and your relationships into two tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;create table person (
person_id integer autoincrement primary key,
name      varchar(255) not null,
dob       date
);

create table ancestor (
ancestor_id   integer,
descendant_id integer,
distance      integer
);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data is created like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;person_id   name      dob       
1           Pops      1900/1/1  
2           Grandma   1903/2/4   
3           Dad       1925/4/2   
4           Uncle Kev 1927/3/3
5           Cuz Dave  1953/7/8   
6           Billy     1954/8/1   

ancestor_id  descendant_id  distance
1            1              0
2            2              0
3            3              0
4            4              0
5            5              0
6            6              0
1            3              1
2            3              1
1            4              1
2            4              1
1            5              2
2            5              2
4            5              1
1            6              2
2            6              2
3            6              1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you can now run arbitary queries that don't involve joining the table back on itself, which would happen if you have the heirachy relationship in the same row as the node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who has grandparents?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;select * from person where person_id in 
    (select descendant_id from ancestor where distance=2);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All your descendants:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;select * from person where person_id in 
    (select descendant_id from ancestor 
    where ancestor_id=1 and distance&amp;gt;0);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who are uncles? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;select decendant_id uncle from ancestor 
    where distance=1 and ancestor_id in 
    (select ancestor_id from ancestor 
        where distance=2 and not exists
        (select ancestor_id from ancestor 
        where distance=1 and ancestor_id=uncle)
    )
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You avoid all the problems of joining a table to itself via subqueries, a common limitation is 16 subsuqeries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trouble is, maintaining the ancestor table is kind of hard - best done with a stored procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if it is always in a block of the same size (say 64 bytes) then change your malloc/free pair to always allocate 64 byte chunks in their own page.  When you free a 64 byte chunk then set the memory protection bits on that page to prevent reads and wites (using VirtualQuery).  Then anyone attempting to access this memory will generate an exception rather than corrupting the heap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does assume that the number of outstanding 64 byte chunks is only moderate or you have a lot of memory to burn in the box!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To me, a catch (Exception) clause should've captured any exception whatsoever. Is there any reason why it wouldn't?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only possibility I can think of is that something else is catching it before you and handling it in a way that appears to be an uncaught exception (e.g. exiting the process).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;my try/catch block won't catch it and instead stops execution as an unhandled exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to find what is causing the exit process.  It might be something other than an unhandled exception.
You might try using the native debugger with a breakpoint set on "{,,kernel32.dll}ExitProcess".  Then use SOS to determine what managed code is calling exit process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think your biggest obstacle is gonna be converting one wiki markup to another. For example, some wikis use markdown (which is what Stack Overflow uses), others use another markup syntax (e.g. BBCode, ...), etc.. The bottom line is - assuming the contents are databased it's not impossible to export and parse it to make it "fit" in another system. It might just be a pain in the ass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if the contents are not databased, it's gonna be a royal pain in the ass. :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another solution would be to stay with the same system. I am not sure what the reason is for changing the technology later on. It's not like a growing project requires IIS/ASP.NET all of the sudden. (It might just be the other way around.) But for example, if you could stick with PHP for a while, you could also run that on IIS.&lt;/p&gt;

                 d =&amp;gt; [ e =&amp;gt; [], f =&amp;gt; [] ] ] ];
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, the tree's representation is as nested pairs: first the element (in this case, the letter), then an anonymous array reference representing the children of that element. Note that &lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is just a fancy comma in Perl that exempts you having to put quotes around the the token to the left of the comma, provided it is a single word. The above code could also have been written thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$tree = [ 't', [ 'a' , [ 'b' , [], 'c' , [] ]
                 'd' , [ 'e' , [], 'f' , [] ] ] ];
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a simple depth-first accumulator of all the elements in the tree:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sub elements {
    my $tree = shift;

    my @elements;
    my @queue = @$tree;
    while (@queue) {
        my $element  = shift @queue;
        my $children = shift @queue;
        push @elements, $element;
        unshift @queue, @$children;
    }

    return @elements;
}

@elements = elements($tree)     # qw(t a b c d e f)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(For breadth first, change the line &lt;code&gt;unshift @queue, @$children&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;push @queue, @$children&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, depending on what operations you want to perform on your tree, the simplest thing might be just to use Perl's built-in support for arrays and array references.&lt;/p&gt;

A windows PC with a LAN interface and a WiFi interface (the standard for any new laptop). Each of the interfaces might be connected or disconnected from a network. I need a way to determine which one of the adapters is the one connected to the internet - specifically, in case they are both connected to different networks, one with connection to the internet and one without.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current solution involves using IPHelper's "GetBestInterface" function and supplying it with the IP address "0.0.0.0".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have any other solutions you might suggest to this problem?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following some of the answers, let me elaborate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need this because I have a product that has to choose which adapter to bind to. I have no way of controlling the setup of the network or the host where the product will run and so I need a solution that is as robust as possible, with as few assumptions as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need to do this in code, since this is part of a product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Chris Upchurch: This makes me dependent on google.com being up (usually not a problem) and on any personal firewall that might be installed to allow pinging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Till: Like Steve Moon said, relying on the adapter's address is kind of risky because you make a lot of assumptions on the internal network setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Steve Moon: Looking at the routing table sounds like a good idea, but instead of applying the routing logic myself, I am trying to use "GetBestInterface" as described above. I believe what it should do is exactly what you outlined in your answer, but I am not really sure. The reason I'm reluctant to implement my own "routing logic" is that there's a better chance that I'll get it wrong than if I use a library/API written and tested by more "hard-core" network people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prepare a timeline of events for your phase and circulate before the meeting.  Review it briefly to start the meeting to make sure nothing major was left out.  This helps people remember and frames the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep the bulk of the meeting simple.  Do the "what went right/what went wrong".  Although ending on the "right" seems like it will make people feel better at the end of the meeting, resist the urge!  Studies show that the right-first/wrong-last structure is better at eliciting the right information.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't try to solve any issues in the meeting.  However, do try to parse what are root causes versus symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pick a consensus top 5 issues to resolve for next time.  Assign ownership (this is the most important step, or nothing will get done).  Next time around review the issues you were supposed to have resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep the meetings on the order of an hour long.  If you have a large group (more than 15-20 people), consider splitting into multiple sessions.  Anonymous questionnaires are good for those who may not be able to attend, are shy, or fear repercussions.  That said, if you're managing this, make sure you don't shoot the messenger--you're going to get opinions, and all opinions are valid.  That doesn't mean you have to give each opinion equal standing, but do look for trends that show a decline in morale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;UserWidgets1: UserWidgetID (PK), WidgetID (FK), UserID (FK)  &lt;/li&gt;

However, this seems unnecessary since the only data being stored in the table is the relationship between the two primary tables, and this relationship itself can form a unique key. Thus leading to option 2, which has a two-column primary key, but loses the one-column unique identifier that option 1 has. I could also optionally add a two-column unique index (WidgetID, UserID) to the first table.&lt;/p&gt;

Generally, unless you're routing between the networks in windows (which is possible, but unusual for a client computer these days) the interface that holds the default route is going to have the Internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your question didn't detail why or what you're doing this with so I can't provide any specifics. The command line tool "route" may be of some help, but there are probably libraries for whatever programming language you're using to look at the routing table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can't rely on the IP address of the interface (e.g., assuming an RFC-1918 address [192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/12, 10.0.0.0/8] isn't the internet) since most sites have some kind of NATed firewall or proxy setup and the "internet" interface is really on a "private" lan that gets you out to the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Based on your further information, it sounds like you have a decent solution. I'm not so sure about the choice of 0.0.0.0 since that's a boundary case for IP address -- might be OK on your particular mix of platform/language. Sounds (from the API description) like you could just specify an address, so why not some address known to be on the Internet, e.g. the IP address of your web site, or something more random like 65.66.67.68? Just make sure not to pick one of the rfc-1918 addresses, or the localhost range (127.0.0.0/8), or multicast, any other reserved range, and any address that resolves to a .mil or .gov (while it doesn't sound like getbestinterface sends any traffic, it would suck to find out by having the feds break your door down... :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want uniqueness then use either the compound key (UserWidgets2) or a uniqueness constraint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usual performance advantage of having a primary key is that you often query the table by the primary key, which is fast. In the case of many-to-many tables you don't usually query by the primary key so there is no performance benefit. Many-to-many tables are queried by their foreign keys, so you should consider adding indexes on WidgetID and UserID.&lt;/p&gt;

It is not a copy left license and it addresses several matters that are important to established companies and their lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copy left is the philosophy of the free software foundation requiring anything incorporating the licensed opens source code to also be licensed as open source.  That philosophy is regarded as poison by established companies that want to keep their products proprietary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from not having copy left provisions, the Apache license specifically addresses the grant of rights from project contributors and it expressly addresses the fact that modern companies are typically made up for more than one legal entity (for example, a parent company and its subsidiaries).  Most open source licenses dont address these points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever license you choose, if you want your code to be corporate friendly, in the sense that you want it to be incorporated into commercial, non-open source products, it is essential that you avoid GPL and other copy left type licenses.  While it would be best to consult with your own lawyer before investing time or money in a project for which this is an important factor, a quick shorthand for licenses that are and are not copy left can be found on the Free Software Foundations website.  They identify which licenses they dont find meet their standards as copy left.  The ones FSF rejects are most likely the ones that will be corporate friendly in this sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Although the question didnt ask this, it is worth mentioning that, with very few exceptions, even GPL and other copy left type licenses are perfectly corporate friendly if they are only used internally by the commercial entities and not incorporated into their products.)&lt;/p&gt;

It's relying on undocumented internal implementation details of the admin, is likely to break again in future versions of Django, and is no easier to implement than just finding another JS calendar widget and using that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, here's what you have to do if you're determined to make this work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Define your own ModelForm subclass for your model (best to put it in forms.py in your app), and tell it to use the AdminDateWidget / AdminTimeWidget / AdminSplitDateTime (replace 'mydate' etc with the proper field names from your model):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;from django import forms
from my_app.models import Product
from django.contrib.admin import widgets                                       

class ProductForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Product
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(ProductForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.fields['mydate'].widget = widgets.AdminDateWidget()
        self.fields['mytime'].widget = widgets.AdminTimeWidget()
        self.fields['mydatetime'].widget = widgets.AdminSplitDateTime()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change your URLconf to pass 'form_class': ProductForm instead of 'model': Product to the generic create_object view (that'll mean "from my_app.forms import ProductForm" instead of "from my_app.models import Product", of course).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the head of your template, include {{ form.media }} to output the links to the Javascript files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the hacky part: the admin date/time widgets presume that the i18n JS stuff has been loaded, and also require core.js, but don't provide either one automatically.  So in your template above {{ form.media }} you'll need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script type="text/javascript" src="/my_admin/jsi18n/"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script type="text/javascript" src="/media/admin/js/core.js"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may also wish to use the following admin CSS (thanks &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38601/using-django-time-date-widgets-in-custom-form/719583#719583"&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt; for mentioning this):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/media/admin/css/forms.css"/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/media/admin/css/base.css"/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/media/admin/css/global.css"/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/media/admin/css/widgets.css"/&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This implies that Django's admin media (ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX) is at /media/admin/ - you can change that for your setup.  Ideally you'd use a context processor to pass this values to your template instead of hardcoding it, but that's beyond the scope of this question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also requires that the URL /my_admin/jsi18n/ be manually wired up to the django.views.i18n.javascript_catalog view (or null_javascript_catalog if you aren't using I18N).  You have to do this yourself instead of going through the admin application so it's accessible regardless of whether you're logged into the admin (thanks &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38601/using-django-time-date-widgets-in-custom-form/408230#408230"&gt;Jeremy&lt;/a&gt; for pointing this out).  Sample code for your URLconf:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(r'^my_admin/jsi18n', 'django.views.i18n.javascript_catalog'),
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, if you are using Django 1.2 or later, you need some additional code in your template to help the widgets find their media:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{% load adminmedia %} /* At the top of the template. */

/* In the head section of the template. */
&amp;lt;script type="text/javascript"&amp;gt;
window.__admin_media_prefix__ = "{% filter escapejs %}{% admin_media_prefix %}{% endfilter %}";
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surrogate numeric key columns are not 'primary keys'. Primary keys are technically one of the combination of columns that uniquely identify a record within a table. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone building a database should read this article &lt;a href="http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/database-soup/primary-keyvil-part-i-7327" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/database-soup/primary-keyvil-part-i-7327&lt;/a&gt; by Josh Berkus to understand the difference between surrogate numeric key columns and primary keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience the only real reason to add a surrogate numeric key to your table is if your primary key is a compound key and needs to be used as a foreign key reference in another table. Only then should you even think to add an extra column to the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever I see a database structure where every table has an 'id' column the chances are it has been designed by someone who doesn't appreciate the relational model and it will invariably display one or more of the problems identified in Josh's article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In IIS, SMTP is running. Under "Access" tab, "Relay" button, the Select which computers may relay through this virtual server is set to checkbox "only the list below" and on the list is "127.0.0.1(xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)" (x's representing actual server IP address).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Server is running Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2, fully patched as of 5 PM Sept 1st 2008. I assume it is running IIS7 (how to check?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reponse to &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/2257/espo" rel="nofollow"&gt;Espo&lt;/a&gt;: This machine is hosted at a datacenter. We do not want to use a gmail account (were doing it, want to move away from that). Windows server 2003 comes with its own SMTP server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: Per Yaakov Ellis' advice, I dropped all relay restrictions and added the server  IP to the allowed list (using the reverse DNS button provided) and the thing started working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to both Espo and Yaakov for helping me out.&lt;/p&gt;

If you business is developing web-applications it is almost always best to stick with what you do, and let other people do their stuff (eg running mailservers).&lt;/p&gt;

That KB-article says it is for exchange, but the same commands are used for other SMTP-servers (including IIS) as well, so please try and see if you can send mails using the examples from the article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first solution, images in database, is somewhat "cleaner" as your data access layer will have to deal only with database objects; but this is good only when you have to deal with low numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously database access performance when you deal with binary large objects is degrading, and the database dimensions will grow a lot, causing again performance loss... and normally database space is much more expensive than file system space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand having large binary objects stored in file system will cause you to have backup plans that have to consider both database and file system, and this can be an issue for some systems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason to go for file system is when you have to share your images data (or sounds, video, whatever) with third party access: in this days I'm developing a web app that uses images that have to be accessed from "outside" my web farm in such a way that a database access to retrieve binary data is simply impossible. So sometimes there are also design considerations that will drive you to a choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider also, when making this choice, if you have to deal with permission and authentication when accessing binary objects: these requisites normally can be solved in an easier way when data are stored in db.&lt;/p&gt;

I ran up against this too. My solution was to represent the desired inheritance through interfaces rather than the entity beans themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your case, you could define the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public interface Problem {
    public Person getPerson();
}

public interface UglyProblem extends Problem {
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then implement these interfaces using an abstract superclass and two entity subclasses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;@MappedSuperclass
public abstract class AbstractProblemImpl implements Problem {
    @ManyToOne
    private Person person;

    public Person getPerson() {
        return person;
    }
}

@Entity
public class ProblemImpl extends AbstractProblemImpl implements Problem {
}

@Entity
public class UglyProblemImpl extends AbstractProblemImpl implements UglyProblem {
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an added benefit, if you code using the interfaces rather than the actual entity beans that implement those interfaces, it makes it easier to change the underlying mappings later on (less risk of breaking compatibility).&lt;/p&gt;

In order to test these classes you need to create a unit test class for each of the classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets go with a smarter route instead; if your goal is to &lt;strong&gt;avoid code and test code duplication&lt;/strong&gt; you might want to create an abstract class instead that handles the &lt;strong&gt;recurring&lt;/strong&gt; code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g. you have the following interface:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public interface IFoo {

    public void CommonCode();

    public void SpecificCode();

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might want to create an abstract class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public abstract class AbstractFoo : IFoo {

    public void CommonCode() {
          SpecificCode();
    }

    public abstract void SpecificCode();

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing that is easy; implement the abstract class in the test class either as an inner class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[TextFixture]
public void TestClass {

    private class TestFoo : AbstractFoo {
        boolean hasCalledSpecificCode = false;
        public void SpecificCode() {
            hasCalledSpecificCode = true;
        }
    }

    [Test]
    public void testCommonCallsSpecificCode() {
        TestFoo fooFighter = new TestFoo();
        fooFighter.CommonCode();
        Assert.That(fooFighter.hasCalledSpecificCode, Is.True());
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...or let the test class extend the abstract class itself if that fits your fancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[TestFixture]
public void TestClass : AbstractFoo {

    boolean hasCalledSpecificCode;
    public void specificCode() {
        hasCalledSpecificCode = true;
    }

    [Test]
    public void testCommonCallsSpecificCode() {
        AbstractFoo fooFighter = this;
        hasCalledSpecificCode = false;
        fooFighter.CommonCode();
        Assert.That(fooFighter.hasCalledSpecificCode, Is.True());
    }        

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having an abstract class take care of common code that an interface implies gives a much cleaner code design. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this makes sense to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note, this is a common design pattern called the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern" rel="nofollow"&gt;Template Method pattern&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. In the above example, the template method is the &lt;code&gt;CommonCode&lt;/code&gt; method and &lt;code&gt;SpecificCode&lt;/code&gt; is called a stub or a hook. The idea is that anyone can extend behavior without the need to know the behind the scenes stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of frameworks rely on this behavioral pattern, e.g. &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178472.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;ASP.NET&lt;/a&gt; where you have to implement the hooks in a page or a user controls such as the generated &lt;code&gt;Page_Load&lt;/code&gt; method which is called by the &lt;code&gt;Load&lt;/code&gt; event, the template method calls the hooks behind the scenes. There are a lot more examples of this. Basically anything that you have to implement that is using the words "load", "init", or "render" is called by a template method.&lt;/p&gt;

However don't use a blacklist for &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; characters, but a whitelist for allowed characters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$page = preg_replace('[^a-zA-Z0-9]', '', $page);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... followed by a file_exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That way you can make sure that only scripts you want to be executed are executed (for example this would rule out a "blabla.inc.php", because "." is not allowed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: This is kind of a "hack", because then the user could execute "h.o.m.e" and it would give the "home" page, because all it does is removing all prohibited characters. It's not intended to stop "smartasses" who want to cute stuff with your page, but it will stop people doing &lt;em&gt;really bad&lt;/em&gt; things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW: Another thing you could do in you &lt;strong&gt;.htaccess&lt;/strong&gt; file is to prevent obvious attack attempts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} http[:%] [NC]
RewriteRule .* /http [F,NC]
RewriteRule http: /http [F,NC]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That way all page accesses with "http:" url (and query string) result in an "Forbidden" error message, not even reaching the php script. That results in less server load. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simple truth is that an interface is nothing more than a contract that a method is implemented. It is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a contract on either a.) how the method should be implemented and b.) what that method should be doing exactly (it only guarantees the return type), the two reasons that I glean would be your motive in wanting this kind of test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you really want to be in control of your method implementation, you have the option of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementing it as a method in an abstract class, and inherit from that. You will still need to inherit it into a concrete class, but you are sure that unless it is explicitly overriden that method will do that correct thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In .NET 3.5/C# 3.0, implementing the method as an extension method referencing to the Interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public static ReturnType MethodName (this IMyinterface myImplementation, SomeObject someParameter)
{
    //method body goes here
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any implementation properly referencing to that extension method will emit precisely that extension method so you only need to test it once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works this way -- your system accepts a user's address via an online form. Your form hands off the user's address to the third-party address standardization web service. The web service gives you back the same address but now with the data standardized into discrete address fields, and with the standard abbreviations and formats applied. Your application displays this standardized address to your user for their confirmation before attempting to save the data in your DB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all the user addresses go through a standardization step and only standardized addresses are saved to your DB, then finding duplicate records should be greatly simplified since you are now comparing apples to apples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One such third-party service is &lt;a href="http://www.globaladdress.net/?pn=globaladdressinteractive" rel="nofollow"&gt;Global Address's Interactive Service&lt;/a&gt; which includes Germany in the list of supported countries, and also has an online demo that demonstrates how their service works (demo link can be found on that web page).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a cost disadvantage to this approach, obviously. However, on the plus side:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you would not need to create and maintain your own address standardization metadata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you won't need to continuously enhance your address standardization routines, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you're free to focus your software development energy on the parts of the application that are unique to your requirements &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to update to a specific version, you must install it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;gem install &amp;lt;gemname&amp;gt; -v &amp;lt;gemversion&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can leave out the -v options. Rubygems then installs the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;How to help yourself&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two useful gem commands to remember are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;gem help
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shows how to get help with rubygems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;gem help commands
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shows all commands available to rubygems.
From here you can get more specific help on a command by using gem help:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;gem help update
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

For simplicity, my setup script installs the database file in the same directory as the code which accesses the database (on Unix, something like /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/mypackage/).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I store the final location of the database file so my code can access it?  Right now, I'm using a hack based on the &lt;code&gt;__file__&lt;/code&gt; variable in the module which accesses the database:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
dbname = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "database.dat")
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works, but it seems... hackish.  Is there a better way to do this?  I'd like to have the setup script just grab the final installation location from the distutils module and stuff it into a "dbconfig.py" file that gets installed alongside the code that accesses the database.&lt;/p&gt;

The real benefits of Direct3D are that it has a regular release schedule - it's always being updated to take advantage of the latest advances in graphics hardware. How long has it taken between the OpenGL 2.0 and 3.0 releases? Also, a lot of work has been done in extensions for OpenGL, which means only some rendering will work on some cards.&lt;/p&gt;

You can not link in a dll during compilation.
I don't know if there is some subtle way to do this, but you would probably have to distribute the dlls along with your cms.

&lt;p&gt;OK, one obvious option is to provide a serializable object local to the datasource that uses it but doesn't have the datasource as part of its serializable object graph. The fat client could then look up that object and query it instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or create a (web?) service through which to access the datasource is governed - again your fat client would hit the service - this would probably be better encapsulated and more reuseable approach if those are concerns for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://github.com/wspr/pstool/tree/master" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://github.com/wspr/pstool/tree/master&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The package itself is derived from a single file (in this case, pstool.tex) which, when processed, produces the documentation, the readme, the installer file, and the actual files that make up the package as it is used by LaTeX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to make it easy for users who want to download this stuff, I include all of the derived files mentioned above in the repository itself as well as the master file pstool.tex. This means that I'll have double the number of changes every time I commit because the package file pstool.sty is a generated subset of the master file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's really the crux of the matter in this case. Yes, released versions of the package can be obtained from elsewhere. So it does really make more sense to only version the non-generated files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the convenience, which is real and repeated, outweighs cost, which is borne behind the scenes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is also rather pertinent in that if a user finds a bug and I fix it immediately, they can then head over to the repository and grab the file that's necessary for them to continue working without having to run any "installation" steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this, I think, is the more important use case &lt;em&gt;for my particular set of projects&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using XHTML makes automated error detection easy, every change can be automatically checked for invalid markup. This prevents errors, especially when using automatically generated content. It is really easy for a web developer using a templating engine (JSP, ASP.NET StringTemplate, etcetera) to copy/paste one closing tag too little or too many. When this is your only error, it can be detected and fixed immediately. I once worked for a site that had 165 validation errors per page, of which 2 or 3 were actual bugs. These were hard to find in the clutter of other errors. Automatic validation would have prevented these errors at the source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, choosing a standard and sticking to it can never benefit interoperability with other systems (screen scrapers, screen readers, search engines) and I have never come across a situation where a valid semantic XHTML with CSS solution wasn't possible for all major browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, when working with complex systems, it's not always possible to stick to your doctype, but this is mostly a result of improper communication between the different teams developing different parts of these systems, or, most likely, legacy systems. In the last case it's probably better to isolate these cases and change your doctype accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's good to be pragmatic and not adhere to XHTML just because someone said so, regardless of costs, but with current knowledge about CSS and browsers, testing and validation tools, most of the time the benefits are much greater than the costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a linked file to each individual project/class library. There will be only one copy and every project will have a reference to the code via a linked file at compile time. Its a very elegant solution to solve shared non public resources without duplicating code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Compile Include="path to shared file usually relative"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;Link&amp;gt;filename for Visual Studio To Dispaly.resx&amp;lt;/Link&amp;gt;

&lt;p&gt;add that code to the complile item group of a csproj file then replace the paths with your actual paths to the resx files and you sould be able to open them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have done this for one project file you should be able to employ the copy &amp;amp; paste the linked file to other projects without having to hack the csproj.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Which will return IEnumerable. ... Linq-to-sql is an ORM. It does not affect the way that you design an N-tiered application. You use it the same way you would use any other ORM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I guess I am still confused.  Yes, Linq-to-Sql is an ORM; but as far as I can tell I am still littering my front end code with inline sql type statements (linq, not sql.... but still I feel that this should be abstracted away from the front end).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose I wrap the LINQ statement we've been using as an example in a method.  As far as I can tell, the only way I can return it is this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class EmployeesDAL
{
    public IEnumerable LoadEmployeesAndManagers()
    {
            MyCompanyContext context = new MyCompanyContext();

            var emps = from e in context.Employees
            join m in context.Employees
            on e.ManagerEmpID equals m.EmpID
            select new
                      { e,
                        m.FullName
                      };

            return emps;
    }

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my front end code I would do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;EmployeesDAL dal = new EmployeesDAL;
var emps = dal.LoadEmployeesAndManagers();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This of course returns an IEnumerable; but I cannot use this like any other ORM like you say (unless of course I misunderstand), because I cannot do this (again, this is a contrived example):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;txtEmployeeName.Text = emps[0].FullName
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I meant by "I lose strong typed goodness."  I think that I am starting to agree with Crucible; that LINQ-to-SQL was not designed to be used in this way.  Again, if I am not seeing things correctly, someone show me the way :)&lt;/p&gt;

The real question is, which interface is routeable to a desired address. Right now, you're querying for the "default route" - the one that applies if no specific route to destination exists. But, you're ignoring any specific routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, for 99.9% of home users, that'll do the trick. They're not likely to have much of a routing table, and GetBestInterface will automatically prefer wired over wireless - so you should be good. Throw in an override option for the .1% of cases you screw up, and call it a day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, for corporate use, you should be using GetBestInterface for a specific destination - otherwise, you'll have issues if someone is on the same LAN as your destination (which means you should take the "internal" interface, not the "external") or has a specific route to your destination (my internal network could peer with your destination's network, for instance).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then again, I'm not sure what you plan to do with this adapter "connected to the Internet", so it might not be a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

Now, I don't know much about either Windows APIs or VB(A) programming, but the "standard" Windows file dialog I see most often in Microsoft applications would seem like an obvious choice, but it does not seem to be easily available from Outlook's macros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the directory picker should at least allow to manually paste a file path/URI as a starting point for navigation, since I sometimes already have an Explorer window open for the same directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are the best choices for directory pickers in Outlook macros?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two things I already tried and did not find totally satisfactory are (the code is simplified and w/o error handling and probably also runs in older Outlook versions):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Using &lt;code&gt;Shell.Application&lt;/code&gt; which does not allow me to actually paste a starting point via the clipboard or do other operations like renaming folders:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  Set objShell = CreateObject("Shell.Application")
  sMsg = "Select a Folder"
  cBits = 1
  xRoot = 17
  Set objBFF = objShell.BrowseForFolder(0, sMsg, cBits, xRoot)
  path = objBFF.self.Path
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Using the &lt;code&gt;Office.FileDialog&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;Microsoft Word 12.0 Object Library&lt;/code&gt; (via tools/references) and then using Word's file dialog, which somehow takes forever on my Vista system to appear and does not always actually bring Word to the foreground. Instead, sometimes Outlook is blocked and the file dialog is left lingering somewhere in the background:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  Dim objWord As Word.Application
  Dim dlg As Office.FileDialog
  Set objWord = GetObject(, "Word.Application")
  If objWord Is Nothing Then
     Set objWord = CreateObject("Word.Application")
  End If
  objWord.Activate
  Set dlg = objWord.FileDialog(msoFileDialogFolderPicker)
  path = dlg.SelectedItems(1)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You will have to assign the "Lock pages in memory" privilege to any user that runs your &gt; application. This includes administrators&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select Control Panel -&gt; Administrative Tools -&gt; Local Security Policy&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Windows Vista you need also make sure that the application is run as Administrator (by right-clicking on the application or the shell and choosing "Run as adminstrator".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, it helps to have a freshly booted machine since the large pages can "run out" due to fragmentation of the heap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SharpDevelop - It doesn't really stand up to Visual Studio. Thou I found it to be useful at times since it has support for Visual Basic.

But the really USEFUL features that I found were : Conversion between C# &amp;lt;-&gt; VB Code, PInvoke, and Regex Expressions. Oh and lets not forget support for Boo :D.

&lt;p&gt;For fetching data, or at least the fetching of data that is coming from more than one table you can use stored procedures or views because the results will not be anonymous so you can return them from an outside method. For instance, using a stored proc:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    public ISingleResult&amp;lt;GetEmployeesAndManagersResult&amp;gt; LoadEmployeesAndManagers()
    {
        MyCompanyContext context = new MyCompanyContext();

        var emps = context.GetEmployeesAndManagers();

        return emps;
    }

I looked into section 25 (paragraphs 7 to 10).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methods returning values that may change from one call to another, as in your case, should be volatile (from 7.1.6.1/11: "volatile is a hint to the implementation to avoid aggressive optimization involving the object because the value of the object might be changed by means undetectable by an implementation").  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Predicates "shall not apply any non-constant function through the dereferenced iterators" (paragraphs 7 and 8).  I take this to mean that they are not required to use non-volatile methods, and that your use-case is thus ok with respect to the standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the wording was "predicates should apply const functions..." or something like that, then I would have concluded that 'const volatile' functions were not ok.  But this is not the case.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, *:80 means "use port 80 for all hosts in this configuration". When you do this, Apache tries to bind that host to 0.0.0.0:80, which means that host will receive every single packet coming to the machine through port 80, regardless of what virtual host it was intended to go to. That's something you should use only once, and only if you have &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; host in that configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, if you have the same *:80 directive on two hosts in the configuration file, the server won't load because it will try to bind 0.0.0.0:80 twice, failing on the second try. (which explains the "Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted. : make_sock: could not bind to address 0.0.0.0:80" message).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You never "update" on this table (except to change the valid of isCurrent), just insert new rows. For any given EmployeeId, only 1 row can have isCurrent == 1. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complexity of maintaining this can be hidden by views and "instead of" triggers (in oracle, I presume similar things other RDBMS), you can even go to materialized views if the tables are too big and can't be handled by indexes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method is ok, but you can end up with some complex queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I'm pretty fond of your Design 2 way of doing it, which is how I've done it in the past as well. Its simple to understand, simple to implement and simple to maintain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also creates very little overhead for the database and application, especially when performing read queries, which is likely what you'll be doing 99% of the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it's going to be mostly for reporting / human readable history, we've implemented this scheme in the past...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a table called 'AuditTrail' or something that has the following fields...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ID] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
[UserID] [int] NULL,
[EventDate] [datetime] NOT NULL,
[TableName] [varchar](50) NOT NULL,
[RecordID] [varchar](20) NOT NULL,
[FieldName] [varchar](50) NULL,
[OldValue] [varchar](5000) NULL,
[NewValue] [varchar](5000) NULL
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can then add a 'LastUpdatedByUserID' column to all of your tables which should be set every time you do an update / insert on the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can then add a trigger to every table to catch any insert / update that happens and creates an entry in this table for each field that's changed.  Because the table is also being supplied with the 'LastUpdateByUserID' for each update / insert, you can access this value in the trigger and use it when adding to the audit table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use the RecordID field to store the value of the key field of the table being updated.  If it's a combined key, we just do a string concatenation with a '~' between the fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sure this system may have drawbacks - for heavily updated databases the performance may be hit, but for my web-app, we get many more reads than writes and it seems to be performing pretty well.  We even wrote a little VB.NET utility to automatically write the triggers based on the table definitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a thought!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if the resulting value is not used, I would use ++i. But not because it is more efficient: because it correctly states my intent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would try the second approach though. You could simplify this by having just one Employees table with a DateModified field.

&lt;p&gt;There are situations where you may want to use a surrogate key (Option 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are not that the compound key is a good candidate key over time.  Particularly with temporal data (data that changes over time).  What if you wanted to add another row to the UserWidget table with the same UserId and WidgetId?  Think of Employment(EmployeeId,EmployeeId) - it would work in most cases except if someone went back to work for the same employer at a later date&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If you want to create your own auditing mechanisms (or similar) and don't want keys to get too long.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a rule of thumb, when modeling data you will find that most associative entities (many to many) are the result of an event.  Person takes up employment, item is added to basket etc.  Most events have a temporal dependency on the event, where the date or time is relevant - in which case a surrogate key may be the best alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, take option 2, but make sure that you have the complete model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Employee (Id, Name, ... , IsActive)

containing that info and link it with entity tables using PK\FK relation.&lt;/p&gt;

Pros of this approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple data base structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No conflicts since table becomes append-only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can rollback to previous version by simply changing IsActive flag&lt;/li&gt;

Database or disk access isn't business logic. UI isn't business logic. Network communications aren't business logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, business logic is the rules that describe how a business operates, not how a software architecture operates. Business logic also has a tendency to change. For example, it may be a business requirement that every customer has a single credit card associated with their account. This requirement may change so that customers can have several credit cards. In theory, this should just be a change to the business logic and other parts of your software will not be affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that's theory. In the real world (as you've found) the business logic tends to spread throughout the software. In the example above, you'll probably need to add another table to your database to hold the extra credit card data. You'll certainly need to change the UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purists say that business logic should always be completely separate and so would even be against having tables named "Customers" or "Accounts" in the database.
Taken to its extreme you'd end up with an incredibly generic, impossible to maintain system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's definitely a strong argument in favour of keeping most of your business logic together rather than smearing it throughout the system, but (as with most theories) you need to be pragmatic in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It is not a contract on either a.) how the method should be implemented and b.) what that method should be doing exactly (it only guarantees the return type), the two reasons that I glean would be your motive in wanting this kind of test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There could be many parts of the contract not specified in the return type.  A language-agnostic example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public interface List {

  // adds o and returns the list
  public List add(Object o);

  // removed the first occurrence of o and returns the list
  public List remove(Object o);

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your unit tests on LinkedList, ArrayList, CircularlyLinkedList, and all the others should test not only that the lists themselves are returned, but also that they have been properly modified.&lt;/p&gt;

In the case that MyInterfaceImpl1 class is subclassed your test could be broken, as the subclass is instanceof MyInterfaceImpl1. I would rewrite as follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMyInterface fromFactory = factory.create(...);  
Assert.assertEquals(fromFactory.getClass().getName(), MyInterfaceImpl1.class.getName());

&lt;p&gt;For example, I have two index.php files in my Zend app, one for the front end, and one for the admin area. These index files each need there own bootstrap.php with different relative paths in because they are included by different index files, which means they &lt;strong&gt;have to be relative to the original requested index file, not the bootstrap file they are defined within&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could explain why your problem is intermittent, there could be another file including the bootstrap somewhere that is only used occasionally. I'd search through all the sites files for 'bootstrap.php' and see all the places which are including / requiring this file.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a blunt tool - meaning you can check/parse the value to make sure a date field contains a date. From there, I usually let my business logic check as to whether the data entry makes sense in context with how it was submitted. For example, does the date submitted fall into the expected range? Does the currency value submitted fall into the expected range? Finally, on the server side, Foreign Key constraints and Indexes can catch any errors that slip through, which will bubble up a DB exception as a last resort, which can be handled by the app code.

Also, it allows you to handle data errors where it is most easy to recover from:  up near the UI (whether in the controller or within the UI layer for simpler apps) where the data is entered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some data errors that you can't check for programatically, however.  For instance, you can't validate data on the existance of related data without roundtripping to the db.  Data errors like these should be validated by the database through the use of relationships, triggers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where you deal with errors returned by database calls is an interesting one.  You could deal with them at the data layer, the business logic layer, or the UI layer.  The best practice in this instance is to let those errors bubble up to the last responsible moment before handling them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you have an ASP.NET MVC web application, you have three layers (from bottom to top):  Database, controller and UI (model, controller, and view).  Any errors thrown by your data layer should be allowed to bubble up into your controller.  At this level your application "knows" what the user is attempting to do, and can correctly inform the user about the error, suggesting different ways to handle it.  Attempting to recover from these errors within the data layer makes it much harder to know what's going on within the controller.  And, of course, placing business logic within the UI is not considered a best practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR:  Validate everywhere, handle validation errors at the last responsible moment.&lt;/p&gt;

Is it possible to do this through the other methods...yes, but it's really easy to build a program to modify an xml/xsl document on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think of using XSL to transform one xml document to another and displaying it as html (which is really what you're doing), you're opening up your system to allow other programs to access the data on the page via XML.  You can do this through the other methods, but using an xsl transformation forces it to output xml every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would tread lightly with creating a system this way.  You'll find a lot of pit falls you aren't expecting, and if you don't know xsl really really well, there is going to be a learning curve also.&lt;/p&gt;

Validation is one of those places, as you will have three completely different and unrelated places where validation is not only possible but absolutely needed:  Within the UI, within the business logic, and within the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of a web application.  You want to reduce trips to the server, so you include javascript validation of client data entry.  But you can't trust what the user enters, so you must perform validation within your business logic before touching the database.  And the database must have its own validation in order to prevent data corruption.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's no clean way to unify these three different types of validation within a single component.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some attempts being made to unify cross-cutting responsibilities like validation within policy injectors like the P&amp;amp;P group's &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tomholl/archive/2007/02/23/announcing-the-policy-injection-application-block.aspx"&gt;Policy Injection Application Block combined with their Validation Application Block&lt;/a&gt;, but these are still code based.  If you have validation that's not in code, you still have to maintain parallel logic separately...&lt;/p&gt;

That doesn't happen until you get the stream from the URLConnection().  When you first get the connection you can add/change headers and other connection properties before actually opening it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;URLConnection's lifecycle is a bit odd.  It doesn't send the headers to the server until you've gotten one of the streams.  If you just get the input stream then I believe it does a GET, sends the headers, then lets you read the output.  If you get the output stream then I believe it sends it as a POST, as it assumes you'll be writing data to it (You may need to call setDoOutput(true) for the output stream to work).  As soon as you get the input stream the output stream is closed and it waits for the response from the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, this should do a POST:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;URL myURL = new URL("http://example.com/my/path");
URLConnection conn = myURL.openConnection();
conn.setDoOutput(true);
conn.setDoInput(true);

OutputStream os = conn.getOutputStream();
os.write("Hi there!");
os.close();

InputStream is = conn.getInputStream();
// read stuff here
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this would do a GET:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;URL myURL = new URL("http://example.com/my/path");
URLConnection conn = myURL.openConnection();
conn.setDoOutput(false);
conn.setDoInput(true);

InputStream is = conn.getInputStream();
// read stuff here
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;URLConnection will also do other weird things.  If the server specifies a content length then URLConnection will keep the underlying input stream open until it receives that much data, &lt;em&gt;even if you explicitly close it&lt;/em&gt;.  This caused a lot of problems for us as it made shutting our client down cleanly a bit hard, as the URLConnection would keep the network connection open.  This probably probably exists even if you just use getStream() though.&lt;/p&gt;

It's not just about commenting and giving good variables names. It deals with how humans comprehends code.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top-down: assuming the user knows the system domain, he tends to make assumptions on how it would be implemented, so he'll scan the system packages and classes looking for entities he can identify. Giving good names to your classes and properly modularizing it would help very much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bottom-up: once the user reaches a portion of code he'll start navigation from there, building chunks of knowledge. If your system has low cohesion and lots of implicit dependencies the user will be lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my questions. I know that I can get a handle on a physical device with a call to CreateFile. Will the MBR always be on \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE0? Also, I'm still learning the Windows API to read directly from the disk. Is readabsolutesectors and writeabsolutesectdors the two functions I'm going to need to use to read/write to the disk sectors which contain the MBR?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit from from what I've learned on my own.
The MBR will not always be on \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE0. Also, you can write to the bootsector (at least as Administrator on XP) by call CreateFile with the device name of the drive that contains the MBR. Also, you can write to this drive by simply calling WriteFile and passing the handle of the device created by calling CreateFile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit to address Joel Coehoorn. 
I need to edit the MBR because I'm working on a project that needs to modify hardware registers after POST in BIOS, but before Windows will be allowed to boot. Our plan is to make these changes by modifying the bootloader to execute our code before Windows boots up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit for Cd-MaN.
Thanks for the info. There isn't anything in your answer, though, that I didn't know and your answer doesn't address my question. The registry in particular absolutely will not do what we need for multiple reasons. The big reason being that Windows is the highest layer among multiple software layers that will be running with our product. These changes need to occur even before the lower levels run, and so the registry won't work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. for Cd-MaN.
As I understand it, the information you give isn't quite correct. For Vista, I think you can write to a volume if the sectors being written to are boot sectors. See &lt;a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/942448" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://support.microsoft.com/kb/942448&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've found that as long as you throw enough RAM at it, it seems to perform ok.  Many VMs will allocate 128-512, which is on the lower end of what I'd consider useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, a bigger drawback is that it is unsupported.  Vendor supplied updates will kill the installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for legality, it is Legal to run OS X Server (Leopard) in a virtualised form, but only on Apple hardware.  You cannot even run OS X Client in VMWare Fusion or Parallels, legally.  Nor can you run any version of OS X on VMWare Server, or similar on other machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, you may be able to legally run OS X Server virtualised on Apple hardware, even if the guest OS is not OS X.  However, it would likely be subject to the same caveats as above: it would require a "fixed" version of the OS.  And by "fixed", I mean like my cat is "fixed".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Header file paths are not set-up correctly. When you find a type where intellisense is not working, use the IDE to click through each header file to find the one containing the type. (Right click on #include and select Open Document...). If this fails before you get to the file which declares the type then this is your problem. Make sure header file search paths are set-up correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) The intellisense database is corrupt. This happens ALL The time. You need to close the solution, delete the .ncb file, and then reopen the solution.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm writing complex code for a package comprised of a standalone application and also a library version of the core that people can use from inside other apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both our own app and presumably ones that users create with the core library are likely to be run both in batch mode (off-line, scripted, remote, and/or from command line), as well as interactively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The library/app takes complex and large runtime input and there may be a variety of error-like outputs including severe error messages, input syntax warnings, status messages, and run statistics.  Note that these are all &lt;em&gt;incidental&lt;/em&gt; outputs, not the primary purpose of the application which would be displayed or saved elsewhere and using different methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these (probably only the very severe ones) might require a dialog box if run interactively; but it needs to log without stalling for user input if run in batch mode; and if run as a library the client program obviously wants to intercept and/or examine the errors as they occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all needs to be cross-platform: Linux, Windows, OSX.  And we want the solution to not be weird on any platform.  For example, output to stderr is fine for Linux, but won't work on Windows when linked to a GUI app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Client programs of the library may create multiple instances of the main class, and it would be nice if the client app could distinguish a separate error stream with each instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's assume everybody agrees it's good enough for the library methods to log errors via a simple call (error code and/or severity, then printf-like arguments giving an error message).  The contentious part is how this is recorded or retrieved by the client app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've done this many times over the years, and am never fully satisfied with the solution.  Furthermore, it's the kind of subproblem that's actually not very important to users (they want to see the error log if something goes wrong, but they don't really care about our technique for implementing it), but the topic gets the programmers fired up and they invariably waste inordinate time on this detail and are never quite happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anybody have any wisdom for how to integrate this functionality into a C++ API, or is there an accepted paradigm or a good open source solution (not GPL, please, I'd like a solution I can use in commercial closed apps as well as OSS projects)?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I don't use VS2008 for C++, only VB &amp;amp; C#, but I find that when intellisense stops working (true for VS2003/2005/2008) it's because something in the project/file is broken - usually a bad reference or code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VB and C# have much better intellisense support due to the ability to reflect on the referenced assemblies to build the intellisense tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C++ has to walk the include files for function prototypes, and if the paths are not correct it will not find all the prototype headers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a feeling it may be to do with forward declarations of classes. e.g. to reduce the complexity of includes in header files we normally do something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class MyPredeclared;

class SomeOtherClass
{
private:
    MyPredeclared* m_pPointer;

&lt;p&gt;But it's basically a research problem.  People who are doing it well are getting peer-reviewed research papers out of it.  But &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; at this point still means that the best GPU/Cuda results are approximately competitive with best-of-class solutions on CPU/multi-core/SSE.  So I think that it's a little early to assume that using Cuda is going to accelerate a ray tracer.  The problem is that although ray tracing is "embarrassingly parallel" (as they say), it is not the kind of "fixed input and output size" problem that maps straightforwardly to GPUs -- you want trees, stacks, dynamic data structures, etc.  It can be done with Cuda/GPU, but it's tricky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your question wasn't clear about your experience level or the goals of your project.  If this is your first ray tracer and you're just trying to learn, I'd avoid Cuda -- it'll take you 10x longer to develop and you probably won't get good speed.  If you're a moderately experienced Cuda programmer and are looking for a challenging project and ray tracing is just a fun thing to learn, by all means, try to do it in Cuda.  If you're making a commercial app and you're looking to get a competitive speed edge -- well, it's probably a crap shoot at this point... you might get a performance edge, but at the expense of more difficult development and dependence on particular hardware.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check back in a year, the answer may be different after another generation or two of GPU speed, Cuda compiler development, and research community experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you suddenly discover that your chosen platform doesn't scale. Or isn't fast enough. Or something. Worse, there's a new kid on the database block (something like MonetDB, CouchDB, Cache, say but much cooler) that would solve all your problems (even if your only problem, like mine, is having an uncool databse platform). And you can't switch to it without recoding half your application.&lt;/p&gt;

(Assuming that you're after the learning experience, I'm not giving any actual code.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlying formula is the same as above, but this approach averages the partial sums to accelerate the convergence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Define a two parameter function, pie(h, w), such that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;pie(0,1) = 4/1
pie(0,2) = 4/1 - 4/3
pie(0,3) = 4/1 - 4/3 + 4/5
pie(0,4) = 4/1 - 4/3 + 4/5 - 4/7
... and so on
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So your first opportunity to explore recursion is to code that "horizontal" computation as the "width" parameter increases (for "height" of zero).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then add the second dimension with this formula:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;pie(h, w) = (pie(h-1,w) + pie(h-1,w+1)) / 2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which is used, of course, only for values of h greater than zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about this algorithm is that you can easily mock it up with a spreadsheet to check your code as you explore the results produced by progressively larger parameters. By the time you compute pie(10,10), you'll have an approximate value for pi that's good enough for most engineering purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

So there are quite a few small "transactions" wrapped in a larger transaction and basically there is an outstanding transaction count in the nesting code. If there are any outstanding children when you end the parent, its all rolled back.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prefer client-side transaction handling where available. If you are relegated to doing sps or other server side logical units of work, server side transactions are fine.&lt;/p&gt;

    rubyArray.each{|x|

&lt;p&gt;The Array's each method implementation &lt;strong&gt;yields&lt;/strong&gt; control over to the caller (the 'puts x') with &lt;strong&gt;each&lt;/strong&gt; element of the array neatly presented as x. The caller can then do whatever it needs to do with x.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However &lt;strong&gt;.Net&lt;/strong&gt; doesn't go all the way here.. C# seems to have coupled yield with IEnumerable, in a way forcing you to write a foreach loop in the caller as seen in Mendelt's response. Little less elegant.&lt;/p&gt;

foreach(int i in obCustomClass.Each())

&lt;p&gt;The way I did it was to create totally new table to user/pass and then replace these columns in the respective software with foreign keys to your new table - this required &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt; of custom tweaking of core files in each application - mainly making sure all SQL requests to this data have the extra join needed for your new table. If I find the time I will maybe try and provide a step by step of the changes needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some &lt;strong&gt;pretty big drawbacks&lt;/strong&gt; to this approach though. The main one being from now on your gonna have to hand update any patches   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-lisp prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;(define (un-ended name)

  (print "How can I get here?"))

&lt;p&gt;Tail-Recursion means the recursion that conclude the function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-lisp prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;(define (un-ended name)
  (print "hello")
  (un-ended 'me))

&lt;p&gt;See, the last thing un-ended function (procedure, in Scheme jargon) does is to call itself. Another (more useful) example is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-lisp prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;(define (map lst op)
  (define (helper done left)
    (if (nil? left)

                (cdr left))))
  (reverse (helper '() lst)))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the helper procedure, the LAST thing it does if left is not nil is to call itself (AFTER cons something and cdr something). This is basically how you map a list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tail-recursion has a great advantage that the interperter (or compiler, dependent on the language and vendor) can optimize it, and transform it into something equivalent to a while loop. As matter of fact, in Scheme tradition, most "for" and "while" loop is done in tail-recursion manner (there is no for and while, as far as I know).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reviewed the external assembly and there is no evidence of multithreading.  By that, I mean no reference exists to System.Threading and no delegates were used whatsoever.  I'm familiar with that constitutes instantiating a thread.  I verify this by observing the Threads toolbox at the time of the unhandled exception to view there is only one running thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have an open issue with the ANTLR folks so perhaps they've been able to tackle this issue before.  I've been able to replicate it in a simple console app project using .NET 2.0 and 3.5 under VS 2008 and VS 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's just a pain point because it forces my code to only work with known valid parser input.

In the scenario you posted, you're using control arrays to pair a button up with a textbox.  In .Net, you would probably do this with a custom control.  The custom control would consist of a button, a textbox, and maybe a shared/static timer.  The form uses several instances of this custom control.  You implement the logic needed for the control once, and it's isolated to it's own source file which can be tracked and edited in source control without requiring a merge with the larger form class, or easily re-used on multiple forms or even in multiple projects.  You also don't have to worry about making sure the command button index matches up with the textbox index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a custom control for this instead of a control array is loosely analogous to using class to group data instead of an array, in that you get names instead of indexes.  &lt;/p&gt;

It's an oldy but a goody, and I think it's a must read for anyone - like myself about 2 months ago - who gets a little let's say "over-eager" to agile-up their workplace.  Agile offers a lot of good practices, but you have to take them all with a grain of salt and adopt what you're lacking and skip out on all the other crud that might be unuseful for a particular situation - e.g. the daily scrum. If your co-worker would just like to code in quiet (read Peopleware for why this is a good thing) and she's being a productive team member quit bugging her with your scrumming a let her work in whatever way she likes most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are usually less "hostile" about these practices if you just approach them and simply say "Do you have a sec? Listen, communication is really a problem right now, I feel like I don't know what you're doing and I really don't want to step on your toes again and spend two days writing something you already did like last week, so let's work on this.  I'd like to try X, what do you think?".  Be compassionate and don't tolerate "bad apples", that's literally how I agiled up my workplace, and many problems have started evaporating. We're by no means an 100% XP or 100% Scrum compliant place, because we just use whatever works and was needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;xs:element name="person"&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;xs:complexType&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;xs:sequence&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;xs:element name="name"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;xs:complexType&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;xs:sequence&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;xs:element name="firstname"/&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;xs:element name="lastname"/&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;/xs:sequence&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/xs:complexType&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;/xs:element&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;xs:element name="address"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;xs:complexType&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;xs:sequence&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;xs:element name="street"/&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;xs:element name="city"/&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;/xs:sequence&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/xs:complexType&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;/xs:element&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/xs:sequence&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;/xs:complexType&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;xs:element name="person"&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;xs:complexType&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;xs:sequence&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;xs:element name="name" type="nameType"/&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;xs:element name="address" type="addressType"/&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/xs:sequence&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/xs:complexType&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/xs:element&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;xs:complexType name="nameType"&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;xs:sequence&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;xs:element name="firstname"/&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;xs:element name="lastname"/&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/xs:sequence&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/xs:complexType&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;xs:complexType name="addressType"&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;xs:sequence&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;xs:element name="street"/&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;xs:element name="city"/&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/xs:sequence&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/xs:complexType&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, my question: When are you using nested types instead of making them global?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone interested: My question somehow relates to this question (&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33746/xml-attribute-vs-xml-element" rel="nofollow"&gt;XML attribute vs element&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, yes. The generally accepted "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture" rel="nofollow"&gt;three-tier&lt;/a&gt;" application design for databases says that your logic should be in the middle tier, between the client and the database. However, sometimes you need some logic in a trigger or need to index on a function, requiring that some code be placed into the database. In that case all the usual "which language should I use?" questions come up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you only need a little logic, the most-portable language should probably be used (pl/pgSQL). If you need to do some serious programming though, you might be better off using a more expressive language (maybe pl/ruby). This will always be a judgment call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"is there any valid reason to use an untrusted language?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As above, yes. Again, putting direct file access (for example) into your middle tier is best when possible, but if you need to fire things off based on triggers (that might need access to data not available directly to your middle tier), then you need untrusted languages. It's not ideal, and should generally be avoided. And you definitely need to guard access to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the for /? help, basename can be extracted using the nifty ~n option. So, the base script would read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for %%f in (*.in) do call process.cmd %%~nf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, in process.cmd, assume that %0 contains the base name and act accordingly. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo The file is %0
copy %0.in %0.out
ren %0.out monkeys_are_cool.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There might be a better  way to do this in one script, but I've always been a bit hazy on how to pull of multiple commands in a single for loop in a batch file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: That's fantastic! I had somehow missed the page in the docs that showed that you could do multi-line blocks in a FOR loop. I am going to go have to go back and rewrite some batch files now...&lt;/p&gt;

They seem to appear as soon as you attempt to do anything beyond a simple test case. I wasted more time than I'd like to admit debugging problems that turned out to be related to the various configuration (size) settings on both the client and server. I think I ended up modifying almost all of them, ex. MaxBufferPoolSize, MaxBufferSize, MaxConnections, MaxReceivedMessageSize, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, the SvcTraceViewer utility also mentioned is great. I did run into a few cases where it wasn't as helpful as I would have liked, but overall it's a nice tool for analyzing the communications flow and errors.&lt;/p&gt;
