The CreateController method that you will implement handles creating the controller instance to handle the request by the RouteHandler and the ControllerActionInvoker.  The convention is to use the name of the controller, when creating it, therefore you will need to override this functionality.  This will be where you put your custom logic for creating the controller based on the route since you will have multiple controllers with the same name, but in different folders.  Then you will need to register your custom controller factory in the application startup, just like your routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area you will need to take into consideration is finding your views when creating the controller.  If you plan on using the same view for all of them, then you shouldn't have to do anything different than the convention being used.  If you plan on organizing your views also, then you will need to create your own ViewLocator also and assign it to the controller when creating it in your controller factory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get an idea of code, there are a few questions I have answered on SO that relate to this question, but this one is different to some degree, because the controller names will be the same.  I included links for reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19746/views-in-seperate-assemblies-in-aspnet-mvc" rel="nofollow"&gt;Views in separate assemblies in ASP.NET MVC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another route, but may require some compromises will be to use the new AcceptVerbs attribute.  Check this &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36197/aspnet-mvc-structuring-controllers" rel="nofollow"&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; out for more details.  I haven't played with this new functionality yet, but it could be another route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't quite understand the code you posted yourself, then what happens is when the call to getchats.php is complete, a function "stateChanged" is called and that function will be responsible for handling the response. Since the script you're calling and the function itself is prefixed with "gets" then I'm pretty sure the response is something you're going to be interested in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That aside, there are a number of ways to improve on the code you posted. I'd guess it works by declaring a single "xmlHttp" object and then making that available to every function (because if it doesn't, the stateChanged function has no way of getting the response). This is fine until you run an AJAX request before the last one (or last few) haven't replied yet, which in that case the object reference is overwritten to the latest request each time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, any AJAX code worth its salt provides functionality for sucess and failure (server errors, page not found, etc.) cases so that the appriopiate message can be delivered to the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you just want to use AJAX functionality on your website then I'd point you in the direction of &lt;a href="http://www.jquery.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="http://www.prototypejs.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;similar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.mootools.net" rel="nofollow"&gt;framework&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BUT if you actually want to understand the technology and what is happening behind the scenes, I'd continue doing what you're doing and asking specific questions as you try to build a small lightweight AJAX class on your own. This is how I done it, and although I use the jQuery framework today.. I'm still glad I know how it works behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

You can provide some basic guidelines, like the ones you outlined, but in the end people must understand them in order to follow them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's an extract from &lt;a href="http://blog.looplabel.net/2008/07/28/best-practices-for-version-control/"&gt;my recommended best practices for version control&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Always write a comment when committing something to the repository. Your comment should be brief and to the point, describing what was changed and possibly why. If you made several changes, write one line or sentence about each part. If you find yourself writing a very long list of changes, consider splitting your commit into smaller parts, as described earlier. Prefixing your comments with identifiers like Fix or Add is a good way of indicating what type of change you did. It also makes it easier to filter the content later, either visually, by a human reader, or automatically, by a program.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you fixed a specific bug or implemented a specific change request, I also recommend to reference the bug or issue number in the commit message. Some tools may process this information and generate a link to the corresponding page in a bug tracking system or automatically update the issue based on the commit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here are some examples of good commit messages:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Changed paragraph separation from indentation to vertical space.
    ...
    Fix: Extra image removed.
    Fix: CSS patched to give better results when embedded in javadoc.
    Add: A javadoc {@link} tag in the lyx, just to show it's possible.
    ...
    - Moved third party projects to ext folder.
    - Added lib folder for binary library files.
    ...
    Fix: Fixed bug #1938.
    Add: Implemented change request #39381.&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, you have to follow up on people and give them directions whenever they don't follow the commit rules. You could of course implement a script to enforce some of the rules (like the prefixing and bug referencing), but that will not catch the lazy people who don't bother to write anything meaningful. I think it's important to explain why you want these conventions and how they will benefit the development team. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up a commit e-mail list and monitor it for message is a good way to keep track of what people are doing. Whenever someone is committing something without a satisfactory message, you will know so and can tell them. I guess is the same way as with coding conventions, for them to be successful, somebody has to follow up on them.&lt;/p&gt;

What I'm wondering about is having just part of the expression be case-insensitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, let's say I have a string like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;fooFOOfOoFoOBARBARbarbarbAr
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if I want to match all occurrences of "foo" regardless of case but I only want to match the upper-case "BAR"s?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ideal solution would be something that works across regex flavors but I'm interested in hearing language-specific ones as well (Thanks &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43632/can-you-make-just-part-of-a-regex-case-insensitive#43636"&gt;Espo&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The link Espo provided was very helpful.  There's a good example in there about turning modifiers on and off within the expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my contrived example, I can do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(?i)foo*(?-i)|BAR
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which makes the match case-insensitive for just the foo portion of the match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That seemed to work in most regex implementations except Javascript, Python, and a few others (as Espo mentioned).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It maybe possible also to change the value globally on the machine config.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern regex flavors allow you to apply modifiers to only part of the regular expression. If you insert the modifier (?ism) in the middle of the regex, the modifier only applies to the part of the regex to the right of the modifier. You can turn off modes by preceding them with a minus sign. All modes after the minus sign will be turned off. E.g. (?i-sm) turns on case insensitivity, and turns off both single-line mode and multi-line mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all regex flavors support this. JavaScript and Python apply all mode modifiers to the entire regular expression. They don't support the (?-ismx) syntax, since turning off an option is pointless when mode modifiers apply to the whole regular expressions. All options are off by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can quickly test how the regex flavor you're using handles mode modifiers. The regex (?i)te(?-i)st should match test and TEst, but not teST or TEST.&lt;/p&gt;

If you can, RAID0 them (stripe) or RAID0+1 (stripe+mirror) if you can get 4 drives (stripe == split content over the two disks, so you can read from both at the same time. stripe+mirror == the safe version of striping, so your code is on TWO disks at all times) &lt;/li&gt;

The rails moniker is not an accident. It follows a strict Model-View-Controller paradigm, making it easy to do the right thing. There's a lot of stuff already done that you probably always planned to do but never came around to, like an easy way to switch between production/development/testing environments, each of which has it's own characteristics (i. e. in testing and development, emails are not send out but logged). The migrations infrastructure makes deployments of changed models (database structures) quite easy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these ideas are impossible to replicate in other frameworks, and I assume many of them have already done that. But overall there's a level of completeness and attention to detail that I had not seen before. Ruby, the language, needs some getting used to, but it is quite elegant compared to php.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding security, that's probably mostly your job. Sanitizing input etc. Rails has some built-in mechanisms to help you with it, but so does any other framework out there, I assume. &lt;/p&gt;

{
     DateTime Now { get { return new DateTime(2008, 09, 3, 9, 6, 13); } }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be some overhead in providing the clock to the class that relies on it, but that could be handled by any number of dependency injection solutions (using an Inversion of Control container, plain old constructor/setter injection, or even a &lt;a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jean-paul_boodhoo/archive/2007/10/15/the-static-gateway-pattern.aspx"&gt;Static Gateway Pattern&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other mechanisms of delivering an object or method that provides desired times also work, but I think the key thing is to avoid resetting the system clock, as that's just going to introduce pain on other levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, using &lt;code&gt;DateTime.Now&lt;/code&gt; and including it in your calculations doesn't just not feel right - it robs you of the ability to test particular times, for example if you discover a bug that only happens near a midnight boundary, or on Tuesdays. Using the current time won't allow you to test those scenarios. Or at least not whenever you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can perhaps write a reg ex to check ".*Boolean.*". But what if you have quote(") inside the string? So, you have more work to not exclude (\") pattern. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;4) Do not match if in a comment. (// or /* */)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For '//', you can have a regex to exclude //.* But, better could be to first put a regex to compare the whole line for the // comments ((.*)(//.*)) and then apply replacement only on $1 (first matching pattern).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For /* */, it is more complex as this is multiline pattern. One approach can be to first run whole of you code to match multiline comments and then take out only the parts not matching ... something like ... (.*)(/*.**/)(.*). But, the actual regex would be even more complex as you would have not one but more of multi-line comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what if you have /* or */ inside // block? (I dont know why would you have it.. but Murphy's law says that you can have it). There is obviously some way out but my idea is to emphasize how bad-looking the regex will become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My suggestion here would be to use some lexical tool for C++ and replace the token Boolean with bool. Your thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

It is designed for exactly this sort of thing - graphing CPU usage, memory usage, disc-usage and such. sort of like MRTG (but MRTG is primarily aimed at graphing router's traffic, graphing anything but bandwidth with it is very hackish)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing Munin plugins is very easy (it was one of the projects goals). They can be written in almost anything (shell script, perl/python/ruby/etc, C, anything that can be execute and produce an output). The plugin output format is basically &lt;code&gt;disc1usage.value 1234&lt;/code&gt;. And debugging the plugins is very easy (compared to MRTG)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've set it up on my laptop to monitor disc-usage, bandwidth usage (by pulling data from my ISP's control panel, it graphs my two download "bins", uploads and newsgroup usage), load average and number of processes. Once I got it installed (currently slightly difficult on OS X, but it's trivial on Linux/FreeBSD), I had written a plugin in a few minutes, and it worked, first time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would describe how it's setup, but the munin site will do that far better than I could!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's an example installation &lt;a href="http://munin.ping.uio.no/" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some alternatives are nagios and cacti. You could also write something similar using rrdtool. Munin, MRTG and Cacti are basically all far-nicer-to-use systems based around this graphing tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want something really, really simple, you could do..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import os
import time
while True:
    disc_usage = os.system("df -h / | awk '{print $3}'")
    log = open("mylog.txt")
    log.write(disc_usage + "\n")
    log.close()
    time.sleep(60*5)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;f = open("mylog.txt")
lines = f.readlines()

# Convert each line to a float number
lines = [float(cur_line) for cur_line in lines]

# Get the biggest and smallest
biggest = max(lines)
smallest = min(lines)

for cur_line in lines:
    base = (cur_line - smallest) + 1 # make lowest value 1
    normalised = base / (biggest - smallest) # normalise value between 0 and 1
    line_length = int(round(normalised * 28)) # make a graph between 0 and 28 characters wide
    print "#" * line_length
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That'll make a simple ascii graph of the disc usage. I &lt;em&gt;really really&lt;/em&gt; don't recommend you use something like this. Why? The log file will get bigger, and bigger, and bigger. The graph will get progressively slower to graph. RRDTool uses a rolling-database system to store it's data, so the file will never get bigger than about 50-100KB, and it's consistently quick to graph as the file is a fixed length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short. If you want something to easily graph almost anything, use &lt;a href="http://munin.projects.linpro.no/" rel="nofollow"&gt;munin&lt;/a&gt;. If you want something smaller and self-contained, write something with RRDTool.&lt;/p&gt;

(I'd still need to figure out how to know when to break a line when using a non-monospaced font, as the users are currently doing that manually when they enter the data in the spreadsheet)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason Z:
If I set it to wrap, and I already have &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; lines, it would make &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1 or 2 lines on the slide, which is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, I have 2 windows in a split (C-x 3):
&lt;img src="http://bitthicket.com/files/emacs-2split.JPG" alt="alt text" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I use the right window for code buffers and the left window for the CScope search buffer.  When you do a CScope search and select a result, it automatically updates the right-side window to show the buffer referred to by the result.  This is all well and good, except that it causes me to lose my place in some other buffer that I was studying.  Sometimes this is no biggie, because [C-s u] gets me back to where I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would be better, though, is to have 3 split windows like this ([C-x 2] in the left window):
&lt;img src="http://bitthicket.com/files/emacs-3split.jpg" alt="alt text" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And have the bottom left window contain the CScope search buffer, and the top left window be the only buffer that CScope ever updates.  That way, I can see my CScope searches and navigate around the code without losing the buffer I'm focused on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone know how I can do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are at least a dozen ways to pass an array or list to a query; each has their own unique pros and cons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sommarskog.se/arrays-in-sql-2008.html"&gt;Table-Valued Parameters&lt;/a&gt;. SQL 2008 and higher only, and probably the
closest to a universal "best" approach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sommarskog.se/arrays-in-sql-2005.html#iterative"&gt;The Iterative Method&lt;/a&gt;. Pass a delimited string and loop through it.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sommarskog.se/arrays-in-sql-2005.html#CLR"&gt;Using the CLR&lt;/a&gt;. SQL 2005 and higher from .NET languages only. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sommarskog.se/arrays-in-sql-2005.html#XML"&gt;XML&lt;/a&gt;. Very good for inserting many rows; may be overkill for SELECTs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sommarskog.se/arrays-in-sql-2005.html#tblnum"&gt;Table of Numbers&lt;/a&gt;. Higher performance/complexity than simple iterative method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sommarskog.se/arrays-in-sql-2005.html#fixed-length"&gt;Fixed-length Elements&lt;/a&gt;. Fixed length improves speed over the delimited
string.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sommarskog.se/arrays-in-sql-2005.html#fn_nums"&gt;Function of Numbers&lt;/a&gt;. Variations of Table of Numbers and
Fixed-length where the number are generated in a function rather than
taken from a table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sommarskog.se/arrays-in-sql-2005.html#CTEs"&gt;Recursive Common Table Expression&lt;/a&gt; (CTE). SQL 2005 and higher,
still not too complex and higher performance than Iterative method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sommarskog.se/arrays-in-sql-2005.html#dynamic-sql"&gt;Dynamic SQL&lt;/a&gt;. Can be slow and has security implications. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passing the List as &lt;a href="http://www.sommarskog.se/arrays-in-sql-2005.html#manyparameters"&gt;Many Parameters&lt;/a&gt;. Tedious and error prone, but
simple.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sommarskog.se/arrays-in-sql-2005.html#realslow"&gt;Really Slow Methods&lt;/a&gt;. Methods that uses charindex, patindex
or LIKE.&lt;/li&gt;

This is because every time a request comes in, the server starts the CGI application in its own process.  This is bad for two reasons:  1)  Starting and stopping a process can take time and 2) you can't cache anything in memory.  You can go with FastCGI, but I would argue that you'd be better off just writing a straight &lt;a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/"&gt;WSGI&lt;/a&gt; app if you're going to go that route (the way WSGI works really isn't a whole heck of a lot different from CGI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, your choices are for the most part how much you want the framework to do.  You can go with an all singing, all dancing framework like Django or Pylons.  Or you can go with a mix-and-match approach (use something like CherryPy for the HTTP stuff, SQLAlchemy for the database stuff, paste for deployment, etc).  I should also point out that most frameworks will also let you switch different components out for others, so these two approaches aren't necessarily mutually exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I dislike frameworks that do too much magic for me and prefer the mix-and-match technique, but I've been told that I'm also completely insane.  :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much web programming experience do you have?  If you're a beginner, I say go with Django.  If you're more experienced, I say to play around with the different approaches and techniques until you find the right one.&lt;/p&gt;

Then use a structure like &lt;em&gt;com.mycompany.myapp.somemodule.somelayer&lt;/em&gt;, e.g. &lt;em&gt;com.mycompany.myapp.client.view&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;com.mycompany.myapp.server.model&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the top level of packages for application &lt;em&gt;modules&lt;/em&gt;, in the old-fashioned computer-science sense of modular programming, ought to be obvious. However, on most of the projects I have worked on we end up forgetting to do that, and end up with a mess of packages without that top-level structure. This anti-pattern usually shows itself as a package for something like 'listeners' or 'actions' that groups otherwise unrelated classes simply because they happen to implement the same interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within a module, or in a small application, use packages for the application layers. Likely packages include things like the following, depending on the architecture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;com.mycompany.myapp.view&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;com.mycompany.myapp.model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;com.mycompany.myapp.services&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;com.mycompany.myapp.rules&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;com.mycompany.myapp.persistence&lt;/em&gt; (or 'dao' for data access layer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;com.mycompany.myapp.util&lt;/em&gt; (beware of this being used as if it were 'misc')&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within each of these layers, it is natural to group classes by type if there are a lot. A common anti-pattern here is to unnecessarily introduce too many packages and levels of sub-package so that there are only a few classes in each package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-1 % 5 should be 4 because that's the next allowed digit going in the reverse direction (i.e., it can't be 5, since that's out of range).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And following along by that logic, -2 must be 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to think of how it will work is that you keep adding or subtracting 5 until the number falls between 0 (inclusive) and 5 (exclusive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure about machine dependence - I've never seen an implementation that was, but I can't say it's never done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application need to prefetch a batch of 100 IDs from a sequence. It's relatively easy to do in a single-threaded, non-distributed environment, you can just issue these queries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;select seq.nextval from dual;
alter sequence seq increment by 100;
select seq.nextval from dual;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first select fetches the first sequence ID that the application can use, the second select returns the last one that can be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things get way more interesting in a multithreaded environment. You can't be sure that before the second select another thread doesn't increase the sequence by 100 again. This issue can be solved by synchronizing the access on the Java side - you only let one thread begin fetching the IDs at one time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation becomes really hard when you can't synchronize because parts of the application doesn't run on the same JVM, not even on the same physical machine. I found some references on forums that others have problems with solving this problem too, but none of the answers are really working not to mention being reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some more information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can't really play with the transaction isolation levels. I use JPA and the change would affect the entire application, not only the prefetching queries and that's not acceptable for me.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;select setval('seq', nextval('seq') + n - 1 )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution by Matthew works when you can use a fixed increment value (which is perfectly acceptable in my case). However is there a solution when you don't want to fix the size of the increment, but want to adjust it dynamically?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can create team builds and trigger them manually in Visual Studio or via the command line (where they complete successfully). However check ins to the source tree do not cause a build to trigger despite the option to build every check in being ticked on the build definition. &lt;strong&gt;Update: To be clear I had a fully working build definition with the CI option enabled.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source tree is configured is a pretty straight forward manner with code either under a &lt;em&gt;Main&lt;/em&gt; folder or under a &lt;em&gt;Branch\branchName&lt;/em&gt; folder. Each branch of code (including main) has a standard Team Build definition relating to the solution file contained within. The only thing that is slightly changed from default settings is that the build server working folder; i.e. for main this is &lt;em&gt;Server:"$\main" Local:"c:\build\main"&lt;/em&gt; due to path length. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing I've been able to guess at (possible red herring) is that there might be some oddity with the developer workspaces. Currently each developer maps Server:"$\" to local:"c:\tfs\" so that there is only one workspace for all branches. This is mainly to avoid re-mapping problems that some of the developers had previously gotten themselves into. But I can't see how this would affect CI.&lt;/p&gt;

In this approach, every page has its own executable file, which must be loaded and parsed on every request.  This makes it really simple to get something up and running, but scales badly both in terms of performance and organization.  So when I need a very dynamic page very quickly that won't grow into a larger system, I use a CGI script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One step up from this is embedding your Python code in your HTML code, such as with PSP.  I don't think many people use this nowadays, since modern template systems have made this pretty obsolete.  I worked with PSP for awhile and found that it had basically the same organizational limits as CGI scripts (every page has its own file) plus some whitespace-related annoyances from trying to mix whitespace-ignorant HTML with whitespace-sensitive Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step up is very simple web frameworks such as web.py, which I've also used.  Like CGI scripts, it's very simple to get something up and running, and you don't need any complex configuration or automatically generated code.  Your own code will be pretty simple to understand, so you can see what's happening.  However, it's not as feature-rich as other web frameworks; last time I used it, there was no session tracking, so I had to roll my own.  It also has "too much magic behavior" to quote Guido ("upvars(), bah").&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you have feature-rich web frameworks such as Django.  These will require a bit of work to get simple Hello World programs working, but every major one has a great, well-written tutorial (especially Django) to walk you through it.  I highly recommend using one of these web frameworks for any real project because of the convenience and features and documentation, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately you'll have to decide what you prefer.  For example, frameworks all use template languages (special code/tags) to generate HTML files.  Some of them such as Cheetah templates let you write arbitrary Python code so that you can do anything in a template.  Others such as Django templates are more restrictive and force you to separate your presentation code from your program logic.  It's all about what you personally prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example is URL handling; some frameworks such as Django have you define the URLs in your application through regular expressions.  Others such as CherryPy automatically map your functions to urls by your function names.  Again, this is a personal preference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally use a mix of web frameworks by using CherryPy for my web server stuff (form parameters, session handling, url mapping, etc) and Django for my object-relational mapping and templates.  My recommendation is to start with a high level web framework, work your way through its tutorial, then start on a small personal project.  I've done this with all of the technologies I've mentioned and it's been really beneficial.

Here's what to do when faced with this situation (note, the name of the gem is automatically wildcarded, so you can type just &lt;em&gt;sql&lt;/em&gt; and get a list of all gems beginning with &lt;em&gt;sql&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ gem list --remote --all sqlite

*** REMOTE GEMS ***

sqlite (2.0.1, 2.0.0, 1.3.1, 1.3.0, 1.2.9.1, 1.2.0, 1.1.3, 1.1.2, 1.1.1, 1.1)
sqlite-ruby (2.2.3, 2.2.2, 2.2.1, 2.2.0, 2.1.0, 2.0.3, 2.0.2)
sqlite3-ruby (1.2.4, 1.2.3, 1.2.2, 1.2.1, 1.2.0, 1.1.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.0, 0.9.0, 0.6.0, 0.5.0)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you can choose the version you would like to install:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;gem install sqlite3-ruby -v 1.2.3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To successfully install hpricot, I did this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;gem install hpricot -v 0.6
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annoyingly, doing a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;gem update&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tries to update the gems to their latest, broken-on-Windows, versions. When the update routine encounters an error, it ditches you out of the whole process.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, is this issue a bug in gems? Should gems not automatically detect the platform and install the latest compatible version?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Hypertheaded means "doesn't actually have two CPU's, but it fakes it". If you have a process with just one thread running, then you get bad performance. It was a good short-term measure, but compared to having two REAL CPU's, it's a slow hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think that's the problem at all. The machine is plenty high spec enough to be professional C++ development machine for large projects. I can run Eclipse (which is Java, which is memory hungry and slower than native code) and this is still way faster than VS 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I doubled the amount of RAM from 1GB to 2GB. This helps a lot with linking large applications. We also use Incredibuild to accelerate compilation. But it's the VS app that is slow.&lt;/p&gt;

On my machine, I wouldn't call VS 2005 slow, but if you compare it to notepad or my web browser it seems slow.  Here's some things that might help people figure out what's going on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn off any features that could affect load time.  This includes uninstalling all add-ons and making sure that VS isn't configured to automatically open a project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reboot your machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time how long it starts VS 2005 to start, from the time you click the icon until the program starts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a program that you're willing to post here that seems to compile slowly (this might not be possible depending on what it takes to make a slow compile); post the program and how long it takes your computer to build it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you know anyone else with the same kind of machine that has VS 2005 installed?  Does it seem slower or faster than yours?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe Lord Kelvin said the best thing that can be said about situations like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge of it is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind; it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely, in your thoughts, advanced it to the stage of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until you give us some measurements to look at, we can't tell you if your machine is genuinely slow or if you are expecting more out of your machine than it can give.  Your HT CPU might be the problem; I have roughly equivalent machines at work and at home, but my dual-core work machine runs circles around my single-core home machine when it comes to running VS.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What is the difference between Oracle
  SIDs and Oracle SERVICE NAMES. One
  config tool looks for SERVICE NAME and
  then the next looks for SIDs! What's
  going on?!&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Oracle SID is the unique name that
  uniquely identifies your
  instance/database where as Service
  name is the TNS alias that you give
  when you remotely connect to your
  database and this Service name is
  recorded in Tnsnames.ora file on your
  clients and it can be the same as SID
  and you can also give it any other
  name you want.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;SERVICE_NAME is the new feature from
  oracle 8i onwards in which database
  can register itself with listener. If
  database is registered with listener
  in this way then you can use
  SERVICE_NAME parameter in tnsnames.ora
  otherwise - use SID in tnsnames.ora.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Also if you have OPS (RAC) you will
  have different SERVICE_NAME for each
  instance.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;SERVICE_NAMES specifies one or more
  names for the database service to
  which this instance connects. You can
  specify multiple services names in
  order to distinguish among different
  uses of the same database. For
  example:&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;SERVICE_NAMES = sales.acme.com,
  widgetsales.acme.com&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;You can also use service names to
  identify a single service that is
  available from two different databases
  through the use of replication.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;In an Oracle Parallel Server
  environment, you must set this
  parameter for every instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short: SID = the unique name of your DB instance, ServiceName = the alias used when connecting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I know I could just "chop the stream" at &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; seconds (calculating from the bitrate and header size) when delivering the file, but this is a bit dirty and a real PITA on a VBR track. I'd like to be able to generate a proper MP3 file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both mp3split and ffmpeg are both good solutions. I chose ffmpeg as it is commonly installed on linux servers and is also &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=205275&amp;amp;package_id=248632"&gt;easily available for windows&lt;/a&gt;.  Here's some more good command line parameters for generating previews with ffmpeg&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;-t &amp;lt;seconds&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; chop after specified number of seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;-y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; force file overwrite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;-ab &amp;lt;bitrate&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; set bitrate e.g. &lt;em&gt;-ab 96k&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;-ar &amp;lt;rate Hz&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; set sampling rate e.g. &lt;em&gt;-ar 22050&lt;/em&gt; for 22.05kHz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;-map_meta_data &amp;lt;outfile&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;infile&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; copy track metadata from infile to outfile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;instead of setting -ab and -ar, you can copy the original track settings, as Tim Farley suggests, with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After further experimentation, I found that you can even use just &lt;code&gt;$(':checkbox')&lt;/code&gt; to select them. It's interesting that you can use the &lt;code&gt;.slice()&lt;/code&gt; function to get the range, but you also have the option of doing it in the selector with &lt;code&gt;:gt&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;:lt&lt;/code&gt;. I do find the syntax of &lt;code&gt;.slice()&lt;/code&gt; to be cleaner than using the selector filters, though.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;They don't really have any formal meaning. A folder is a folder to SVN.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In short: SID = the unique name of
  your DB, ServiceName = the alias used
  when connecting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not strictly true.. SID = unique name of the INSTANCE (eg the oracle process running on the machine). Oracle considers the "Database" to the be files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Service Name = alias to an INSTANCE (or many instances). The main purpose of this is if you are running a cluster, the client can say "connect me to SALES.acme.com", the DBA can on the fly change the number of instances which are available to SALES.acme.com requests, or even move SALES.acme.com to a completely different database without the client needing to change any settings.&lt;/p&gt;

The examples folks give about templating, in response to your specific complaint about page editors breaking your code, are important, but represent just one example of this tactic. As your program gets larger and more complex it becomes harder to modify and debug--even if your designer is not breaking your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the most common separation is a three way split between data, logic and presentation as described in the design pattern Model-View-Controller (MVC). You do not need a full blown &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller" rel="nofollow"&gt;MVC&lt;/a&gt; framework in place to implement the same basic principles. The idea is simply to encapsulate code that deals with your data (model) in one place, the code that presents this data to the user (view) in another. You tie that code together with code that is only concerned with presenting the right data to the right user at a the right time (controller).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From your description, it sounds like you have right now is a &lt;a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/transactionScript.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Transaction Script&lt;/a&gt; pattern, where you have a php file "dothis.php" that is loaded in the browser, and all the function definitions and HTML for the display are together. You already have functions, so you are already beginning to encapsulate pieces of logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I would approach this would be, in keeping with the other answers here about templating, is to remove all of the HTML into another file only referencing simple PHP variables and maybe some loops (but as little conditional switching as you can). That will make the template easier to read and harder to break. When your page editor wants to modify the layout, give them THAT file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You then separate all of your data access functions to another file, ideally creating a class (or several classes, depending on how complex your data is and how frequently you need to reuse it). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point your "dothis.php" has been stripped down to maybe some configuration code (which you can separate out to an include, and some authentication code (which you can separate out to its own class), and is only calling the data access functions, and calling the included template file. Your controller itself is therefore greatly simplified and easier to manage.&lt;/p&gt;

The try-code and the catch-code are both so small that everything fits in the instruction and data caches.

&lt;p&gt;If you compare exception handling to traditional C-style return-value checking, this caching effect should be taken into account as well (the question is usually ignored in discussions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One of the big changes we are making
  starting with the VS 2008 release is
  to support what we call
  "Multi-Targeting" - which means that
  Visual Studio will now support
  targeting multiple versions of the
  .NET Framework, and developers will be
  able to start taking advantage of the
  new features Visual Studio provides
  without having to always upgrade their
  existing projects and deployed
  applications to use a new version of
  the .NET Framework library.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Now when you open an existing project
  or create a new one with VS 2008, you
  can pick which version of the .NET
  Framework to work with - and the IDE
  will update its compilers and
  feature-set to match this.  Among
  other things, this means that
  features, controls, projects,
  item-templates, and assembly
  references that don't work with that
  version of the framework will be
  hidden, and when you build your
  application you'll be able to take the
  compiled output and copy it onto a
  machine that only has an older version
  of the .NET Framework installed, and
  you'll know that the application will
  work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That way you can use VS2008 to develop .NET 2.0 projects that will work on both .NET 2.0, 3.0 and 3.5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent versions of Postgres (since late 2010) have the &lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/functions-aggregate.html#FUNCTIONS-AGGREGATE-TABLE"&gt;&lt;code&gt;string_agg(expression, delimiter)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; function that will do exactly what the question asked for, even letting you specify the delimiter string:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT company_id, string_agg(employee, ', ')
FROM mytable
GROUP BY company_id;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Update as of PostgreSQL 8.4:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL 8.4 (in 2009) introduced &lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/interactive/functions-aggregate.html"&gt;the aggregate function &lt;code&gt;array_agg(expression)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which concatenates the values into an array. Then &lt;code&gt;array_to_string()&lt;/code&gt; can be used to give the desired result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT company_id, array_to_string(array_agg(employee), ', ')
FROM mytable
GROUP BY company_id;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Original Answer (for pre-8.4 PostgreSQL):&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no built-in aggregate function to concatenate strings. It seems like this would be needed, but it's not part of the default set. A web search however reveals some manual implementations &lt;a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-novice/2003-09/msg00177.php"&gt;the same example&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CREATE AGGREGATE textcat_all(
  basetype    = text,
  sfunc       = textcat,
  stype       = text,
  initcond    = ''
);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/sql-createaggregate.html"&gt;Here is the &lt;code&gt;CREATE AGGREGATE&lt;/code&gt; documentation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to get the ", " inserted in between them without having it at the end, you might want to make your own concatenation function and substitute it for the "textcat" above. Here is one I put together but haven't tested (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;update:&lt;/strong&gt; tested on 8.3.12 and working fine&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CREATE FUNCTION commacat(acc text, instr text) RETURNS text AS $$
  BEGIN
    IF acc IS NULL OR acc = '' THEN
      RETURN instr;
    ELSE
      RETURN acc || ', ' || instr;
    END IF;
  END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The function above will output a comma even if the value in the row is null/empty, which outputs:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a, b, c, , e, , g
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would prefer to remove extra commas to output:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a, b, c, e, g
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;just add an &lt;code&gt;ELSIF&lt;/code&gt; check to the function:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CREATE FUNCTION commacat_ignore_nulls(acc text, instr text) RETURNS text AS $$
  BEGIN
    IF acc IS NULL OR acc = '' THEN
      RETURN instr;
    ELSIF instr IS NULL OR instr = '' THEN
      RETURN acc;
    ELSE
      RETURN acc || ', ' || instr;
    END IF;
  END;

It is a Java implementation of the PHP runtime and purportedly allows you to access Java objects directly from your PHP (part of me says "yay, at last").&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, while I have been itching to try a project this way, I would probably keep the separation between Java EE and PHP unless there was a real reason to integrate on the code-level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, why don't you try an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture" rel="nofollow"&gt;SOA&lt;/a&gt; approach, where your PHP "front-end" calls into the Struts application over a defined REST or SOAP API (strong vote for REST here) over HTTP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://mydomain.com/rest/this-is-a-method-call?parameter1=foo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use Struts to build your entire "backend" model, dealing only with business logic and data, and completely ignoring presentation. As you expose the API with these URLs, and you are basically building a REST API (which may come in handy later if you ever need to provide greater access to your backend, perhaps by other client apps).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your PHP application can be built separately (and rather thinly), calling into the REST API (perhaps using Curl) as if it would call into a database or some native PHP class library.&lt;/p&gt;

Current perforce docs says you have have 2 users and 5 clients without having to start purchasing licenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have reasons to switch to perforce depending on your workflow and if you have need of branching the way perforce does it.  Not being overly familar with some the other products mentioned here, I can't tell you how perforce compares in the feature department for things like branching, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is speedy, and it's been rock solid for us (300+ developers on a 10+ year old codebase).  We store several T of info and it's been quite responsive.  With a small number of users, I doubt that you'd experience many performance troubles assuming you had good hardware for your server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having used VSS before, I believe that you can get so many benefits out of a better SCM system that switching should be considered regardless of whether you have corruption or not.  Branching alone might be worth it for you.  A true client/server model, better interfaces (programmatically and command line) are a couple of other things that could really help just improve your workflow and help somewhat with productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, my view of Perforce is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's fast and quite reliable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plenty of cross platform client tools (windows, unix, mac, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it's free for 2 users and 5 clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrates into developer studio (and other tools)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has a powerful branching system (that might or might not be right for you).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has several scriptable interfaces (python, perl, ruby, C++)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly YMMV -- I only offer this alternative up as something that might be worthwhile looking into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's probably the best bet, unless your diffing tool has special powers.
For example, you could&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cut -b13- file1 &amp;gt; trimmed_file1
cut -b13- file2 &amp;gt; trimmed_file2
diff trimmed_file1 trimmed_file2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Luckily they include a dry run button so that you can see if you are doing it right.  The complication is in the configuration of what you want to merge to where.  Once you get that set up for the merge the merge generally goes fine.  Then you need to resolve any and all conflicts and then commit your merged in working copy to the repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Mercurial can make the configuration of the merge easier then I can say that would make merging 100% easier then Subversion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott, I'm working with very basic hosting packages that don't allow remote connections to the DB.  I don't know from the specs on RedGate (which I can't afford anyway) whether they provide a workaround for that, and although there are also API's out there (such as the one from Apex), I didn't see the point in investing in a solution that was still going to require more programming on my part. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My solution is to drop an ASPX page on the site that acts as a kind of "schema service", returning the collected metadata as XML.  I set up a little AJAX app that compares any number of catalog instances to a master and shows the diffs.  It's not perfect, but a major step forward for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Getting the Label Near the Radio Button&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what you mean by "next to": on the same line and near, or on separate lines? If you want all of the radio buttons on the same line, just use margins to push them apart. If you want each of them on their own line, you have two options (unless you want to venture into &lt;code&gt;float:&lt;/code&gt; territory):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;s &lt;/code&gt; to split the options apart and some CSS to vertically align them:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;style type='text/css'&amp;gt;
    .input input
    {
        width: 20px;
    }
&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;div class="input radio"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;fieldset&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;legend&amp;gt;What color is the sky?&amp;lt;/legend&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;input type="hidden" name="data[Submit][question]" value="" id="SubmitQuestion" /&amp;gt;

        &amp;lt;input type="radio" name="data[Submit][question]" id="SubmitQuestion1" value="1"  /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;label for="SubmitQuestion1"&amp;gt;A strange radient green.&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;

is perfect for this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;style type='text/css'&amp;gt;
    .input label.focused
    {
        background-color: #EEEEEE;
        font-style: italic;
    }
&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script type='text/javascript' src='jquery.js'&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script type='text/javascript'&amp;gt;
    $(document).ready(function() {
        $('.input :radio').focus(updateSelectedStyle);
        $('.input :radio').blur(updateSelectedStyle);
        $('.input :radio').change(updateSelectedStyle);
    })

    function updateSelectedStyle() {
        $('.input :radio').removeClass('focused').next().removeClass('focused');
        $('.input :radio:checked').addClass('focused').next().addClass('focused');
    }
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

With r approx. 3.57 you get chaotic results that depend on the initial point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you graph this versus time you can get lots of different series just by manipulating that parameter r.  If you were to graph it as x(n+1) v. x(n) without connecting dots, you see a simple parabola take shape over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most basic functions from chaos theory and trying more interesting polynomials, graphing them as x(n+1) v. x(n) and watching a shape form, and then graphing x(n) v. n is a fun and interesting way to create series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graphing x(n+1) v. x(n) makes it quickly obvious if you're only visiting a small number of points.  Deeper recurrences become more interesting as well, and using different values of x(0) to check on sensitivity to initial conditions is also of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I have a Dictionary which I'm access through properties, which of these formats would you prefer for the property?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/// &amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;
/// This class's FirstProperty property
/// &amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;
[DefaultValue("myValue")]
public string FirstProperty {
    get {
        return Dictionary["myKey"];
    }
    set {
        Dictionary["myKey"] = value;
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably the typical way of doing it. It's fairly efficient, easy to understand, etc. The only disadvantage is with a longer or more complex key it would be possible to misspell it or change only one instance or something, leading me to this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/// &amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;
/// This class's SecondProperty property
/// &amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;
[DefaultValue("myValue")]
private const string DICT_MYKEY = "myKey"
public string SecondProperty {
    get {
        return Dictionary[DICT_MYKEY];
    }
    set {
        Dictionary[DICT_MYKEY] = value;
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is marginally more complicated, but seems to offer additional safety, and is closer to what I would think of as the "Code Complete" solution. The downside is that when you also have a ///  block and a [DefaultValue()] block above the property already, it starts getting a bit crowded up there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So which do you like better, and why? Does anybody have any better ideas?&lt;/p&gt;

The tutorials provide simple instructions for setting up apps, models, and views, but there is less information about how apps and projects should be broken down, how much sharing is allowable/necessary between apps in a typical project (obviously that is largely dependent on the project) and how/where general templates should be kept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have examples, suggestions, and &lt;em&gt;explanations&lt;/em&gt; as to why a certain project layout is better than another?  I am particularly interested in the incorporation of large numbers of unit tests (2-5x the size of the actual code base) and string externalization / templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way, you're only parsing once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's easiest to use one of the 'Split' UDFs, but so many people have posted examples of those, I figured I'd go a different route ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example will create a temporary table for you to join on (#tmpDept) and fill it with the department id's that you passed in.  I'm assuming you're separating them with commas, but you can -- of course -- change it to whatever you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;IF OBJECT_ID('tempdb..#tmpDept', 'U') IS NOT NULL
BEGIN
    DROP TABLE #tmpDept
END

SET @DepartmentIDs=REPLACE(@DepartmentIDs,' ','')

CREATE TABLE #tmpDept (DeptID INT)
DECLARE @DeptID INT
IF IsNumeric(@DepartmentIDs)=1
BEGIN
    SET @DeptID=@DepartmentIDs
    INSERT INTO #tmpDept (DeptID) SELECT @DeptID
END
ELSE
BEGIN
     WHILE CHARINDEX(',',@DepartmentIDs)&amp;gt;0
        BEGIN
      SET @DeptID=LEFT(@DepartmentIDs,CHARINDEX(',',@DepartmentIDs)-1)
      SET @DepartmentIDs=RIGHT(@DepartmentIDs,LEN(@DepartmentIDs)-CHARINDEX(',',@DepartmentIDs))
      INSERT INTO #tmpDept (DeptID) SELECT @DeptID
     END
END
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will allow you to pass in one department id, multiple id's with commas in between them, or even multiple id's with commas and spaces between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you did something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT Dept.Name 
FROM Departments 
JOIN #tmpDept ON Departments.DepartmentID=#tmpDept.DeptID
ORDER BY Dept.Name
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would see the names of all of the department IDs that you passed in...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this can be simplified by using a function to populate the temporary table... I mainly did it without one just to kill some boredom :-P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Just before the old markup is replaced with the updated HTML, all the DOM elements in the panel are examined for Microsoft Ajax behaviours or controls attached to them. To avoid memory leaks, the components associated with DOM elements are disposed, and then destroyed when the HTMl is replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as far as I know, any asp.net ajax components within the update panel are disposed to prevent memory leaks, but anything else in there will just be replaced with the html received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you don't have any asp.net ajax components in the target container for the response, it would be basically the same as an inner html replacement with any other js framework / ajax request, so i would say that it's just the how the browser handles this, rather than asp.net ajax causing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, while it may be "leaking", it may be by design, meaning that the browser might not have reclaimed the dom elements yet and released them. Also, drip might be causing those to leak, as it is attaching to those dom elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To define custom template tags or filters, you must create a sub-directory in the applications directory called templatetags, and it must contain a file named __init__.py so that it can be imported as a Python module.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To define unit tests which will automatically be noticed by Djangos testing framework, put them in a module called tests (which can be either a file named tests.py or a directory called tests). The testing framework will also find any doctests in that module, but the preferred place for those is, of course, the docstrings of the classes or functions theyre designed to test.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To provide custom SQL which will be executed immediately after your application is installed, create a sub-directory called sql inside the applications directory; the file names should be the same as the names of the models whose tables theyll operate on; for example, if you have an app named weblog containing a model named Entry, then the file sql/entry.sql inside the apps directory can be used to modify or insert data into the entries table as soon as its been created. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The note about tests.py and tests (the directory) also holds for models, which helps address the problem of having way to many tests (or models) for one file.&lt;/p&gt;

    MethodBase method     = new StackFrame(2).GetMethod();
    ParameterInfo[] parameters = method.GetParameters();
    builder.AppendFormat(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, ExceptionFormat, new object[] { method.DeclaringType.Name, method.Name });
    if ((parameters.Length &amp;gt; 0) || (parameterValues.Length &amp;gt; 0))

    }

    exception = (Exception)Activator.CreateInstance(typeof(T), new object[] { builder.ToString(), innerException });
    return (T)exception;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;MethodBase method     = new StackFrame(2).GetMethod();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walks up the stack frame to find the calling method then we use reflection to obtain parameter information values passed to it for a generic error reporting function. To get the current method simply use current stack frame (1) instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As others have said for the current methods name you can also use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;MethodBase.GetCurrentMethod()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prefer walking the stack because if look internally at that method it simply creates a StackCrawlMark anyway. Addressing the Stack directly seems clearer to me &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post 4.5 you can now use the [CallerMemberNameAttribute] as part of the method parameters to get a string of the method name - this may help in some scenarios (but really in say the example above)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public void Foo ([CallerMemberName] string methodName = null)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seemed to be mainly a solution for INotifyPropertyChanged support where previously you had strings littered all through your event code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IE blog entry on MSDN is referring to changes made to IE7 that allow IE7 to stay in standards mode when using the appropriate doctype even if it is preceded by an XML prolog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would generally recommend omitting the prolog and keeping the browser in standards mode; I think this will make your life easier moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;

st.GetFrames();

  &lt;p&gt;Direct Connect! Weve always done
  everything we can to make sure that 
  Fog Creek Copilot can connect in any
  networking situation, no matter  what
  firewalls or NATs are in place. To
  make this happen, both parties  make
  outbound connections to our server,
  which relays traffic on their  behalf.
  Well, in many cases, this isnt
  necessary. So version 2.0 does 
  something rather clever: it sets up
  the initial connection through our 
  servers, so you get connected right
  away with 100% reliability. But then 
  once youre all connected, it quietly,
  in the background, looks for a  way to
  make a direct connection. If it cant,
  no big deal: you just keep  relaying
  through our server. If you can make a
  direct peer-to-peer  connection, it
  silently shifts your data onto the
  direct connection. You  wont notice
  anything except, probably, much faster
  communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does any of my data have embedded commas?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does any of my data have embedded double-quotes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does any of my data have have newlines?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I need to support Unicode strings?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see several problems in your code above. The comma thing first of all... you are stripping commas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CsvLine.Append(Format(b.Price, "c").Replace(",", ""))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? In CSV, you should be surrounding anything which has commas with quotes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CsvLine.Append(String.Format("\"{0:c}\"", b.Price))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(or something like that... my VB is not very good). If you're not sure if there are commas, but put quotes around it. If there are quotes in the string, you need to escape them by doubling them. &lt;code&gt;"&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;code&gt;""&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;b.Title.Replace("\"", "\"\"")
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then surround this by quotes if you want. If there are newlines in your string, you need to surround the string with quotes... yes, literal newlines &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; allowed in CSV files. It looks weird to humans, but it's all good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good CSV writer requires some thought. A good CSV reader (parser) is just plain hard (and no, regex not good enough for parsing CSV... it will only get you about 95% of the way there).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there is Unicode... or more generally I18N (Internationalization) issues. For example, you are stripping commas out of a formatted price. But that's assuming the price is formatted as you expect it in the US. In France, the number formatting is reversed (periods used instead of commas, and &lt;em&gt;vice versa&lt;/em&gt;). Bottom line, use culture-agnostic formatting wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the issue here is &lt;em&gt;generating&lt;/em&gt; CSV, inevitably you will need to parse CSV. In .NET, the best parser I have found (for free) is &lt;a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/database/CsvReader.aspx"&gt;Fast CSV Reader&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.codeproject.com"&gt;CodeProject&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;The programs can already talk to each other through Joel's server, so they can exchange information with each other and Joel's server.  Further, Joel has their external IP addresses, and they give joel information about their internal IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They decide to try this hole punch technique.  Computer A initiates a TCP connection with Computer B using B's external IP address.  It won't go through, but what it does is tell's A's router that it needs to allow incoming packets from B on a given port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computer B does the same thing, but its message gets through to A since A's router opened a port/ip combination that matches what B sent (there's some port magic that happens here - this is non trivial, but doable).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B's router remembers that B initiated a connection with A on a given port and IP, and so A's packets now flow into B past their router correctly as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it's actually pretty straight forward, but the implementation has details, especially regarding how ports are given to new TCP connections, and how NAT routers &lt;em&gt;typically&lt;/em&gt; deal with TCP requests and how they map to external ports.  These details are the interesting, and difficult, bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;const int ArraySize = 10;
int[] values = new int[ArraySize];

//...

for (int i = 0; i &lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, depending on the complexity of the loop body, the compiler might be able to replace the loop with inline calls.  I have no idea if the .NET compiler does this, and it's of limited utility if the size of the enumerable type is dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One situation where &lt;code&gt;foreach&lt;/code&gt; might perform better is with data structures like a linked list where random access means traversing the list; the enumerator used by &lt;code&gt;foreach&lt;/code&gt; will probably iterate one item at a time, making each access O(1) and the full loop O(n), but calling the indexer means starting at the head and finding the item at the right index; O(N) each loop for O(n^2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I don't usually worry about it and use &lt;code&gt;foreach&lt;/code&gt; any time I need all items and don't care about the index of the item.  If I'm not working with all of the items or I really need to know the index, I use &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;.  The only time I could see it being a big concern is with structures like linked lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you plan to query the Oracle Database from an External Java Program (Either within a Swing Application or an Application Server) then you need to learn 2 core APIs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPA (Java Persistence API)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JDBC is the core API that allows a Java Program to interact with any RDBMS so you should at least know how it works so whenever you have to dig into low-level code, you will actually know what's happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPA is the latest Java API for Persistence which basically allows one to map Plain Old Java Object (AKA PoJo) to RDBMS Table Structures. There are multiple known implementation available but I would recommend Hibernate or TopLink as good starting points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, you can start to dig into other known frameworks like the Spring Framework for  some other RDBMS related APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, one common rule of thumb is that every table should have a primary key and that the key should be &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_key" rel="nofollow"&gt;devoid of information content&lt;/a&gt;.  So I was wondering if anyone had written a book or published papers regarding design patterns for designing relational databases?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Gaius,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the question that a database designer needs to weigh--what is the probable stability of the database structure?  Given a long-enough horizon nothing is stable. Or to say the converse, given a long-enough horizon, everything is subject to change.  A surrogate key (in theory) should never change its meaning because it never had meaning to begin with.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess the other thing to consider in that particular design scenario is who is it that will be seeing the primary key?  If the primary key is something that end-users will actually need to refer to then it makes sense to make it something they can understand.  But I can't think of many cases where an end-user needs to see a primary key; usually the primary key is present to allow the DB engine to speed up certain operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My original thought in asking the question was to find design patterns for database design that were codified by more experienced database designers than myself so as to, hopefully, avoid some easily avoidable errors.  It would be interesting reading if anyone had ever codified database design anti-patterns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merging and branching are very different, and if you branch and merge frequently, unless you have SVN 1.5 running on your server have to know when you branched (this isn't very clear in the Tortoise SVN dialogs).  Michael says the branching and merging is intuitive, I would argue that after using CVS for 10 years, it is not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your are running the SVN server on Linux, it may be hard to get your SA to move to svn 1.5, as the default install 1.4.x.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merging conflicts is not nearly as easy or as clear (at least to me and my co-workers) in TortoiseSVN as it is in TortoiseCVS.  The three pane approach takes some getting used to and the WinMerge (my preferred merge tool) doesn't do a three pane merge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beware: many of the online tutorials and magazine articles I have read obviously don't branch and merge, you should set up your main repository as https://svn.yoursvnserver.com/repos/YourProject/Trunk and branches on https://svn.yoursvnserver.com/repos/YourProject/Branches/BranchX .  You can clean up if you start your repos in the wrong place, but it leads to confusion.&lt;/li&gt;

Something like "This image belongs to ...". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you open the image in a viewer/browser, it looks like a normal jpeg, but if you open it in a text editor, the last line would be readable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same method allows you include an actual file into an image. (&lt;a href="http://www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/hide-file-in-picture/" rel="nofollow"&gt;hide a file inside of an image&lt;/a&gt;) I've found that it's a bit hit-or-miss, but 7-zip files seem to work. You could hide all sorts of copywrite goodies inside the image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, it's not unbreakable by any stretch of the imagination, but it's completely invisible to the naked eye.&lt;/p&gt;

If displaying these as options in a SELECT tag, the spaces are not visible but the sorting still brings them to the front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that may be a little hacky in some contexts. In Java the thing to do would be to extend StringComparator, override the compare() method making the US and Canada special cases, then sort the list (or array) passing in your new comparator as the sort algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I would imagine it might be simpler to just find the relevant entries in the array, remove them from the array and add them again at the start. If you are in some kind of framework which will re-sort the array, then it might not work. But in most cases that will do just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[edit] I see that you are using a hash and not an array - so it will depend on how you are doing the sorting. Could you simply put the US into the hash with a key of -2, Canada with -1 and then sort by ID instead? Not having used PHP in anger for 11 years, I don't recall whether it has built-in sorting in its hashes or if you are doing that at the application level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's some sketchy C# (sorry, I haven't actually run this)...&lt;/p&gt;

   // x and y must be transposed, so assume they will be:
   swaps.Add( new KeyValuePair&amp;lt;int,int&amp;gt;(x,y) );
   return 1;
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now apply the swaps, in reverse order, to A:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;swaps.Reverse();
foreach( KeyValuePair&amp;lt;int,int&amp;gt; x in swaps )
{
   int t = A[x.key];
   A[x.key] = A[x.value];
   A[x.value] = t;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

  equivalent. To determine whether two strings are    equivalent, call
  the Equals method."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They suggest using .Equals instead of .CompareTo when looking solely for equality.  I am not sure if there is a difference between .Equals and == for the string class.  I will sometimes use .Equals or Object.ReferenceEquals instead of == for my own classes in case someone comes along at a later time and redefines the == operator for that class.&lt;/p&gt;

You want to be notified, rather than having to poll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually don't think calling GetFocus from OnIdle is that much of a hack - sure it's polling, but it's low-overhead polling without side effects - but if you really want to track this, &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms997537.aspx"&gt;Windows Hooks&lt;/a&gt; are probably your best choice. Specifically you can install a CBT hook (WH_CBT) and listen for the HCBT_SETFOCUS notification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Windows calls the WH_CBT hook with this hook code when Windows is about to set the focus to any window. In the case of thread-specific hooks, the window must belong to the thread. If the filter function returns TRUE, the focus does not change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could also do with with a WH_CALLWNDPROC hook and listen for the WM_SETFOCUS message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on whether you make it a global hook, or app-local, you can track focus across all windows on the system, or only the windows owned by your process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do this because I still code in the flash IDE and its debugger is so very painful to get working most of the time it's easier to just trace variables out, so you can either use that for loop to print the object names of the items currently on your stage, or use a debugger program to find the objects as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have the children and at what index they actually are at within the stage, you can reference them by calling getChildAt(int), you can removeChildAt(int), you can addChildAt(displayObject, int) and swapChildrenAt(int, int). The int in these arguments would represent the index position that was returned by your trace statement and the displayObject would obviously just represent anything you wanted to add to the stage or parent DisplayObject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using those 4 commands you should be able to freely re-arrange any movieclips you have on stage so that they will appear to transition seamlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

You'll have to see what, in particular, bounds the quality of your data.  Here are basic descriptions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between any two points in your data, (x(0),y(0)) and (x(n),y(n)), add up y(i+1)-y(i) for 0 &amp;lt;= i &amp;lt; n and call this T ("travel") and set R ("rise") to y(n)- y(0) + k for suitably small k.  T/R &gt; 1 indicates a peak.  This works OK if large travel due to noise is unlikely or if noise distributes symmetrically around a base curve shape.  For your application, accept the earliest peak with a score above a given threshold, or analyze the curve of travel per rise values for more interesting properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use matched filters to score similarity to a standard peak shape (essentially, use a normalized dot-product against some shape to get a cosine-metric of similarity)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deconvolve against a standard peak shape and check for high values (though I often find 2 to be less sensitive to noise for simple instrumentation output).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smooth the data and check for triplets of equally spaced points where, if x0 &amp;lt; x1 &amp;lt; x2, y1 &gt; 0.5*(y0+y2), or check Euclidean distances like this:  D((x0,y0),(x1,y1)) + D((x1,y1),(x2,y2)) &gt; D((x0,y0),(x2,y2)), which relies on the triangle inequality.  Using simple ratios will again provide you a scoring mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fit a very simple 2-gaussian mixture model to your data (for example, Numerical Recipes has a nice ready-made chunk of code).  Take the earlier peak.  This will deal correctly with overlapping peaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find the best match in the data to a simple Gaussian, Cauchy, Poisson, or what-have-you curve.  Evaluate this curve over a broad range and subtract it from a copy of the data after noting it's peak location.  Repeat.  Take the earliest peak whose model parameters (standard deviation probably, but some applications might care about kurtosis or other features) meet some criterion.  Watch out for artifacts left behind when peaks are subtracted from the data.
Best match might be determined by the kind of match scoring suggested in #2 above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've done what you're doing before:  finding peaks in DNA sequence data, finding peaks in derivatives estimated from measured curves, and finding peaks in histograms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to attend carefully to proper baselining.  Wiener filtering or other filtering or simple histogram analysis is often an easy way to baseline in the presence of noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if your data is typically noisy and you're getting data off the card as unreferenced single-ended output (or even referenced, just not differential), and if you're averaging lots of observations into each data point, try sorting those observations and throwing away the first and last quartile and averaging what remains.  There are a host of such outlier elimination tactics that can be really useful.&lt;/p&gt;

I believe it--my code is difficult to test right now.  So how do I avoid global state?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest things I use global state (as I understand it) for is managing key pieces of information between our development, acceptance, and production environments.  For example, I have a static class named "Globals" with a static member called "DBConnectionString."  When the application loads, it determines which connection string to load, and populates Globals.DBConnectionString.  I load file paths, server names, and other information in the Globals class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of my functions rely on the global variables.  So, when I test my functions, I have to remember to set certain globals first or else the tests will fail.  I'd like to avoid this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stringValue.CompareTo(otherStringValue):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;null comes before a string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it uses CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.CompareInfo.Compare, which means it will use a culture-dependant comparison. This might mean that  will compare equal to SS in Germany, or similar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stringValue.Equals(otherStringValue):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;null is not considered equal to anything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unless you specify a StringComparison option, it will use what looks like a direct ordinal equality check, ie.  is not the same as SS, in any language or culture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stringValue == otherStringValue:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is not the same as stringValue.Equals().&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The == operator calls the static Equals(string a, string b) method (which in turn goes to an internal EqualsHelper to do the comparison.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calling .Equals() on a null string gets null reference exception, while on == does not. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Object.ReferenceEquals(stringValue, otherStringValue):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just checks that references are the same, ie. it isn't just two strings with the same contents, you're comparing a string object with itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that with the options above that use method calls, there are overloads with more options to specify how to compare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's hard to avoid some global state, but the best way to do this is to use factory classes at the highest level of your application, and everything below that very top level is based on dependency injection.&lt;/p&gt;

Usually these limit are around 2MB, meaning that your files must be smaller than 2MB. Of course you could increase this limit, but the whole process is rather inefficient, since for example to insert a file you would have to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the entire file into memory&lt;/li&gt;

In summary, I have a special case of a URL where, when a form is POSTed to it, I can't rely on cookies for authentication or to maintain the user's session, but I somehow need to know who they are, and I need to know they're logged in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I came up with a solution to my problem, but it needs fleshing out. Here's what I'm thinking. I create a hidden form field called "username", and place within it the user's username, encrypted. Then, when the form POSTs, even though I don't receive any cookies from the browser, I know they're logged in because I can decrypt the hidden form  field and get the username.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major security flaw I can see is replay attacks. How do I prevent someone from getting ahold of that encrypted string, and POSTing as that user? I know I can use SSL to make it harder to steal that string, and maybe I can rotate the encryption key on a regular basis to limit the amount of time that the string is good for, but I'd really like to find a bulletproof solution. Anybody have any ideas? Does the ASP.Net ViewState prevent replay? If so, how do they do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;: I'm hoping for a solution that doesn't require anything stored in a database. Application state would be okay, except that it won't survive an IIS restart or work at all in a web farm or garden scenario. I'm accepting Chris's answer, for now, because I'm not convinced it's even possible to secure this without a database. But if someone comes up with an answer that does not involve the database, I'll accept it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short answer: make sure your application is a function from ALL its inputs (including implicit ones) to its outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem you're describing doesn't seem like global state. At least not mutable state. Rather, what you're describing seems like what is often referred to as "The Configuration Problem", and it has a number of solutions. If you're using Java, you may want to look into light-weight injection frameworks like &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Guice&lt;/a&gt;. In Scala, this is usually solved with &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=scala+implicits" rel="nofollow"&gt;implicits&lt;/a&gt;. In some languages, you will be able to load another program to configure your program at runtime. This is how we used to configure servers written in Smalltalk, and I use a window manager written in Haskell called Xmonad whose configuration file is just another Haskell program.&lt;/p&gt;

You can create your application easily, like HTML site or something like that, and after the last link or last page, however you decide to do you could execute a script with some command-line burner that would erase the rewritable media, or even write an ISO that you keep in CD with a text file or a flash that explains that the CD is lost forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give a look at some Command Line Burners. Linux have several, that isn't worth to mention here, for windows you can use &lt;a href="http://www.google.com.br/search?rlz=1C1GGLS_pt-BRBR291&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;q=Cheetah+CommandLine+Burner" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cheetah CommandLine Burner among several others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The explanation is this: let's say you want a number between 2.5 and 4.5.  The range is 2.0 (4.5 - 2.5).  &lt;code&gt;NextDouble&lt;/code&gt; only returns a number between 0 and 1.0, but if you multiply this by the range you will get a number between 0 and &lt;em&gt;range&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this would give us random doubles between 0.0 and 2.0:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;rng.NextDouble() * 2.0&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, we want them between 2.5 and 4.5!  How do we do this?  Add the smallest number, 2.5:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;2.5 + rng.NextDouble() * 2.0&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we get a number between 0.0 and 2.0; if you add 2.5 to each of these values we see that the range is now between 2.5 and 4.5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first I thought that it mattered if b &gt; a or a &gt; b, but if you work it out both ways you'll find it works out identically so long as you don't mess up the order of the variables used.  I like to express it with longer variable names so I don't get mixed up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;double NextDouble(Random rng, double min, double max)
{
    return min + (rng.NextDouble() * (max - min));
}&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows message-style async, as available through WSAAsyncSelect, is indeed largely a workaround for lack of a proper threading model in Win 3.x days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.NET Begin/End, however, is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; using extra threads. Instead, it is using overlapped I/O, using the extra argument on WSASend / WSARecv, specifically the overlapped completion routine, to specify the continuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that the .NET style harnesses the Windows OS's async I/O support to &lt;strong&gt;avoid&lt;/strong&gt; burning a thread by blocking on a socket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since threads are generally speaking expensive (unless you specify a very small stack size to CreateThread), having threads blocking on sockets will stop you from scaling to 10,000s of concurrent connections.&lt;/p&gt;

Integration tests require some preliminary setup whereas unit tests should be able to run independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could look into the use of a dependency injection framework such as Castle Windsor but for simple cases you may be able to take a middle of the road approach such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public interface ISettingsProvider

    string ConnectionString { get; }

public class TestSettings : ISettingsProvider

&lt;p&gt;Auditing, or business logic logging&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Log those things that are required to be logged.  This comes from the application requirements, and may include logging every change made to any database (as in many financial applications) or logging accesses to data (as may be required in the health industry to meet industry regulations)&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;As this is part of the program requirements many do not include it in their general discussions of logging, however there is overlap in these areas, and for some applications it is useful to consider all logging activities together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Program logging&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Messages which will help developers test and debug the application, and more easily follow the data flow and program logic to understand where implementation, integration, and other errors may exist.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;In general this logging is turned on and off as needed for debugging sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performance logging&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Add later logging as needed to find and resolve performance bottlenecks and other program issues which aren't causing the program to fail, but will lead to better operation.  Overlaps with Program logging in the case of memory leaks and some non-critical errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security logging&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Logging user actions and interactions with external systems where security is a concern.  Useful for determining how an attacker broke a system after an attack, but may also tie into an intrusion detection system to detect new or ongoing attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often try to only add logging in critical places where what I am logging should very rarely hit, otherwise you get the problem like he mentioned of logs that grow way too big... this is why logging error cases is the ideal thing to always log (and it's great to be able to see when these error cases are actually being hit so you can inspect the problem further).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other good things to log are if you have assertions, and your assertions fail, then log it... such as, this query should be under 10 results, if it is bigger there may be a problem, so log it.  Of course, if a log statement ends up filling the logs, it is probably a hint to either put it to some sort of "debug" level, or to adjust or remove the log statement.  If the logs grow too big, you will often end up ignoring them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At the time when octal originally
  became widely used in computing,
  systems such as the IBM mainframes
  employed 24-bit (or 36-bit) words.
  Octal was an ideal abbreviation of
  binary for these machines because
  eight (or twelve) digits could
  concisely display an entire machine
  word (each octal digit covering three
  binary digits). It also cut costs by
  allowing Nixie tubes, seven-segment
  displays, and calculators to be used
  for the operator consoles; where
  binary displays were too complex to
  use, decimal displays needed complex
  hardware to convert radixes, and
  hexadecimal displays needed to display
  letters. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;All modern computing
  platforms, however, use 16-, 32-, or
  64-bit words, with eight bits making
  up a byte. On such systems three octal
  digits would be required, with the
  most significant octal digit
  inelegantly representing only two
  binary digits (and in a series the
  same octal digit would represent one
  binary digit from the next byte).
  Hence hexadecimal is more commonly
  used in programming languages today,
  since a hexadecimal digit covers four
  binary digits and all modern computing
  platforms have machine words that are
  evenly divisible by four. Some
  platforms with a power-of-two word
  size still have instruction subwords
  that are more easily understood if
  displayed in octal; this includes the
  PDP-11. The modern-day ubiquitous x86
  architecture belongs to this category
  as well, but octal is almost never
  used on this platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With a source file, there is a specification that goes in to great detail as to the syntax and semantics, while XML is &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be self-describing.

&lt;p&gt;Some of the things that don't necessarily jump out from Paul's presentation, however, are that he specified -Xss:48k to the JVM on startup, and that he's assuming that the JVM's NIO implementation is efficient in order for it to be a valid comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indy does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; specify a similarly shrunken and tightly constrained stack size. There are no calls to BeginThread (the Delphi RTL thread creation routine, which you should use for such situations) or CreateThread (the raw WinAPI call) in the Indy codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default stack size is stored in the PE, and for the Delphi compiler it defaults to 1MB of reserved address space (space is committed page by page by the OS in 4K chunks; in fact, the compiler needs to generate code to touch pages if there are &gt;4K of locals in a function, because the extension is controlled by page faults, but only for the lowest (guard) page in the stack). That means you're going to run out of address space after max 2,000 concurrent threads handling connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you can change the default stack size in the PE using the {$M minStackSize [,maxStackSize]} directive, but that will affect &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; threads, including the main thread. I hope you don't do much recursion, because 48K or (similar) isn't a lot of space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, whether Paul is right about non-performance of async I/O for Windows in particular, I'm not 100% sure - I'd have to measure it to be certain. What I do know, however, is that arguments about threaded programming being easier than async event-based programming, are presenting a &lt;strong&gt;false dichotomy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Async code doesn't &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; to be event-based; it can be continuation-based, like it is in .NET, and if you specify a closure as your continuation, you get state maintained for you for free. Moreover, conversion from linear thread-style code to continuation-passing-style async code can be made mechanical by a compiler (CPS transform is mechanical), so there need be no cost in code clarity either.&lt;/p&gt;

The only time this changes is at either ends of the paging range {Pc &amp;lt; P3 or Pc &gt; (Pn-3)}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first step is to obviously work out the number of pages:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;numPages = ceiling(totalRecords / numPerPage)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've got 4 or less, the drop out at this point, because, by the above rules, the paging is always going to be fixed (P1, P2, Pn-1, Pn), where one will acutally be Pc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;else, you have three "states"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. (Pc &amp;lt; P3) - so show P1, P2, P3, Pn, Next  If Pc &gt;1, show a 'prev' link before P1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. (Pc &gt; Pn - 2), so show Prev, P1, Pn - 2, Pn -1, Pn, show a Next link if Pc &amp;lt; Pn&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c. Show Prev, P1, Pc -1, Pc, Pc +1, Pn, Next&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy as Pie in pseudo code.  The loops can get a bit nasty when implemented as you've got to do some iterating in order to generate the links.&lt;/p&gt;

Of course Prev and Next are identical to Pc +/- 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;shorter schedule (another shade of #1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more apt for meeting process requirements (like software requirements traceability, or build reproducibility, etc).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to watch out for is that it's too easy for a developer to convince themselves that it would be beneficial to make the change without first going through the basic business filters.  Once that happens, you end up with developers who are unhappy with their tools and are doubly frustrated because they think management won't listen.  If you can't check off one of the things above, them you'll have no chance of persuading management of anything (unless management is incompetent, but that's for another question).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If you're sticking with XP (good choice BTW), you might want to give VirtualBox a try.  It's VERY zippy.  However, it chokes on Vista.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have a thought about trying Parallels ... DON'T!!!  It worked well enough for a while but eventually became very unstable, crashing often when host files were accessed and freezing 2 out of 3 times during startup.  Also, their implementation of networking is convoluted and difficult to setup if, say, you wanted to browse an Apache site on your host from your guest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you need to resize your image, there's a good tutorial for Parallels using GParted and Partition Magic.  I'm sure it would be simple to adapt it to VMWare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your use of SVN is almost exactly what I do (repo is on host, backed up with Time Machine).  However, you could speed it up and remove the bloat of a server if you go with simply a file-based repository.&lt;/li&gt;

At any given time, we have 4-6 different teams that have the ability to add new web sites or services or consume existing services. We probably have about 20-30 different web applications and corresponding services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, given that we have no centralized control over this due to competing priorities, org structures, project timelines, financial buckets, etc., it is quite a mess. We have a variety of services that are reused, but a bunch that are specific to a front-end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally we would have better control over this situation, and we are trying to get control over it, but that is taking a while. One thing we would like to do is find out more about what all of the inter-relationships between web sites and the app servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have used Reflector to find dependencies among assemblies, but would like to be able to see the traffic patterns between services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the options for trying to map out web service relationships? For the most part, we are mainly talking about internal services (web to app, app to app, batch to app, etc.). Off the top of my head, I can think of two ways to approach it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze assemblies for any web references. The drawback here is that not everything is a web reference and I'm not sure how WCF connections are listed. However, this would at least be a start for finding 80% of the connections. Does anyone know of any tools that can do that analysis? Like I said, I've used Reflector for assembly references but can't find anything for web references.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possibly tap into IIS and passively monitor the traffic coming in and out and somehow figure out what is being called and where from. We are looking at enterprise tools that could help but it would be a while before they are implemented (and cost a lot). But is there anything out there that could help out quickly and cheaply? One tool in particular (AmberPoint) can tap into IIS on the servers and monitor inbound and outbound traffic, adds a little special sauce and begin to build a map of the traffic. Very nice, but costs a bundle. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, I know, how the heck did you get into this mess in the first place? Beats me, just trying to help us get control of it and get out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks,

&lt;p&gt;Shelvesets/pacakaged changesets: Allow you to store changesets and send them around for review - ensuring they're production ready before check in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to whether this is an appropriate way to work, we don't allow check-in to main branches without prior review. To pass review your code must pass various automated tools, and then must be acceptable to your peer reviewer. For some definitions of "production ready" - this is it. Therefore, we do something like what you do. However, we use private branches to ensure that check-ins can still be made while this is in progress, and that other check-ins don't have to interfere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If production ready means tested in an integration environment, then it sounds like you may need staging branches or something similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintenance&lt;/strong&gt; - can the other developers (and new developers coming in) maintain the code? They might only be able to program in the language already in use so doing a project in Ruby or Haskell might limit the pool of maintenance engineers to one person - you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interoperability&lt;/strong&gt; - how well can your solution interact with the rest of the codebase? Can you call functions in the legacy code? Can the legacy code call your functions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support&lt;/strong&gt; - your school might have a support contract with Microsoft (though actually I think ASP is no longer supported) or a third party vendor limiting your ability to move to a new system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bringing in new developers&lt;/strong&gt; - if the system you want to move to isn't popular it'll be hard to find developers who are able to do the job meaning the company could get utterly stranded if people left.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Management Will&lt;/strong&gt; - unfortunately there's often a degree of reluctance to any change from management which can stand in the way of innovation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stubborn colleagues&lt;/strong&gt; - you may have some old VBScript holdouts who can't face learning a new system - a lot of the 'other 95%' developers who don't care don't want to make the effort to move to a new system, they may pride themselves on being ASP experts and don't want to lose that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost&lt;/strong&gt; - of course, as you mentioned, it's often not worth it to port vast amounts of code. One other thing to consider as &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Joel Spolsky has highlighted&lt;/a&gt;, is that the legacy code contains a lot of information about customer requirements - it incorporates those hacks that get the system working &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; the way the customers want it, it's been debugged and battle hardened, you're losing a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; moving away from it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically I'd say you have to make a business case for it if you still feel it's the right thing to do, taking all these points in to consideration, find an argument for using language/system x that overcomes them.&lt;/p&gt;

One the the sweet spots of Mule is that it can be embedded within your application and your final artifact can be deployed on Webshpere, WLS, Glassfish etc... without even showing you embeded an ESB. Then this ESB can perform all the integration plumbing (managing connection types and protocols). Whereas some of the end points could be other integration solution you mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;internationalization: they used new terminology, rather than using language tied to US legal concepts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;patents: they specifically address patents (including the Microsoft/Novell issue noted in another answer)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tivo-ization: they address the restrictions (like Tivos) in consumer products that take away, though hardware, the ability to modify the software&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;DRM: they address digital rights management (which they call digital restrictions management)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;compatibility: they addressed compatibility with some other open source licenses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;termination: they addressed specifically what happens if the license is violated and the cure of violations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with the comment about consulting a lawyer (one who knows about software license issues, though). In doing these things (and more), they more than doubled the length of the GPL.  GPL 3 is many things, and one of them is that it is a very complex, technical legal document.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In Subversion (and CVS), the repository is first and foremost. In git
  and mercurial there is not really the concept of a repository in the
  same way; here changes are the central theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;+1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hassle in CVS/SVN comes from the fact that these systems do &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;
remember the parenthood of changes.  In Git and Mercurial,
not only can a commit have multiple children, it can also have multiple
parents!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That can easily observed using one of the graphical tools, &lt;code&gt;gitk&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;hg
view&lt;/code&gt;.  In the following example, branch #2 was forked from #1 at
commit A, and has since been merged once (at M, merged with commit B):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;o---A---o---B---o---C         (branch #1)
     \       \
      o---o---M---X---?       (branch #2)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note how A and B have two children, whereas M has two &lt;strong&gt;parents&lt;/strong&gt;.  These
relationships are &lt;em&gt;recorded&lt;/em&gt; in the repository.  Let's say the maintainer of
branch #2 now wants to merge the latest changes from branch #1, they can
issue a command such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git merge branch-1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the tool will automatically know that the &lt;em&gt;base&lt;/em&gt; is B--because it
was recorded in commit M, an ancestor of the tip of #2--and
that it has to merge whatever happened
between B and C.  CVS does not record this information, nor did SVN prior to
version 1.5.  In these systems, the graph
would look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;o---A---o---B---o---C         (branch #1)
     \    
      o---o---M---X---?       (branch #2)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where M is just a gigantic "squashed" commit of everything that happened between A and B,
applied on top of M.  Note that after the deed is done, there is &lt;em&gt;no trace
left&lt;/em&gt; (except potentially in human-readable comments) of where M did
originate from, nor of &lt;em&gt;how many&lt;/em&gt; commits were collapsed together--making
history much more impenetrable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse still, performing a second merge becomes a nightmare: one has to figure out
what the merge base was at the time of the first merge (and one &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt;
that there has been a merge in the first place!), then
present that information to the tool so that it does not try to replay A..B on
top of M.  All of this is difficult enough when working in close collaboration, but is
simply impossible in a distributed environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A (related) problem is that there is no way to answer the question: "does X
contain B?" where B is a
potentially important bug fix.  So, why not just record that information in the commit, since
it is &lt;em&gt;known&lt;/em&gt; at merge time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.-S. -- I have no experience with SVN 1.5+ merge recording abilities, but the workflow seems to be much more
contrived than in the distributed systems.  If that is indeed the case, it's probably because--as mentioned
in the above comment--the focus is put on repository organization rather than on the changes themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

I've had more luck than xanadont with external drives, running a couple of different brands on Firewire 400 and finding them to be fine with 16-20Gb VMs. If I'm going to be in one place for a few days (either in the office on the iMac or on the road with the MBP) then I'll copy the VM to the local drive but as a rule it's worked fine for about 2 years now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with Parallels, but there came a point when they started releasing versions that hadn't been regression tested, and sometimes basic stuff would suddenly be broken in the current release. Simple fix, stop downloading the new version and stay 3-6 months behind everyone else. Then I needed to give a VM to a colleague and had to go through a few hoops getting it out of Parallels and into VMware. At that point I tried the Fusion beta, had first-hand experience of moving a VM between Mac and Windows (with no real fuss at all) and that persuaded me to switch to Fusion. I have to say, Fusion is an excellent, stable, reliable tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I run WInXP Pro SP 3, Delphi 7, Delphi 2007, SQL Express and various development tools on my VMs (I tend to have a VM for each of my clients).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I agree with xanadont about the 1Gig ram thing - mine tend to have a gig and no more - I didn't see any real change in behaviour/performance with &gt;1Gb in the vm, so it's better off given to the host operating system rather than the virtual one.&lt;/p&gt;

This seems to put Ruby alone the world of languages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All methods need &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; (like Perl, and I think Javascript)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No methods require &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; is (C#, Java)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only setters need &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; (Ruby?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best comparison is C# vs Ruby, because both languages support accessor methods which work syntactically just like class instance variables: &lt;code&gt;foo.x = y&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;y = foo.x&lt;/code&gt; . C# calls them properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a simple example; the same program in Ruby then C#:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class A
  def qwerty; @q; end                   # manual getter
  def qwerty=(value); @q = value; end   # manual setter, but attr_accessor is same 
  def asdf; self.qwerty = 4; end        # "self." is necessary in ruby?
  def xxx; asdf; end                    # we can invoke nonsetters w/o "self."
  def dump; puts "qwerty = #{qwerty}"; end
end

a = A.new
a.xxx
a.dump
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;take away the &lt;code&gt;self.qwerty =()&lt;/code&gt; and it fails (Ruby 1.8.6 on Linux &amp;amp; OS X).  Now C#:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;using System;

public class A {
  public A() {}
  int q;
  public int qwerty {
    get { return q; }
    set { q = value; }
  }
  public void asdf() { qwerty = 4; } // C# setters work w/o "this."
  public void xxx()  { asdf(); }     // are just like other methods
  public void dump() { Console.WriteLine("qwerty = {0}", qwerty); }
}

public class Test {
  public static void Main() {
    A a = new A();
    a.xxx();
    a.dump();
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question: Is this true?  Are there other occasions besides setters where self is necessary? I.e., are there other occasions where a Ruby method &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; be invoked &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; self?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are certainly lots of cases where self &lt;em&gt;becomes&lt;/em&gt; necessary.  This is not unique to Ruby, just to be clear:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;using System;

public class A {
  public A() {}
  public int test { get { return 4; }}
  public int useVariable() {
    int test = 5;
    return test;
  }
  public int useMethod() {
    int test = 5;
    return this.test;
  }
}

public class Test {
  public static void Main() {
    A a = new A();
    Console.WriteLine("{0}", a.useVariable()); // prints 5
    Console.WriteLine("{0}", a.useMethod());   // prints 4
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same ambiguity is resolved in same way.  But while subtle I'm asking about the case where &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A method &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; been defined, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt; local variable has been defined, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we encounter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;qwerty = 4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which is ambiguousis this a method invocation or an new local variable assignment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Mike Stone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi!  I understand and appreciate the points you've made and your 
example was great.  Believe me when I say, if I had enough reputation,
I'd vote up your response.  Yet we still disagree: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on a matter of semantics, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on a central point of fact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I claim, not without irony, we're having a semantic debate about the 
meaning of 'ambiguity'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to parsing and programming language semantics (the subject 
of this question), surely you would admit a broad spectrum of the notion 
'ambiguity'.  Let's just adopt some random notation: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ambiguous: lexical ambiguity (lex must 'look ahead')&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ambiguous: grammatical ambiguity (yacc must defer to parse-tree analysis)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AMBIGUOUS: ambiguity knowing everything at the moment of execution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(and there's junk between 2-3 too).  All these categories are resolved by 
gathering more contextual info, looking more and more globally.  So when you 
say,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"qwerty = 4" is UNAMBIGUOUS in C#
  when there is no variable defined...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn't agree more.  But by the same token, I'm saying &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"qwerty = 4" is un-Ambiguous in ruby
  (as it now exists)&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"qwerty = 4" is Ambiguous in C#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we're not yet contradicting each other.  Finally, here's where we really 
disagree: Either ruby could or could not be implemented without any further 
language constructs such that,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For "qwerty = 4," ruby UNAMBIGUOUSLY
  invokes an existing setter if there&lt;br&gt;
  is no local variable defined&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You say no.  I say yes; another ruby could exist which behaves exactly like 
the current in every respect, &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; "qwerty = 4" defines a new 
variable when no setter and no local exists, it invokes the setter if one 
exists, and it assigns to the local if one exists.  I fully accept that I 
could be wrong.  In fact, a reason why I might be wrong would be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you are writing a new OO language with accessor methods looking
like instances vars (like ruby &amp;amp; C#).  You'd probably start with 
conceptual grammars something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  var = expr    // assignment
  method = expr // setter method invocation
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the parser-compiler (not even the runtime) will puke, because even after
all the input is grokked there's no way to know which grammar is pertinent.
You're faced which a classic choice.  I can't be sure of the details, but
basically ruby does this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  var = expr    // assignment (new or existing)
  // method = expr, disallow setter method invocation without .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that is why it's un-Ambiguous, while and C# does this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  symbol = expr // push 'symbol=' onto parse tree and decide later
                // if local variable is def'd somewhere in scope: assignment
                // else if a setter is def'd in scope: invocation
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For C#, 'later' is still at compile time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sure ruby could do the same, but 'later' would have to be at runtime, because 
as ben points out you don't know until the statement is executed which case 
applies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question was never intended to mean "do I really need the 'self.'?" or "what 
potential ambiguity is being avoided?"  Rather I wanted to know why was this
particular choice made?  Maybe it's not performance.  Maybe it just got the job
done, or it was considered best to always allow a 1-liner local to override a 
method (a pretty rare case requirement) ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I'm sort of suggesting that the most dynamical language might be the one which
postpones this decision the longest, and chooses semantics based on the most contextual 
info: so if you have no local and you defined a setter, it would use the setter.  Isn't 
this why we like ruby, smalltalk, objc, because method invocation is decided at runtime,
offering maximum expressiveness?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Without profiling we cannot tell which bit of the program needs optimizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were in a large system, then one would use a profiler to find that the prime number generator is the part that needs optimizing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Profiling a loop with a dozen or so instructions in it is not usually worth while - the overhead of the profiler is significant compared to the loop body, and about the only ways to improve a loop that small is to change the algorithm to do fewer iterations. So IME, once you've eliminated any expensive functions and have a known target of a few lines of simple code, you're better off changing the algorithm and timing an end-to-end run than trying to improve the code by instruction level profiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If new technology is worth implementing then you will need to propose this solution with tangible results.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.headius.com/2008/02/rubys-threadraise-threadkill-timeoutrb.html"&gt;This article talks about ruby's timeout library.&lt;/a&gt; which throws exceptions across threads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It explains how doing such a thing is fundamentally broken. It's not just broken in ruby, it's broken anywhere that throws exceptions across threads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, what can (and does) happen is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ThreadA: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;At some random time, throw an exception on thread B:
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ThreadB:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;try {
    //do stuff
} finally {
    CloseResourceOne();
    // ThreadA's exception gets thrown NOW, in the middle 
    // of our finally block and resource two NEVER gets closed.
    // Obviously this is BAD, and the only way to stop is to NOT throw
    // exceptions across threads
    CloseResourceTwo();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your 'periodic checking' example is fine, as you're not actually throwing exceptions across threads.&lt;br /&gt;
You're just setting a flag which says "throw an exception the next time you look at this flag", which is fine as it doesn't suffer from the "can be thrown in the middle of your catch or finally block" problem.&lt;br /&gt;
However, if you're going to do that, you may as well just be setting an "exitnow" flag, and using that and save yourself the hassle of creating the exception object. A volatile bool will work just fine for that.&lt;/p&gt;

private:
   mydata_collection  myPreciousData;

Ruby resolves this ambiguity by saying it will create a new variable, thus the &lt;code&gt;self.&lt;/code&gt; is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is another case where you need &lt;code&gt;self.&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class A
  def test
    4
  end
  def use_variable
    test = 5
    test
  end
  def use_method
    test = 5
    self.test
  end
end
a = A.new
a.use_variable # returns 5
a.use_method   # returns 4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the access to &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt; is ambiguous, so the &lt;code&gt;self.&lt;/code&gt; is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, this is why the C# example is actually not a good comparison, because you define variables in a way that is unambiguous from using the setter. If you had defined a variable in C# that was the same name as the accessor, you would need to qualify calls to the accessor with &lt;code&gt;this.&lt;/code&gt;, just like the Ruby case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your object to support foreach, you &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; have to implement &lt;em&gt;IEnumerable&lt;/em&gt;. I.e. this is not a constraint and it isn't checked by the compiler. What's checked is that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your object provide a public method &lt;em&gt;GetEnumerator&lt;/em&gt; that
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;takes no parameters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;return a type that has two members
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a parameterless &lt;em&gt;method MoveNext&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;em&gt;returns a boolean&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example,  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Foo
{
    public Bar GetEnumerator() { return new Bar(); }

    public struct Bar
    {
        public bool MoveNext()
        {

        public object Current
        {
            get { return null; }
        }
    }
}

// the following complies just fine:
Foo f = new Foo();
foreach (object o in f)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Krzysztof Cwalina's da man!");

It seems that the field general purpose GPU programming (GPGPU) has a large bias towards scientific applications with a lot of heavy math as this fits well with the GPU computational model. This is all good and well, but most people don't spend all their time running simulation software and the like so we figured it might be possible to create a common foundation for easily building GPU-enabled software for the masses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads to the question I would like to pose; What are the most common types of work performed by programs? It is not a requirement that the work translates extremely well to GPU programming as we are willing to accept modest performance improvements (Better little than nothing, right?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of subjects we have in mind already:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data management - Manipulation of large amounts of data from databases
and otherwise.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spreadsheet type programs (Is somewhat related to the above).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GUI programming (Though it might be impossible to get access to the
relevant code).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common algorithms like sorting and searching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common collections (And integrating them with data manipulation
algorithms)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which other coding tasks are very common? I suspect a lot of the code being written is of the category of inventory management and otherwise tracking of real 'objects'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have no industry experience I figured there might be a number of basic types of code which is done more often than I realize but which just doesn't materialize as external products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both high level programming tasks as well as specific low level operations will be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider your design. Does the caller really need to see the internal array? Can you restructure the code so that the caller tells object what to do with the array? E.g., if the caller intends to search the array, could the owner object do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could pass a reference to result vector to the function. On some compilers that may result in marginally faster code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, you could just return a const refererence to whatever your data container is, like suggested above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const std::vector&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;amp; getData() { return mData; }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has the disadvantage of concreteness: you can't change how you store the data internally without changing the interface of your class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, you can return const-ed pointers to the actual data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const T* getDataAt(size_t index)
{
   return &amp;amp;mData[index];
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a bit nicer, but also requires that you provide a getNumItems call, and protect against out-of-bounds indices. Also, the const-ness of your pointers is easily cast away, and your data is now read-write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option is to provide a pair of iterators, which is a bit more complex. This has the same advantages of pointers, as well as not (necessarily) needing to provide a getNumItems call, and there's considerably more work involved to strip the iterators of their const-ness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the easiest way to manage this is by using a Boost Range:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;typedef vector&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;::const_iterator range_iterator_type;
boost::iterator_range&amp;lt; range_iterator_type &amp;gt;&amp;amp; getDataRange()
{
    return boost::iterator_range(mData.begin(), mData.end());
}

We often have to pass information entered into our system by users to these tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this is a big security nightmare waiting to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we've not yet found any classes in the .NET Framework that execute command line programs while providing the same kind of guards against injection attacks as the IDbCommand objects do for databases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, we're using a very primitive string substitution which I suspect is rather insufficient:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;protected virtual string Escape(string value)
{
      return value
        .Replace(@"\", @"\\")
        .Replace(@"$", @"\$")
        .Replace(@"""", @"\""")
        .Replace("`", "'")
      ;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you guys do to prevent command-line injection attacks?  We're planning to implement a regex that is very strict and only allows a very small subset of characters through, but I was wondering if there was a better way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some clarifications:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of these tools do not have APIs we can program against.  If they did, we wouldn't be having this problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The users don't pick tools to execute, they enter meta-data which the tools we've chosen use (for example, injecting meta data such as copyright notices into target files). &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Index all columns you are going to join tables on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specify the fields you are actually going to retrieve, rather than "SELECT * FROM..."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use SQL aggregate functions rather than rolling your own. Common mistake: Opening a recordset and using a "Count" property of the recordset, rather than using "SELECT COUNT(*)..."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;General programming translates terribly to GPUs. GPUs are dedicated to performing fairly simple tasks on streams of data at a massive rate, with massive parallelism. They do not deal well with the rich data and control structures of general programming, and there's no point trying to shoehorn that into them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn't too far away from my impression of the situation but at this point we are not concerning ourselves too much with that. We are starting out by getting a broad picture of which options we have to focus on. After that is done we will analyse them a bit deeper and find out which, if any, are plausible options. If we end up determining that it is impossible to do anything within the field, and we are only increasing everybody's electricity bill then that is a valid result as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The public names defined by a module are determined by checking the module's namespace for a variable named &lt;code&gt;__all__&lt;/code&gt;; if defined, it must be a sequence of strings which are names defined or imported by that module. The names given in &lt;code&gt;__all__&lt;/code&gt; are all considered public and are required to exist. If &lt;code&gt;__all__&lt;/code&gt; is not defined, the set of public names includes all names found in the module's namespace which do not begin with an underscore character ("_"). &lt;code&gt;__all__&lt;/code&gt; should contain the entire public API. It is intended to avoid accidentally exporting items that are not part of the API (such as library modules which were imported and used within the module).&lt;/p&gt;

First, let's check out how Stack Overflow handles normal cases and edge cases.  Each of my pages displays 10 results, so to find out what it does for 1 page, find a tag that has less than 11 entries: &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/usability"&gt;usability&lt;/a&gt; works today.  We can see nothing is displayed, which makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about 2 pages?  Find a tag that has between 11 and 20 entries (&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/emacs"&gt;emacs&lt;/a&gt; works today).  We see: "&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; 2 Next" or "Prev 1 &lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;", depending on which page we're on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 pages? "&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; 2 3 ... 3 Next", "Prev 1 &lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; 3 Next", and "Prev 1 ... 2 &lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;".  Interestingly, we can see that Stack Overflow itself doesn't handle this edge case very well: it should display "&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; 2 ... 3 Next"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 pages? "&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; 2 3 ... 4 Next", "Prev 1 &lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; 3 ... 4 Next", "Prev 1 ... 2 &lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; 4 Next" and "Prev 1 ... 3 &lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally let's look at the general case, N pages:  "&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; 2 3 ... N Next", "Prev 1 &lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; 3 ... N Next", "Prev 1 ... 2 &lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; 4 ... N Next", "Prev 1 ... 3 &lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt; 5 ... N Next", etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's generalize based on what we've seen:
  The algorithm seems to have these traits in common:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we're not on the first page, display link to Prev&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always display the first page number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always display the current page number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always display the page before this page, and the page after this page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always display the last page number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we're not on the last page, display link to Next&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's ignore the edge case of a single page and make a good first attempt at the algorithm:  (As has been mentioned, the code to actually print out the links would be more complicated.  Imagine each place we place a page number, Prev or Next as a function call that will return the correct URL.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function printPageLinksFirstTry(num totalPages, num currentPage)
  if ( currentPage &amp;gt; 1 )
    print "Prev"
  print "1"
  print "..."
  print currentPage - 1
  print currentPage
  print currentPage + 1
  print "..."
  print totalPages
  if ( currentPage &amp;lt; totalPages )
    print "Next"
endFunction
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This function works ok, but it doesn't take into account whether we're near the first or last page.  Looking at the above examples, we only want to display the ... if the current page is two or more away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function printPageLinksHandleCloseToEnds(num totalPages, num currentPage)
  if ( currentPage &amp;gt; 1 )
    print "Prev"
  print "1"
  if ( currentPage &amp;gt; 2 )
    print "..."
  if ( currentPage &amp;gt; 2 )
    print currentPage - 1
  print currentPage
  if ( currentPage &amp;lt; totalPages - 1 )
    print currentPage + 1
  if ( currentPage &amp;lt; totalPages - 1 )
    print "..."
  print totalPages
  if ( currentPage &amp;lt; totalPages )
    print "Next"
endFunction
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we have some duplication here.  We can go ahead and clean that up for readibility:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function printPageLinksCleanedUp(num totalPages, num currentPage)
  if ( currentPage &amp;gt; 1 )
    print "Prev"
  print "1"
  if ( currentPage &amp;gt; 2 )
    print "..."
    print currentPage - 1
  print currentPage
  if ( currentPage &amp;lt; totalPages - 1 )
    print currentPage + 1
    print "..."
  print totalPages
  if ( currentPage &amp;lt; totalPages )
    print "Next"
endFunction
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are only two problems left.  First, we don't print out correctly for one page, and secondly, we'll print out "1" twice if we're on the first or last page.  Let's clean those both up in one go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function printPageLinksFinal(num totalPages, num currentPage)
  if ( totalPages == 1 )
    return

  if ( currentPage &amp;gt; 1 )
    print "Prev"

  print "1"

  if ( currentPage &amp;gt; 2 )
    print "..."
    print currentPage - 1

  if ( currentPage != 1 and currentPage != totalPages )
    print currentPage

  if ( currentPage &amp;lt; totalPages - 1 )
    print currentPage + 1
    print "..."

  print totalPages

  if ( currentPage &amp;lt; totalPages )
    print "Next"

endFunction
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, I lied: We have one remaining issue.  When you have at least 4 pages and are on the first or last page, you get an extra page in your display.  Instead of "&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; 2 ... 10 Next" you get "&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; 2 3 ... 10 Next".  To match what's going on at Stack Overflow exactly, you'll have to check for this situation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function printPageLinksFinalReally(num totalPages, num currentPage)
  if ( totalPages == 1 )
    return

  if ( currentPage &amp;gt; 1 )
    print "Prev"

  print "1"

  if ( currentPage &amp;gt; 2 )
    print "..."
    if ( currentPage == totalPages and totalPages &amp;gt; 3 )
      print currentPage - 2
    print currentPage - 1

  if ( currentPage != 1 and currentPage != totalPages )
    print currentPage

  if ( currentPage &amp;lt; totalPages - 1 )
    print currentPage + 1
    if ( currentPage == 1 and totalPages &amp;gt; 3 )
      print currentPage + 2
    print "..."

  print totalPages

  if ( currentPage &amp;lt; totalPages )
    print "Next"

endFunction
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I take your point about an exception being thrown in the finally block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I think there is a way - using yet another thread - of using this exception-as-interrupt idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thread A:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;At some random time, throw an exception on thread C:
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thread B:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;try {
    Signal thread C that exceptions may be thrown
    //do stuff, without needing to check exit conditions
    Signal thread C that exceptions may no longer be thrown
}
catch {
    // exception/interrupt occurred handle...
}
finally {
    // ...and clean up
    CloseResourceOne();
    CloseResourceTwo();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thread C:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; while(thread-B-wants-exceptions) {
        try {
            Thread.Sleep(1) 
        }
        catch {
            // exception was thrown...
            if Thread B still wants to handle exceptions
                throw-in-B
        }
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or is that just silly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boost.ptr_container library provides polymorphic value semantic versions of the standard containers. You only have to pass in a pointer to a heap-allocated object, and the container will take ownership and all further operations will provide value semantics , except for reclaiming ownership, which gives you almost all the benefits of value semantics by using a smart pointer.&lt;/p&gt;

It's irresponsible to both current and future developers,  as well as to the business to continue to write programs in a language that has been declared dead for 7 or 8 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legacy or extensions to existing code are one thing - but continuing to churn out new code  because you don't want to take the initial hit in time or money to train your devs in "new" technology is a good way to saddle yourself with an unmaintainable codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officially, the ASP runtime (ASP.DLL) should be supported until somewhere around 2018. But, that doesn't mean it will be included or an option in Windows/IIS for each version above that. AAMOF, including it in the next Windows version will just increase the support lifetime - which I'm not sure MS wants to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, you'll have the aging Windows 2008 server that you have to keep running for your classic ASP code that no one can maintain or understand. It'll be full of Sql injections, poor coding practices, and unpatched vulnerabilities. Then, a rewrite will finally be ordered, but will fail miserably because no one who developed the original code is still around - so nobody knows what it does. Anyone who worked with custom software on NT 4 (or OS/2) way past its prime will know what I refer to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing to write new code for that platform is a boneheaded move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The newest version of the Microsoft Visual J++ development environment
  supports a language construct called &lt;em&gt;delegates&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;bound method
  references&lt;/em&gt;. This construct, and the new keywords &lt;code&gt;delegate&lt;/code&gt; and
  &lt;code&gt;multicast&lt;/code&gt; introduced to support it, are not a part of the Java&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;
  programming language, which is specified by the &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110628230222/http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/j.title.doc.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Java Language
  Specification&lt;/a&gt; and amended by the &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110628230222/http://java.sun.com/products/archive/jdk/1.1/index.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Inner Classes Specification&lt;/a&gt; included
  in the &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110628230222/http://java.sun.com/products/archive/jdk/1.1/index.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;documentation for the JDKTM 1.1 software&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;It is unlikely that the Java programming language will ever include
  this construct. Sun already carefully considered adopting it in 1996,
  to the extent of building and discarding working prototypes. Our
  conclusion was that bound method references are unnecessary and
  detrimental to the language. This decision was made in consultation
  with Borland International, who had previous experience with bound
  method references in Delphi Object Pascal. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;We believe bound method references are &lt;em&gt;unnecessary&lt;/em&gt; because another
  design alternative, &lt;em&gt;inner classes&lt;/em&gt;, provides equal or superior
  functionality. In particular, inner classes fully support the
  requirements of user-interface event handling, and have been used to
  implement a user-interface API at least as comprehensive as the
  Windows Foundation Classes. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;We believe bound method references are &lt;em&gt;harmful&lt;/em&gt; because they detract
  from the simplicity of the Java programming language and the
  pervasively object-oriented character of the APIs. Bound method
  references also introduce irregularity into the language syntax and
  scoping rules. Finally, they dilute the investment in VM technologies
  because VMs are required to handle additional and disparate types of
  references and method linkage efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That is,for example, have a dev version of the code that is where the developers check in code that is in being worked on; then you could have a beta version, where you could add beta fixes to your code; and then a production version.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is obvious overhead in this approach, such as the fact that you will have a larger workspace on you local machine, the fact that you will need need to have a migration process into place to move code from one stage to the next (which means a code freeze when doing the integration testing that goes with the migration), and that depending on the complexity of the project(s) you might need to have tools that change settings, environment variables, registry entries, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
All of this is a pain to set up, but you only do it once, and once you have it all in place, makes working on different stages of the code a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The switch statement is not the same
  thing as a big if-else statement. 
  Each case must be unique and evaluated
  statically.  The switch statement does
  a constant time branch regardless of
  how many cases you have.  The if-else
  statement evaluates each condition
  until it finds one that is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the C# switch statement is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; always a constant time branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases the compiler will use a CIL switch statement which is indeed a constant time branch using a jump table.  However, in sparse cases as pointed out by &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/44905/c-switch-statement-limitations-why#48259"&gt;Ivan Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; the compiler may generate something else entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is actually quite easy to verify by writing various C# switch statements, some sparse, some dense, and looking at the resulting CIL with the ildasm.exe tool.&lt;/p&gt;

What would be perfect in this case for example would be something in Firebug that, when hovering over an element's size in the layout panel would display a tool tip that says something like "width constrained by outer element X; height constrained by style Z on element Q" or "width contributed to by inner elements A, B and C".  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The governing type of a switch statement is established by the switch expression. If the type of the switch expression is sbyte, byte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong, char, string, or an enum-type, then that is the governing type of the switch statement. Otherwise, exactly one user-defined implicit conversion (6.4) must exist from the type of the switch expression to one of the following possible governing types: sbyte, byte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong, char, string. If no such implicit conversion exists, or if more than one such implicit conversion exists, a compile-time error occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be able to achieve the same effect by using reflection to get Method objects you can then invoke, and the other way is to create an interface with a single 'invoke' or 'execute' method, and then instantiate them to call the method your interested in (i.e. using an anonymous inner class).&lt;/p&gt;

elseif (t == typeof(string))
{

&lt;p&gt;But there isn't much gained by that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A case statement on integral types allows the compiler to make a number of optimizations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no duplication (unless you duplicate case labels, which the compiler detects).  In your example t could match multiple types due to inheritance.  Should the first match be executed? All of them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compiler can choose to implement a switch statement over an integral type by a jump table to avoid all the comparisons.  If you are switching on an enumeration that has integer values 0 to 100 then it creates an array with 100 pointers in it, one for each switch statement. At runtime it simply looks up the address from the array based on the integer value being switched on.  This makes for much better runtime performance than performing 100 comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You're going to get better performance if you're using absolute positioning for each control (myNewlyCreatedButton.Location.X/Y) as opposed to using a flow layout panel or a table layout panel. WinForms has to do a lot less math trying to figure out where controls should be placed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is a single operation in which you're adding/removing/modifying a lot of controls, call "SuspendLayout()" on the container of the affected controls (whether it is a panel or the whole form), and when you're done with your work call "ResumeLayout()" on the same panel. If you don't, the form will have to do a layout pass each and every time you add/remove/modify a control, which cost a lot more time.  see: &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.control.suspendlayout(VS.80).aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.control.suspendlayout(VS.80).aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strictly speaking you are absolutely right that there is no reason to put these restrictions on it. One might suspect that the reason is that for the allowed cases the implementation is very efficient (as suggested by Brian Ensink (&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/44905/c-switch-statement-limitations-why#44921" rel="nofollow"&gt;44921&lt;/a&gt;)), but I doubt the implementation is very efficient (w.r.t. if-statements) if I use integers and some random cases (e.g. 345, -4574 and 1234203). And in any case, what is the harm in allowing it for everything (or at least more) and saying that it is only efficient for specific cases (such as (almost) consecutive numbers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can, however, imagine that one might want to exclude types because of reasons such as the one given by lomaxx (&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/44905/c-switch-statement-limitations-why#44918" rel="nofollow"&gt;44918&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

Then, if you can make sure that the strings used in the cases are stored consecutively in memory, you can very efficiently implement the switch (i.e. with execution in the order of 2 compares, an addition and two jumps).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a generic, server-based 'enterprise application' I'd want the bare minimum to be something along these lines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A detailed functional design document (aka spec). Generally something along the lines of Joel s' &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/WhatTimeIsIt.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;WhatsTimeIsIt example spec&lt;/a&gt;, although probably with some UML use-case diagrams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A software techical design document. Not necessarily detailed for 100% system coverage but detailed in all the key areas and containing all the design decisions. Being a bit of an UML freak it'd be nice to see lots of pictures along the lines of package diagrams, component diagrams, key feature class diagrams, and probably some sequence diagrams thrown in for good measure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An infrastructure design document. Probably with UML deployment diagram for the conceptual deisng and perhaps a network diagram for something more physical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I say document any of the above might be broken down into multiple documents, or perhaps stored on a wiki/some other tool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for their usefulness, my philosophy has always been that a development team should always be able to hand over an application to a support team without having to hand over  their phone numbers. If the design artifacts don't clealry indicate what the application does, how it does it, and where it does it then you know the support team are going to give the app the same care and attention they would a rabid dog. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should mention I'm not vindicating the practice of handing software over from a dev team to a support team once it's &lt;em&gt;finished&lt;/em&gt;, which raises all manner of interesting issues, I'm just saying it should be possible if the management so desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you are thinking of the deprecated *= and =* operators vs. "outer join".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have just now tested the two formats given, and they work properly on a SQL Server 2008 database.  In my case they yielded identical execution plans, but I couldn't confidently say that this would always be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would be able to use a monad for file IO to isolate the changing state nature to just the code that used the Monad. The code inside the Monad can effectively ignore the changing state of the world outside the Monad - this makes it a lot easier to reason about the overall effect of your program.&lt;/p&gt;

The issue was that Game had interfaces to various things that SinglePlayer and TwoPlayer needed access to but that we did not want expose outside of the framework classes.  The solution was to make those interfaces private and allow TwoPlayer and SinglePlayer access to them via friendship.  &lt;/p&gt;

Haskell also has lazy evaluation, which is fairly rare amongst functional languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do these things mean? A pure functional language, means there are no side effects (or changes in shared state, when a function is called) which means that you are guaranteed that if you call f(x), nothing else happens besides returning a value from the function, such as console output, database output, changes to global or static variables.. and although Haskell can have non pure functions (through monads), it must be 'explicitly' implied through declaration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pure functional languages and 'No side effect' programming has gained popularity recently as it lends itself well to multi core concurrency, as it is much harder to get wrong with no shared state, rather than myriad locks &amp;amp; semaphores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lazy evaluation is where a function is NOT evaluated until it is absolutely necessary required. meaning that many operation can be avoided when not necessary. Think of this in a basic C# if clause such as this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if(IsSomethingTrue() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; AnotherThingTrue())
{
    do something;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;IsSomethingTrue()&lt;/code&gt; is false then &lt;code&gt;AnotherThingTrue()&lt;/code&gt; method is never evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Haskell is an amazing language, the major benefit of F# (for the time being), is that it sits on top of the CLR. This lends it self to polyglot programming. One day, you may write your web UI in ASP.net MVC, your business logic in C#, your core algorithms in F# and your unit tests in Ironruby....  All amongst the the .Net framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pychecker&lt;/strong&gt;: It crashes frequently, most of the runs I tried resulted in Errors that originated in the pychecker code (eg: AttributeError or IndexError: list index out of range were the most common).  For some reason I had to set the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable before it would even run on any of the app code, and the documentation is very sparse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pyflakes&lt;/strong&gt;: 'pyflakes --help' throws a TypeError -- erm... Documentation is also very sparse, and pyflakes is very forgiving (as far as I can tell, it only reports compile errors, warnings, redefinitions, and some concerns about imports--such as unused and wildcards).  pyflakes also seems to repeat itself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;eventlist/views.py:4: 'Http404' imported but unused&lt;br&gt;
      eventlist/views.py:4: 'Http404' imported but unused&lt;br&gt;
      eventlist/views.py:5: 'from eventlist.models import *' used; unable to detect undefined names
      eventlist/views.py:59: 'authenticate' imported but unused&lt;br&gt;
      eventlist/views.py:61: redefinition of unused 'login' from
  line 59&lt;br&gt;
      eventlist/views.py:5: 'from eventlist.models import *' used;
  unable to detect undefined names &lt;br&gt;
     eventlist/views.py:4: 'Http404' imported but unused&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pylint&lt;/strong&gt;: This seems to be the most capable of the tools suggested.  It has the best documentation.  LogiLab provides a tutorial, pylint has a help screen, and there is a (broken) link to a user manual, which would be extremely helpful.  There are some issues with applying pylint to django, since pylint doesn't know about the django classes (such as models.Model).  This means that a fair number of otherwise valuable errors are generated about missing class fields.  eg:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;E:105:get_events_by_tag: Class 'Tag' has no 'objects' member&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parsing these out automatically will be very difficult without some additional knowledge of the classes in use.  I'm not sure adding that is feasible, but it does seem likely that pylint is capable of dealing with this in the "right" way.  (I probably just need to point it to the django source, but there are no command line params that look likely, and, as mentioned earlier, the user manual is inaccessible.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the moment, I'm still looking into pylint -- pychecker and pyflakes need better documentation and they need to become more robust.&lt;/p&gt;

Hopefully that's right, because the rest of this is based on that assumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basics of is should match with how you create a regular Spring message driven bean.  There is a little bit of documentation on how to do that in the &lt;a href="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/ejb.html#ejb-implementation" rel="nofollow"&gt;Spring Reference Manual&lt;/a&gt;.  Also see the &lt;a href="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/api/org/springframework/ejb/support/AbstractEnterpriseBean.html?is-external=true" rel="nofollow"&gt;AbstractEnterpriseBean Javadoc&lt;/a&gt; for some additional information about how the Spring context is retrieved.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extra configuration required for a WebServiceMessageDrivenBean appear to be a &lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/jms/ConnectionFactory.html?is-external=true" rel="nofollow"&gt;ConnectionFactory&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://static.springframework.org/spring-ws/sites/1.5/apidocs/org/springframework/ws/WebServiceMessageFactory.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;WebServiceMessageFactory&lt;/a&gt;, and your &lt;a href="http://static.springframework.org/spring-ws/sites/1.5/apidocs/org/springframework/ws/transport/WebServiceMessageReceiver.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;WebServiceMessageReceiver&lt;/a&gt;.  These need to use the bean names specified in the Javadoc for the WebServiceMessageDrivenBean.  The bean names are "connectionFactory", "messageFactory", and "messageReceiver" respectively.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a master domain, login.mydomain.com with the script master_login.php that manages the logins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each client domain has the script client_login.php&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the domains have a shared user session database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the client domain requires the user to be logged in, it redirects to the master domain (login.mydomain.com/master_login.php). If the user has not signed in to the master it requests authentication from the user (ie. display login page). After the user is authenticated it creates a session in a database. If the user is already authenticated it looks up their session id in the database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The master domain returns to the client domain (client.mydomain.com/client_login.php) passing the session id.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The client domain creates a cookie storing the session id from the master. The client can find out the logged in user by querying the shared database using the session id.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The session id is a unique global identifier generated with algorithm from RFC 4122&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The master_login.php will only redirect to domains in its whitelist&lt;/li&gt;

I have used Charles to confirm that all of the content -- the HTML, the images, the CSS, the javascript, &lt;strong&gt;everything&lt;/strong&gt; is the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ONLY difference in the traffic is that (because the local site is served from the Django development mode server) the response headers look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Server  WSGIServer/0.1 Python/2.5.2
Date    Thu, 04 Sep 2008 23:56:10 GMT 
Vary    Cookie
Content-Length  2301
Content-Type    text/html; charset=utf-8
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas on the staging server (where Django is running inside Apache) the headers look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date    Thu, 04 Sep 2008 23:56:06 GMT
Server  Apache/2.2.8 (Ubuntu) mod_python/3.3.1 Python/2.5.2 PHP/5.2.4-2ubuntu5 with Suhosin-Patch

Content-Length  2301

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as far as I can tell the only differences are HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/1.0, the server identifer (Apache vs WSGIServer) and the order of the Date/Server headers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To elaborate a bit further on the differences in appearance, basically it appears as if the version of the site on the staging server is "zoomed in" by about 10%.  For example, the primary logo which dominates our home page is 220 pixels wide but when server from our staging server shows up as 245 pixels wide.  Everything else on the page, (other images, text, spacing, etc) is also proportionately larger.&lt;/p&gt;

It is the output of the built-in Date.toString() method (at least in the UK and US locales). Not coincidentally, it is also the format of the unix 'date' command (at least on linux, and I believe in other implementations too) - though to be pedantic, Date.toString() pads one-digit day numbers with a zero while unix date does not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means is that you are likely to receive this input format when you output an unformatted date into a user-modifiable field (e.g. an HTML INPUT field) and receive it back unmodified. So just because input is coming in this format, doesn't mean the users will type in a thousand other arbitrary formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, they still might. The way I handle date inputs in general is with a bunch of try/catch blocks, where I try it against one format, then another, then another.

This is logical, and is what I've always done in the rare situations where a finalizer is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, what happens if I just do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Foo : IDisposable
{
     public void Dispose(){ CloseSomeHandle(); }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and don't implement a finalizer, or anything. Will the framework call the Dispose method for me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes I realise this sounds dumb, and all logic implies that it won't, but I've always had 2 things at the back of my head which have made me unsure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone a few years ago once told me that it would in fact do this, and that person had a very solid track record of "knowing their stuff."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compiler/framework does other 'magic' things depending on what interfaces you implement (eg: foreach, extension methods, serialization based on attributes, etc), so it makes sense that this might be 'magic' too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I've read a lot of stuff about it, and there's been lots of things implied, I've never been able to find a &lt;strong&gt;definitive&lt;/strong&gt; Yes or No answer to this question.&lt;/p&gt;

I've also confirmed that this exception get's thrown with exactly one record in the database (the record I'm attempting to update)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess this is almost a two part question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is the exception being thrown?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After reviewing the second set of generated SQL, it seems like for detecting conflicts it would be nice to check all the fields, but I imagine this would be fairly inefficient.  Is this the way this always works?  Is there a setting to just check the primary key?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the memory pressure of your app, you may not have a gc for that object generation for a while.  So in the case of say, a file stream or a db connection, you may have to wait a while for the unmanaged resource to be freed in the finalizer call for a while, causing some issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a few minutes, so I wrote up a complete code example...I would've before as I always try to show code, but didn't have time.  Anyway, here's the whole thing (minus the designer code).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;namespace AutoComplete
{
    public partial class Main : Form
    {
        //so you don't have to address "txtMain.AutoCompleteCustomSource" every time
        AutoCompleteStringCollection acsc;
        public Main()
        {
            InitializeComponent();

            //Set to use a Custom source
            txtMain.AutoCompleteSource = AutoCompleteSource.CustomSource;
            //Set to show drop down *and* append current suggestion to end
            txtMain.AutoCompleteMode = AutoCompleteMode.SuggestAppend;
            //Init string collection.
            acsc = new AutoCompleteStringCollection();
            //Set txtMain's AutoComplete Source to acsc
            txtMain.AutoCompleteCustomSource = acsc;
        }

        private void txtMain_KeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e)
        {
            if (e.KeyCode == Keys.Enter)
            {
                //Only keep 10 AutoComplete strings
                if (acsc.Count &amp;lt; 10)
                {
                    //Add to collection
                    acsc.Add(txtMain.Text);
                }
                else
                {
                    //remove oldest
                    acsc.RemoveAt(0); 
                    //Add to collection
                    acsc.Add(txtMain.Text);
                }
            }
        }

        private void Main_FormClosed(object sender, FormClosedEventArgs e)
        {
            //open stream to AutoComplete save file
            StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter("AutoComplete.acs");

            //Write AutoCompleteStringCollection to stream
            foreach (string s in acsc)
                sw.WriteLine(s);

            //Flush to file
            sw.Flush();

            //Clean up
            sw.Close();
            sw.Dispose();
        }

        private void Main_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            //open stream to AutoComplete save file
            StreamReader sr = new StreamReader("AutoComplete.acs");

            //initial read
            string line = sr.ReadLine();
            //loop until end
            while (line != null)
            {
                //add to AutoCompleteStringCollection
                acsc.Add(line);
                //read again
                line = sr.ReadLine();
            }

            //Clean up
            sr.Close();
            sr.Dispose();
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This code will work exactly as is, you just need to create the GUI with a TextBox named txtMain and hook up the KeyDown, Closed and Load events to the TextBox and Main form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also note that, for this example and to make it simple, I just chose to detect the Enter key being pressed as my trigger to save the string to the collection.  There is probably more/different events that would be better, depending on your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the model used for populating the collection is not very "smart."  It simply deletes the oldest string when the collection gets to the limit of 10. This is likely not ideal, but works for the example.  You would probably want some sort of rating system (especially if you really want it to be Google-ish)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final note, the suggestions will actually show up in the order they are in the collection.  If for some reason you want them to show up differently, just sort the list however you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps!&lt;/p&gt;

When I seal a class I am trying to say that this class was designed to encapsulate some specific piece of knowledge or some specific service.  It was not meant to be enhanced or subclassed further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This goes well with the Template Method design pattern.  I have an interface that says "I perform this service."  I then have a class that implements that interface.  But, what if performing that service relies on context that the base class doesn't know about (and shouldn't know about)?  What happens is that the base class provides virtual methods, which are either protected or private, and these virtual methods are the hooks for subclasses to provide the piece of information or action that the base class does not know and cannot know.  Meanwhile, the base class can contain code that is common for all the child classes.  These subclasses would be sealed because they are meant to accomplish that one and only one concrete implementation of the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you make the argument that these subclasses should be further subclassed to enhance them?  I would say no because if that subclass couldn't get the job done in the first place then it should never have derived from the base class.  If you don't like it then you have the original interface, go write your own implementation class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sealing these subclasses also discourages deep levels of inheritence, which works well for GUI frameworks but works poorly for business logic layers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this you can have the controllers of the same name under any part of the namespace, so long as you qualify which routes belong to which namespaces (you can have multiple namespaces per routes if you need be!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But from here, you can put in a directory under your controller, so if your controller was "MyWebShop.Controllers", you'd put a directory of "Shop1" and the namespace would be "MyWebShop.Controllers.Shop1"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then this works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes)

        var shop2namespace = new RouteValueDictionary();
        shop2namespace.Add("namespaces", new HashSet&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;(new string[] 
        {

        routes.Add("Shop2", new Route("Shop2/{controller}/{action}/{id}", new MvcRouteHandler())
        {
            Defaults = new RouteValueDictionary(new
            {
                action = "Index",
                id = (string)null
            }),
            DataTokens = shop2namespace
        });

        var defaultnamespace = new RouteValueDictionary();
        defaultnamespace.Add("namespaces", new HashSet&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;(new string[]

        });
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only other thing is that it will reference a view still in the base directory, so if you put the view into directories to match, you will have to put the view name in when you return it inside the controller.&lt;/p&gt;

So in this case, there was nothing wrong with your page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debugging this is simply a matter of walking through your HTML in Firebug and figuring out which children of a block is exceeding the block's width. Firebug provides plenty of information for this purpose, although sometimes I need to use a calculator. I think what you described about being able to see which elements constrain other elements would simply be too complex and overwhelming, especially for elements that are removed from normal flow (such as floats or positioned elements). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, a deeper understanding of how CSS layout helps a lot as well. It can get pretty complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, it is generally recommended to assign explicit widths to floated elements -- the W3C CSS2 spec states that floats need to have an explicit width, and does not provide instructions of what to do without it. I think most modern browsers use the "shrink to fit" method, and will constrain themselves to the width of the content. However, this is not guaranteed in older browsers, and in something like a 3-column layout, you'll be at the mercy of at the width of content inside the floats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you're striving for IE6 compatibility, there are a number of &lt;a href="http://www.positioniseverything.net/explorer/expandingboxbug.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;float related bugs&lt;/a&gt; that could also cause similar problems. &lt;/p&gt;

Most clients, especially web mail, will strip out everything outside of the &amp;lt;body&amp;gt; tag, as well as &amp;lt;style&amp;gt; tags.

&lt;p&gt;Finalizers are not deterministic destructors like in C++. As others have pointed out, there is no guarantee of when it will be called, and indeed if you have enough memory, if it will &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; be called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the bad thing about finalizers is that, as Brian said, it causes your object to survive a garbage collection. This can be bad. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may or may not know, the GC is split into generations - Gen 0, 1 and 2, plus the Large Object Heap. Split is a loose term - you get one block of memory, but there are pointers of where the Gen 0 objects start and end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thought process is that you'll likely use lots of objects that will be short lived. So those should be easy and fast for the GC to get to - Gen 0 objects. So when there is memory pressure, the first thing it does is a Gen 0 collection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if that doesn't resolve enough pressure, then it goes back and does a Gen 1 sweep (redoing Gen 0), and then if still not enough, it does a Gen 2 sweep (redoing Gen 1 and Gen 0). So cleaning up long lived objects can take a while and be rather expensive (since your threads may be suspended during the operation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that if you do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~MyClass() { }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your object, no matter what, will live to Generation 2. This is because the GC has no way of calling the finalizer during garbage collection. So objects that have to be finalized are moved to a special queue to be cleaned out by a different thread (the finalizer thread - which if you kill makes all kinds of bad things happen). This means your objects hang around longer, and potentially force more garbage collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, all of that is just to drive home the point that you want to use IDisposable to clean up resources whenever possible and seriously try to find ways around using the finalizer. It's in your application's best interests.&lt;/p&gt;

I can only think of doing exactly what the OP said - try using some Javascript with an interval to send a callback if JS is activated - unfortunately I don't think you can check server side whether JS is enabled which is why you use  tags rather than render different content from the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Framework Design Guidelines...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In general, classes are the preferred
  construct for exposing abstractions.
  The main drawback of interfaces is
  that they are much less flexible than
  classes when it comes to allowing for
  evolution of APIs. Once you ship an
  interface, the set of its members is
  fixed forever. Any additions to the
  interface would break existing types
  implementing the interface.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;A class offers much more flexibility.
  You can add members to classes that
  have already shipped. As long as the
  method is not abstract (i.e., as long
  as you provide a default
  implementation of the method), any
  existing derived classes continue to
  function unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

(You can see already that a monad is a strange kind of datatype, since in most programming languages you couldn't write a function that takes an arbitrary value and creates a type from it. Monads use a kind of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type%5Fpolymorphism"&gt;&lt;em&gt;parametric polymorphism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Haskell notation, the monad interface is written&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Monad m where
  return :: a -&amp;gt; m a
  (&amp;gt;&amp;gt;=) :: forall a b . m a -&amp;gt; (a -&amp;gt; m b) -&amp;gt; m b
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These operations are supposed to obey certain "laws", but that's not terrifically important: the "laws" just codify the way sensible implementations of the operations ought to behave (basically, that &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; ought to agree about how values get transformed into monad instances and that &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/code&gt; is associative).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monads are not just about state and IO: they abstract a common pattern of computation that includes working with state, IO, exceptions, and non-determinism. Probably the simplest monads to understand are lists and option types:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;instance Monad [ ] where
    []     &amp;gt;&amp;gt;= k = []
    (x:xs) &amp;gt;&amp;gt;= k = k x ++ (xs &amp;gt;&amp;gt;= k)
    return x     = [x]

instance Monad Maybe where
    Just x  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;= k = k x
    Nothing &amp;gt;&amp;gt;= k = Nothing
    return x      = Just x
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; are the list constructors, &lt;code&gt;++&lt;/code&gt; is the concatenation operator, and &lt;code&gt;Just&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; are the &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; constructors. Both of these monads encapsulate common and useful patterns of computation on their respective data types (note that neither has anything to do with side effects or IO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You really have to play around writing some non-trivial Haskell code to appreciate what monads are about and why they are useful.&lt;/p&gt;

Therefore each Windows CE device can have a radically different OS installed (headless even).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coredll is the standard "common" library that gets included in a Windows CE installation, however it can contain different components depending on the other modules in the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to target a relatively standard version of Windows CE either target the Standard SDK set of components, or go for a Windows Mobile platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an SDK then install and use that. If none is available then you can generate an SDK using Platform Builder and the OS project files.&lt;/p&gt;

This repeater must be bound during the Init page event before &lt;code&gt;ViewState&lt;/code&gt; is initialized or the dynamically created user controls will not retain their state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This creates an interesting Catch-22 because the object I bind the repeater to needs to be created on initial page load, and then persisted in memory until the user opts to leave or save.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I cannot use &lt;code&gt;ViewState&lt;/code&gt; to store this object, yet have it available during Init, I have been forced to store it in Session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also has issues, because I have to explicitly null the session value during non postbacks in order to emulate how &lt;code&gt;ViewState&lt;/code&gt; works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has to be a better way to state management in this scenario. Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; Some good suggestions about using &lt;code&gt;LoadViewState&lt;/code&gt;, but I'm still having issues with state not being restored when I do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of disabling shutdown altogether, maybe you can just increase the amount of time it waits before killing the process.

&lt;p&gt;You'd do an ssh command like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh -L 8022:myinsideserver:22 paul@myoutsideserver
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That connects you to the machine that's accessible from the outside (myoutsideserver) and creates a tunnel through that ssh connection to port 22 (the standard ssh port) on the server that's only accessible from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you'd do another ssh command like this (leaving the first one still connected):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh -p 8022 paul@localhost
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That connection to port 8022 on your localhost will then get tunneled through the first ssh connection taking you over myinsideserver.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be something you have to do on myoutsideserver to allow forwarding of the ssh port.  I'm double-checking that now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmmm.  The ssh manpage says this:  **Only the superuser can forward privileged ports.  **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strike&gt;That sort of implies to me that the first ssh connection has to be as root.  Maybe somebody else can clarify that.&lt;/strike&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like superuser privileges aren't required as long as the forwarded port &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(in this case, 8022)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; isn't a privileged port (like 22).

&lt;p&gt;Long version: I wrote a &lt;a href="http://con.appspot.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;web app aimed at other web developers&lt;/a&gt;. I want my app to support the major web browsers (plus Google Chrome) in both presentation and AJAX behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began on Firefox/Firebug, then added conditional comments for a consistent styling under IE 6 and 7.  Next, to my amazement, I discovered that jQuery does not behave identically in IE; so I &lt;a href="http://github.com/jhs/app-engine-console/commit/4fe7741ad1856208b565eeab4260a64933929c01" rel="nofollow"&gt;changed my Javascript to be portable on FF and IE&lt;/a&gt; using conditionals and less pure jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I started testing on Webkit and Google Chrome and discovered that, not only are the styles inconsistant with both FF and IE, but Javascript is not executing at all, probably due to a syntax or parse error.  I expected some CSS work, but now I have more Javascript debugging to do!  At this point, I want to step back and think before writing piles of special cases for all situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;b&gt;not looking for a silver bullet, just best practices&lt;/b&gt; to keep things as understandable and maintainable as possible.  I prefer if this works with no server-side intelligence; however if there is a advantage to, for example, check the user-agent and then return different files to different browsers, that is fine if the total comprehensibility and maintainability of the web app is lower.  Thank you all very much!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was going to say that, but you beat me to it!  Anyways, I just wanted to add that there is also the -R option:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh -R 8022:myinsideserver:22 paul@myoutsideserver
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference is what machine you are connecting to/from.  My boss showed me this trick not too long ago, and it is definitely really nice to know... we were behind a firewall and needed to give external access to a machine... he got around it by ssh -R to another machine that was accessible... then connections to that machine were forwarded into the machine behind the firewall, so you need to use -R or -L based on which machine you are on and which you are ssh-ing to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I'm pretty sure you are fine to use a regular user as long as the port you are forwarding (in this case the 8022 port) is not below the restricted range (which I think is 1024, but I could be mistaken), because those are the "reserved" ports.  It doesn't matter that you are forwarding it to a "restricted" port because that port is not being opened (the machine is just having traffic sent to it through the tunnel, it has no knowledge of the tunnel), the 8022 port IS being open and so is restricted as such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Just remember, the tunnel is only open so long as the initial ssh remains open, so if it times out or you exit it, the tunnel will be closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the following code is in the file getip.rb,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;require 'socket'

&lt;p&gt;You have a couple of options, depending on how permanent you want the proxying to be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some sort of TCP proxy.  On Linux, the basic idea is that &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; the incoming packet is processed, you want to &lt;i&gt;change its destination&lt;/i&gt;&amp;mdash;i.e. prerouting destination NAT:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -i eth0 -d $externalip --dport 2222 --sport 
1024:65535 -j DNAT --to $internalip:22&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using SSH to establish temporary port forwarding.  From here, you have two options again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transparent proxy, where the client thinks that your visible host (on port 2222) is just a normal SSH server and doesn't realize that it is passing through.  While you lose some fine-grained control, you get convenience (especially if you want to use SSH to forward VNC or X11 all the way to the inner host).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the internal machine: &lt;code&gt;ssh -g -R 2222:localhost:22 $externalip&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then from the outside world: &lt;code&gt;ssh -p 2222 $externalip&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that the "internal" and "external" machines do not have to be on the same LAN.  You can port forward all the way around the world this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forcing login to the external machine first.  This is true "forwarding," not "proxying"; but the basic idea is this: You force people to log in to the external machine (so you control on who can log in and when, and you get logs of the activity), and from there they can SSH through to the inside.  It sounds like a chore, but if you &lt;i&gt;set up simple shell scripts on the external machine with the names of your internal hosts, coupled with password-less SSH keypairs&lt;/i&gt; then it is very straightforward for a user to log in.  So:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the external machine, you make a simple script, &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin/internalhost&lt;/code&gt; which simply runs &lt;code&gt;ssh $internalip&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the outside world, users do: &lt;code&gt;ssh $externalip internalhost&lt;/code&gt; and once they log in to the first machine, they are immediately forwarded through to the internal one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another advantage to this approach is that people don't get key management problems, since running two SSH services on one IP address will make the SSH client angry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
FYI, if you want to SSH to a server and you do not want to worry about keys, do this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have an alias in my shell called "nossh", so I can just do &lt;code&gt;nossh somehost&lt;/code&gt; and it will ignore all key errors.  Just understand that you are ignoring security information when you do this, so there is a theoretical risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of this information is from a talk I gave at Barcamp Bangkok all about fancy SSH tricks.  You can see &lt;a href="http://www.proven-corporation.com/static/ssh/" rel="nofollow"&gt;my slides&lt;/a&gt;, but I recommend the &lt;a href="http://www.proven-corporation.com/static/ssh/ssh.txt" rel="nofollow"&gt;text version&lt;/a&gt; as the S5 slides are kind of buggy.  Check out the section called "Forward Anything: Simple Port Forwarding" for info.  There is also information on creating a SOCKS5 proxy with OpenSSH.  Yes, you can do that.  OpenSSH is awesome like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Finally, if you are doing a lot of traversing into the internal network, consider setting up a VPN.  It sounds scary, but OpenVPN is quite simple and runs on all OSes.  I would say it's overkill just for SSH; but once you start port-forwarding through your port-forwards to get VNC, HTTP, or other stuff happening; or if you have lots of internal hosts to worry about, it can be simpler and more maintainable.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using a large number of "items", try to avoid creating a control for each one of them, rather reuse the controls. For example if you have 10 000 items, each corresponding to a button, it is very easy to (programatically) create a 10 000 buttons and wire up their event handlers, such that when you enter in the event handler, you know exactly which element you must work on. However it is much more efficient if you create, lets say, 500 buttons (because you know that only 500 buttons will be visible on the screen at any one time) and introduce a "mapping layer" between the buttons and the items, which dynamically reassigns the buttons to different items every time the user does something which would result in changing the set of buttons which should be visible (like moving a scrollbar for example).&lt;/p&gt;

If that file contains any class/module definitions, then your other code will now be able to use them. If the file just contains code which is not in any modules, it will get run as if it were in the same place as your 'require' call (like PHP include)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt; is to do with modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes all the methods in the module, and adds them to your class. Like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Orig
end

Orig.new.first_method # no such method

module MyModule
  def first_method
  end
end

class Orig
   include MyModule
end
Orig.new.first_method # will now run first_method as it's been added.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's also &lt;code&gt;extend&lt;/code&gt; which works like include does, but instead of adding the methods as &lt;em&gt;instance&lt;/em&gt; methods, adds them as &lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt; methods, like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note above, how when I wanted to access first_method, I created a new object of &lt;code&gt;Orig&lt;/code&gt; class. That's what I mean by instance method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class SecondClass
  extend MyModule
end
SecondClass.first_method # will call first_method
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that in this example I'm not making any new objects, just calling the method directly on the class, as if it had been defined as &lt;code&gt;self.first_method&lt;/code&gt; all along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the sites are fairly temporary (i.e. you build it quickly, it gets used for a specific purpose and amount of time and then it is effectively closed) then banging out these sites in the most comfortable way for you is perfectly acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a long list of bugs, fixes and improvements that you now need (or would like) to backport to your old sites, or your "small sites" are getting bigger and more complidated and this is causing you significant grief then you need to take a step back and re-evaluate how you structure and support these sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would very much agree that ASP.NET is a very much more mature and effective programming environment.  However, like any tool, you need to know (or learn) the right way to use it as it's not going to automatically turn you into a "super programmer" overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A way to break the ice is to agree with your boss that the next "site" you create is developed in ASP.NET.  Explain to him that it will take quite a lot longer than how you currently deliver sites because you have to "get your head around" ASP.NET, but the benefits are x,y and (exercise left to the reader!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I'm still in the transition phase (and I started using ASP.NET from v1!) as I have a fairly robust Classic ASP framework I'm developed and comfortable with.   However, I have used ASP.NET strategically and have found it VERY powerful and your do end up writing must less code, as so much is built into the .net framework, as long as you can find it in documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also recommend that you DONT use VB.NET and your bite the bullet to use C#.  The change of language is quite minor, but you reduce the chances of writing your sites exactly the same was as you used to. It helps break the bad habits annd gives you a chance to learn new techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't use alerts as often as job notifications, so the only tricky thing I can recall about them is that if you're raising an error and you want the alert to email you when that happens, you have to make sure that the raised error gets written to the log.

In this master page I have a multiview control with one view that has all the content for the content pages and one view that has some local content to the master page where I show error messages from all content pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this error view I have a asp.net Label control that displays the error messages. Usually the label works fine, but in some few cases the label is null, which renders a NullReferenceException. Now I have handled this case by checking if the label is null before using it, but still my question is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why is this label null? What are the circumstances that can generate this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; In the master page I have a method called SetErrorText that takes a string and sets the label. I'm calling this method from the content pages' Page_Load method, and this generally works fine. In all but two cases (that I've discovered so far) the label is initialised, and nothing separates these two cases from all the ones that work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, all other controls in the master page are initialised, such as the View-control that houses the label.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Page_Load of a content page rolls around, the master page should be populated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That will resolve your linking problems.  However that is just the start of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your larger problems will be things like exceptions, and memory allocation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must ensure that no exception cross from VC++ to gcc code, there are no guarantees of compatibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every object from the VC++ library will need to live on the heap because:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not mix gcc new/delete with anything from VC++, bad things will happen.  This goes for object construction on the stack too.  However, if you make an interface like create_some_obj()/delete_some_obj() you do not end up using gcc new to construct VC++ objects.  Maybe make a small handler object that handles construction and destruction.  This way you preserve RAII, but still use the c-interface for the true interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calling convention must be correct.  In VC++ there is cdecl and stdcall.  If gcc tried to call an imported function with the wrong calling type, bad things will happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is keep a simple interface that is ANSI C compliant, and you should be fine.  The fact that crazy C++ goes on behind is okay, as long as it is contained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and make sure all the code is re-entrant, or you risk opening a whole nother can-o-worms.&lt;/p&gt;

The fact that you never connect your repository to anyone else's to push and pull changes doesn't mean that tool won't be right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;TortoiseSVN&lt;/a&gt; is a free client, and integrates into your explorer- i.e. in right mouse click menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The repository can be just a directory somewhere on your PC or on a network drive. Backing up just means zipping up this directory &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few plugins to Visual studio for Subversion, &lt;a href="http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/" rel="nofollow"&gt;AnkSvn&lt;/a&gt; is one I have used, it is free and integrates nicely (i.e it will be smart about moving and deleting files etc)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subversion is a good choice for one developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this post, I've been using Mercurial. It is a Distributed SVN. The 'distributed' aspect may not be directly useful to a sole developer, however it is better at merging and is somewhat faster. There is also a free and good Windows Explorer extension client -  &lt;a href="http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tortoise Hg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in summary, if you are the sort of person who will work on many branches at once (doing spikes etc) or if you work on multiple PCs at once and would like full offline access to checkin history on both, then &lt;em&gt;Mercurial&lt;/em&gt;. If you just want simple tracking and a well proven and easy to understand solution, then &lt;em&gt;Subversion&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would &lt;strong&gt;strongly&lt;/strong&gt; recommended separate machine to source control server. At best somewhere &lt;em&gt;on the cloud&lt;/em&gt;. Advantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don't lost your source control repositories if your development box dies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don't have to worry about maintenance of one more box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are companies which &lt;a href="http://www.svnhostingcomparison.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;host SVN repositories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Disadvantages of SVN&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am using SVN on Windows machine for about 5 years and found that SVN has a few disadvantages :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;It is slow on large repositories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SVN (or its client -- TortoiseSVN) has one &lt;strong&gt;big&lt;/strong&gt; disadvantage -- it terrible slow (while updating or committing) on large (thousands of files) repositories unless you have &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive" rel="nofollow"&gt;SSD&lt;/a&gt; drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Merging can be difficult&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people complain about how hard merging is with SVN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do merging for about 4 years (including about 2 years in CVS -- that was terrible, but doable) and about 2 years with SVN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And personally I don't find it hard -- on the other hand -- any merge is easy after merging branches in CVS :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do merge of large repository (two repositories in fact) once a week and rarely I have conflicts which are hard to solve (most of conflicts are solved automatically with &lt;em&gt;diff&lt;/em&gt; software which I use).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However in case of project of a few developers merging should not be problem at all if you keep a few simple rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;merge changes often,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid active development in various branches simultaneously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Added in July 2011&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many devs recommended &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control_system" rel="nofollow"&gt;Distributed Version Control&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href="http://git-scm.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mercurial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;strong&gt;single developer&lt;/strong&gt; perspective there are only a few important advantages of DVCS over SVN:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DVCS can be faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can commit to local repository without access to central one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DVCS is hot thing and fancy to use/learn (if someone pay for your learning).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I don't think merging is a problem in case of single developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joel Spolsky wrote &lt;a href="http://hginit.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;tutorial about Mercurial&lt;/a&gt; which is definitively worth to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, despite of many advantages of DVCS I would stay with SVN if merging or speed is not a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or try Mercurial, which according to &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/995636/popularity-of-git-mercurial-bazaar-vs-which-to-recommend"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2550091/best-support-now-on-windows-mercurial-or-git"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; SO questions, is better supported (in July 2011) on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Added in July 2014&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For about a year I use Git (Git Bash mainly) for my pet-projects (i.e. solving Euler problems) and local branches for each Euler problem are really nice feature -- exactly as it is described as advantage of DVCS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Git tooling on Windows is much, much better then 2 or more years ago.
You can use remote repo (like GitHub or ProjectLocker and many others) to keep 
copy of your project away from your workstation with no extra effort/money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I use GUI client only to looks at diffs (and sometimes to choose files to commit),
so it's better to not afraid of command line -- it's really nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as of today I would go with Git.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"but my instincts tell me that this
  would cut a maximum of two type casts
  operations down to a maximum of one."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do the cast as you were suggesting in example 1 (using is &amp;amp; as), it results in 2 calls to the "is" operator. Because when you do "c = obj as MyClass", first it calls "is" behind the scenes, then if it fails that it simply returns null.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do the cast as you were suggesting in example 2,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;c = (MyClass)obj
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then this actually performs the "is" operation again, then if it fails that check,it throws an exception (InvalidCastException).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you wanted to do a lightweight dynamic cast, it's best to do the 3rd example you provided:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;MyClass c;
if (obj is MyClass)
{
    c = obj as MyClass
}

if (c != null)
{
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;vs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;MyClass c = obj as MyClass;

if (c != null)
{
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see which is quicker, more consise and clearer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you have a table of customers. Surely you don't want a customer to exist in the table more than once, or lots of confusion will happen throughout your sales and logistics departments (especially if the multiple rows about the customer contain different information).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you have a customer identifier which uniquely identifies the customer and you make sure that the identifier is known by the customer (in invoices), so that the customer and the customer service people have a common reference in case they need to communicate. To guarantee no duplicated customer records, you add a uniqueness-constraint to the table, either through a primary key on the customer identifier or via a NOT NULL + UNIQUE constraint on the customer identifier column.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, for some reason (which I can't think of), you are asked to add a GUID column to the customer table and make that the primary key. If the customer identifier column is now left without a uniqueness-guarantee, you are asking for future trouble throughout the organization because the GUIDs will always be unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some "architect" might tell you that "oh, but we handle the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; customer uniqueness constraint in our app tier!". Right. Fashion regarding that general purpose programming languages and (especially) middle tier frameworks changes all the time, and will generally never out-live your database. And there is a very good chance that you will at some point need to access the database without going through the present application. == Trouble. (But fortunately, you and the "architect" are long gone, so you will not be there to clean up the mess.) In other words: Do maintain obvious constraints in the database (and in other tiers, as well, if you have the time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words: There may be good reasons to add GUID columns to tables, but please don't fall for the temptation to make that lower your ambitions for consistency within the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; (==non-GUID) information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Harder to do manual debugging, but not that hard&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In MySQL, you can't modify the same table which you use in the SELECT part.&lt;br&gt;
This behaviour is documented at:
&lt;a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/update.html"&gt;http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/update.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need to stop using the nested subquery and execute the operation in two parts, or alternatively use a simple where clause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is from Baron Schwartz, &lt;a href="http://www.nabble.com/Re%3A-Error%3A-You-can%27t-specify-target-table-%27...%27-for-update-in-FROM-clause-p15301235.html"&gt;published at Nabble&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, you can do multi-table updates like
this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;UPDATE tbl AS a
  INNER JOIN tbl AS b ON ....
  SET a.col = b.col
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you absolutely need the subquery, there's a workaround, but it's
ugly for several reasons, including performance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;UPDATE tbl SET col = (
  SELECT ... FROM (SELECT.... FROM) AS x);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nested subquery in the FROM clause creates an implicit temporary
table, so it doesn't count as the same table you're updating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) In VS2005/8, the things I mentioned (Tools/Options, External Tools) are all stored in the CurrentSettings.vssettings file, in the folder "Visual Studio 200{5|8}\Settings". This file is just XML, and it can be edited programmatically by anything that knows how to parse XML. You can also just paste a new vssettings file over the top of the default one (at least, this works for me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) The larger question of configuring a virgin PC.

&lt;p&gt;First up, that other server - what happens if your machine dies? the house burns down? etc. Having it on another machine is a good idea from a redundancy point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second one is WHAT:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are very familiar with visual source(un)safe, think about SourceGearVault. It's VERY nice, very fast, and very much a vastly improved "clone" of VSS (ie works the same way from the users POV, not under the hood). Needs SQL server and windows tho (it's .NET + SQL server). Free for 1 user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of you are not, then I suggest you do one of two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, get VisualSVN. It's great, works with VS2008 really well.
Second, if you MUST run it locally, get VisualSVN server (free!). Make sure you have a good backup plan. Runs on XP/2003/2008/Vista etc.It's just Apache + SVN, under the hood, so it just saves you on the setup - took me 5 mins to install and have it running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OR, and I prefer this one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;go somewhere like Unfuddle, Dreamhost etc, and get hosting for SVN. It's private, it's fast, and most of all - it's OFFSITE. My dreamhsot account, with something crazy like 500GB of storage and 1-2TB of transfer/month costs about $6/month! There are others which do SVN hosting + bug tracking etc. Look around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But yeah - SVN is the schizzzznit.you could create a local repository, but I like having a remote, backed up server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TFS is total, utter overkill for 1 developer (or &amp;lt;5 IMO)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the answer Jagmal but I'm not sure about using the BEGIN and END blocks for the setup and teardown as you are not making clear what you are doing by the names. There's also the obvious problem of only having one setup run and one teardown run per test, i.e. per each .t file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've had a quick look at Test::Most and it looks really interesting, especially the explain function. Thanks Matt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmmm. Just thinking further about using the BEGIN and END blocks, I'm thinking if I decrease the granularity of the tests so that there is only one setup and one teardown needed then this would be a good solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The really important part of your question is the 'why?' part. Now, going back 20 years to the 8086 days, the above would have been a real performance killer, but on the latest Pentium it would be a match speed wise to the two you posted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is purely down to memory and has nothing to do with the CPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CPU speeds compared to memory speeds have risen astronomically. Accessing memory has become the major bottleneck in application performance. All the swap algorithms will be spending most of their time waiting for data to be fetched from memory. Modern OS's can have up to 5 levels of memory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cache Level 1 - runs at the same speed as the CPU, has negligible access time, but is small&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cache Level 2 - runs a bit slower than L1 but is larger and has a bigger overhead to access (usually, data needs to be moved to L1 first)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cache Level 3 - (not always present) Often external to the CPU, slower and bigger than L2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RAM - the main system memory, usually implements a pipeline so there's latency in read requests (CPU requests data, message sent to RAM, RAM gets data, RAM sends data to CPU)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard Disk - when there's not enough RAM, data is paged to HD which is really slow, not really under CPU control as such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorting algorithms will make memory access worse since they usually access the memory in a very unordered way, thus incurring the inefficient overhead of fetching data from L2, RAM or HD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, optimising the swap method is really pointless - if it's only called a few times then any inefficiency is hidden due to the small number of calls, if it's called a lot then any inefficiency is hidden due to the number of cache misses (where the CPU needs to get data from L2 (1's of cycles), L3 (10's of cycles), RAM (100's of cycles), HD (!)).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you really need to do is look at the algorithm that calls the swap method. This is not a trivial exercise. Although the Big-O notation is useful, an O(n) can be significantly faster than a O(log n) for small n. (I'm sure there's a CodingHorror article about this.) Also, many algorithms have degenerate cases where the code does more than is necessary (using qsort on nearly ordered data could be slower than a bubble sort with an early-out check). So, you need to analyse your algorithm and the data it's using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which leads to how to analyse the code. Profilers are useful but you do need to know how to interpret the results. Never use a single run to gather results, always average results over many executions - because your test application could have been paged to hard disk by the OS halfway through. Always profile release, optimised builds, profiling debug code is pointless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to the original question - which is faster? - it's like trying to figure out if a Ferrari is faster than a Lambourgini by looking at the size and shape of the wing mirror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMO, Pros of using database to store images are,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. You don't need FS structure to hold your images&lt;br&gt;
B. Database indexes perform better than FS trees when more number of items are to be stored&lt;br&gt;
C. Smartly tuned database perform good job at caching the query results&lt;br&gt;
D. Backups are simple. It also works well if you have replication set up and content is delivered from a server near to user. In such cases, explicit synchronization is not required.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your images are going to be small (say &amp;lt; 64k) and the storage engine of your db supports inline (in record) BLOBs, it improves performance further as no indirection is required (Locality of reference is achieved). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storing images may be a bad idea when you are dealing with small number of huge sized images. Another problem with storing images in db is that, metadata like creation, modification dates must handled by your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selectors are unable to ascend&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CSS offers no way to select a parent or ancestor of element that satisfies certain criteria. A more advanced selector scheme (such as XPath) would enable more sophisticated stylesheets. However, the major reasons for the CSS Working Group rejecting proposals for parent selectors are related to browser performance and incremental rendering issues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for anyone searching SO in future, this might also be referred to as an ancestor selector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-selectors4-20110929/#subject"&gt;Selectors Level 4 Spec&lt;/a&gt; allows you to select which part of the select is the subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The subject of the selector can be explicitly identified by prepending
  a dollar sign ($) to one of the compound selectors in a selector.
  Although the element structure that the selector represents is the
  same with or without the dollar sign, indicating the subject in this
  way can change which compound selector represents the subject in that
  structure.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 1:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;For example, the following selector represents a list item LI unique child of
  an ordered list OL:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;OL &amp;gt; LI:only-child
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;However the following one represents an ordered list OL having a unique child,
  that child being a LI:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$OL &amp;gt; LI:only-child
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The structures represented by these two selectors are the same,
  but the subjects of the selectors are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this isn't available (currently, November 2011) in any browser or as a selector in jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Garbage collecter will never directly execute a Dispose method for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The GC &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; execute finalizers when it feels like it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One common pattern that is used for objects that have a finalizer is to have it call a method which is by convention defined as Dispose(bool disposing) passing false to indicate that the call was made due to finalization rather than an explicit Dispose call.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is because it is not safe to make any assumptions about other managed objects while finalizing an object (they may have already been finalized).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
class SomeObject : IDisposable {
 IntPtr _SomeNativeHandle;
 FileStream _SomeFileStream;

 // Something useful here

 ~ SomeObject() {
  Dispose(false);
 }

 public void Dispose() {
  Dispose(true);
 }

 protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing) {
  if(disposing) {
   GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
   //Because the object was explicitly disposed, there will be no need to 
   //run the finalizer.  Suppressing it reduces pressure on the GC

   //The managed reference to an IDisposable is disposed only if the 
   _SomeFileStream.Dispose();
  }

  //Regardless, clean up the native handle ourselves.  Because it is simple a member
  // of the current instance, the GC can't have done anything to it, 
  // and this is the onlyplace to safely clean up

  if(IntPtr.Zero != _SomeNativeHandle) {
   NativeMethods.CloseHandle(_SomeNativeHandle);
   _SomeNativeHandle = IntPtr.Zero;
  }
 }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's the simple version, but there are a lot of nuances that can trip you up on this pattern.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The contract for IDisposable.Dispose indicates that it must be safe to call multiple times (calling Dispose on an object that was already disposed should do nothing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can get very complicated to properly manage an inheritance hierarchy of disposable objects, especially if different layers introduce new Disposable and unmanaged resources.  In the pattern above Dispose(bool) is virtual to allow it to be overridden so that it can be managed, but I find it to be error-prone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, it is much better to completely avoid having any types that directly contain both disposable references and native resources that may require finalization.  SafeHandles provide a very clean way of doing this by encapsulating native resources into disposable that internally provide their own finalization (along with a number of other benefits like removing the window during P/Invoke where a native handle could be lost due to an asynchronous exception).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply defining a SafeHandle makes this Trivial:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
private class SomeSafeHandle
 : SafeHandleZeroOrMinusOneIsInvalid {
 public SomeSafeHandle()
  : base(true)
  { }

 protected override bool ReleaseHandle()
 { return NativeMethods.CloseHandle(handle); }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Allows you to simplify the containing type to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
class SomeObject : IDisposable {
 SomeSafeHandle _SomeSafeHandle;
 FileStream _SomeFileStream;
 // Something useful here
 public virtual void Dispose() {
  _SomeSafeHandle.Dispose();
  _SomeFileStream.Dispose();
 }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way you can do it is perhaps use BEGIN/END blocks, if the resources are to be used over the whole file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general approach I take is to put related tests in one code block and then initialize the variables/resource etc there. You can perhaps keep an easy count of how many tests you have for each function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something like ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;BEGIN {

{
     # have more fun .... 
}

   # Clean up the BEGIN changes

ListBox class whose HTML looks like this: sets the width of the SELECT
to that of your widest value's width (the max width of the scrollbar,
for example). Now wrap that SELECT inside of a DIV of the 'constrained'
size and let it scroll on overflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a quick example starting down those lines, here's the type of
HTML you want spit out by a control:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div style="width:200px; height:100px; overflow:auto;"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;SELECT size="4"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;OPTION
Value="1"&amp;gt;blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah blahblah&amp;lt;/OPTION&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;OPTION Value="2"&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/OPTION&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;OPTION Value="3"&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/OPTION&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;OPTION Value="4"&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/OPTION&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/SELECT&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so in essence I'd recommend creating a composite custom control for
this, which renders this HTML. They're pretty easy to make, Google on
the terms 'composite control asp.net'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The toughest part will be matching up the div dimensions to that of the
select box, to make the scrollbars work/line up properly. That's why
it's kinda tricky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;: Make sure you have enough height to include the scroll bar height or else you'll get the vertical scroll bar on both controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an argument that manipulation of the data belongs in the database layer, so that the business logic does not need to be overly concerned about how the manipulation happens, it just knows that it has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another very good reason to process data on the db layer is if the volume of data being crunched means that network bandwidth will become an issue. I once had to categorise very large amounts of data. Processing this in the application layer was severly restricted by the time required to transfer all the data across the network for processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then wrote a binning algorithm in PL/pgSQL and it worked much faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding untrusted languages, I heard a podcast from Josh Berkus (a postgres advocate) who discussed an application of postgresql that brought in data from MySQL as part of its processing, so that the communication itself was handled by the postgres server. I don't remember the full details, I think it was on the &lt;a href="http://www.twit.tv/floss18" rel="nofollow"&gt;FLOSS Weekly podcast&lt;/a&gt; which is quite an interesting discussion of the history of PostGRESQL and some of the issues it is put to.&lt;/p&gt;

The application is OSGi and much of the information the scripts may need is not know up front. I figured I could use GroovyShell and call eval() multiple times continually appending to the namespace as OSGi bundles are loaded. GroovyShell maintains variable state over multiple eval calls, but not class definitions or methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;goal: Create a base class during startup. As OSGi bundles load, create derived classes as needed. &lt;/p&gt;

The underlying justification may be compatibility with languange history, ideals, or simplification of compiler design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The compiler may (and does) choose to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a big if-else statement &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use a MSIL switch instruction (jump table)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build a Generic.Dictionary&amp;lt;string,int32&amp;gt;, populate it on first use, and call
Generic.Dictionary&amp;lt;&amp;gt;::TryGetValue()
for a index to pass to a MSIL switch
instruction (jump table) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use a
combination of if-elses &amp;amp; MSIL
"switch" jumps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The switch statement IS NOT a constant time branch. The compiler may find short-cuts (using hash buckets, etc), but more complicated cases will generate more complicated MSIL code with some cases branching out earlier than others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To handle the String case, the compiler will end up (at some point) using a.Equals(b) (and possibly a.GetHashCode() ). I think it would be trival for the compiler to use any object that satisfies these constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the need for static case expressions... some of those optimisations (hashing, caching, etc) would not be available if the case expressions weren't deterministic. But we've already seen that sometimes the compiler just picks the simplistic if-else-if-else road anyway...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/44905/c-switch-statement-limitations-why#44918" rel="nofollow"&gt;lomaxx&lt;/a&gt; - Your understanding of the "typeof" operator is not correct. The "typeof" operator is used to obtain the System.Type object for a type (nothing to do with its supertypes or interfaces). Checking run-time compatibility of an object with a given type is the "is" operator's job. The use of "typeof" here to express an object is irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using plain JSP views (as is most common), then simply add&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;% response.setStatus( 403 ); %&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;somewhere in your view file. At the top is a nice place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detail&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In MVC, i would always set this in the view, and in most cases with Spring-MVC, use the &lt;code&gt;SimpleMappingExceptionResolver&lt;/code&gt; to present the correct view in response to a thrown runtime Exception. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example: create and throw a &lt;code&gt;PermissionDeniedException&lt;/code&gt; in your controller or service layer and have the exception resolver point to a view file &lt;code&gt;permissionDenied.jsp&lt;/code&gt;. This view file sets the 403 status and shows the user an appropriate message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your Spring bean XML file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;bean id="exceptionResolver"
      class="org.springframework.web.servlet.handler.SimpleMappingExceptionResolver"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;property name="exceptionMappings"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;props&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;prop key="PermissionDeniedException"&amp;gt;          
        rescues/permissionDenied
      &amp;lt;/prop&amp;gt;
      ... set other exception/view mappings as &amp;lt;prop&amp;gt;s here ...
    &amp;lt;/props&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/property&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;property name="defaultErrorView" value="rescues/general" /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/bean&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;bean id="viewResolver"
      class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.InternalResourceViewResolver"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;property name="viewClass" value="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.JstlView" /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;property name="prefix" value="/WEB-INF/views/" /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;property name="suffix" value=".jsp" /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/bean&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

procedure MyFunction();
var
