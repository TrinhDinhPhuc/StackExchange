It may be an internal or external proxy depending on your network configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would avoid using the UserHostName for what is effectively authentication as it is presented by the browser duing the request and would be easy to spoof. IP address would be much more effective as it's difficult to spoof an IP address in a TCP/IP connection (and maintain a connection). It's still weak authentication but may be sufficient in this scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you are using IP address, if there's a NAT proxy between client and server, you may have to accept that anything coming through that proxy is trusted (I'm assuming that external/untrusted clients don't come through that proxy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that isn't acceptable, you're back to other methods of authentication. Rather than requiring a logon or VPN connection, you might consider a permanent cookie or client certificates and only give those to internal clients but you would need some way of delivering those to the client. You could certainly deliver a permanent cookie based on a one-time logon. Cookies can be spoofed in a similar way in that the UserHostName can be however you've got a better opportunity to create a cookie value that is less guessable than a domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BTW, I would like to say that I realise that this is not a supported environment and I share this for purely pedagogic rea&lt;/strong&gt;sons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download and install the iPhoneSDK (final version)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the install finishes, navigate to the packages directory in the mounted DMG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install all of the pkg's that start with iPhone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the contents of &lt;code&gt;/Platforms&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;/Developer/Platforms&lt;/code&gt; (should be two folders starting with iPhone)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Locate '&lt;code&gt;iPhone Simulator Architectures.xcspec&lt;/code&gt;' in &lt;code&gt;/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/Library/Xcode/Specifications&lt;/code&gt; and open in a text editor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change line 12 to: &lt;code&gt;Name = "Standard (iPhone Simulator: i386 ppc)";&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change line 16 to: &lt;code&gt;RealArchitectures = ( i386, ppc );&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the following to line 40 onwards:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    // PowerPC
    { Type = Architecture;
    Identifier = ppc;
    Name = "PowerPC";
    Description = "32-bit PowerPC";
    PerArchBuildSettingName = "PowerPC";
    ByteOrder = big;
    ListInEnum = NO;
    SortNumber = 106;
    },
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the file and start Xcode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should see under the New Project Folder the ability to create iPhone applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To get an app to work in the simulator (and using the WhichWayIsUp example) open Edit Project Settings under the Project menu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the Build tab change the Architectures to: Standard (iPhone Simulator:i386 ppc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change Base SDK to Simulator - iPhone OS 2.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build and go should now see the app build and run in the simulator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

One of them is a setup project. If you expand the setup project in the Solution Explorer, you see a Detected Dependencies node. If you right click on it, you get a menu item called Refresh Dependencies. This refreshes any dependencies based on the files included in the setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am asking if I can execute this action outside Visual Studio, using either devenv.com or MSBuild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want this because I am using CruiseControl.NET for continuous integration and in some solutions I found that the setup output is missing some dependencies because of the way I automatically build the projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that my setup is not very friendly to how Setup projects work in Visual Studio. I ended up using Post Build Events in order to create the whole application structure ready to just be copied to a computer and work out of the box. I am not using setup projects in Visual Studio anymore, unless I really have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By calling page if you meant the page that took you to the action input page, then your input page will have to store HTTP header "Referer" in the request scope for the Action.&lt;/p&gt;

I wanted a customized theme, so I used the themeroller to generate a css file. When I used it, everything seemed to be working fine, but later I found that I can't control any input element contained in the dialog (i.e, can't type into a text field, can't check checkboxes). Further investigation revealed that this happens if I set the dialog attribute "modal" to true. This doesn't happen when I use the flora theme. &lt;/p&gt;

                    alert("hi!");
                }, 
                "cancel": function() { 
                    $(this).dialog("close"); 
                } 
            },
            close: function(){
                $("#something").val("");
            }
        });
    }
}

$(document).ready(topMenu.init);

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, only the referenced css file and class names are different.
Anybody have a clue as to what could be wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@David: I tried it, and it doesn't seem to work (neither on FF or IE). I tried inline css:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;style="z-index:5000"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and I've also tried it referencing an external css file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;#SERVICE03_DLG{z-index:5000;}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But neither of these work. Am I missing something in what you suggested?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Solve by brostbeef!&lt;br&gt;
Since I was originally using flora, I had mistakenly assumed that I have to specify a class attribute. Turns out, this is only true when you actually use the flora theme (as in the samples). If you use the customized theme, specifying a class attribute causes that strange behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Firefox (version 2 only compatible at the moment)   plug in lets your capture almost all web events, and save them and replay them in the same browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with another Firefox  Firebug&lt;/a&gt;
you can create some very powerful tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to set up &lt;a href="http://selenium-rc.openqa.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Selenium Remote Control&lt;/a&gt;
you can then convert the Selenium IDE tests into &lt;a href="http://www.nunit.org/index.php" rel="nofollow"&gt; nUnit tests&lt;/a&gt;, which you can run automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET/Welcome+to+CruiseControl.NET" rel="nofollow" &gt;cruise control &lt;/a&gt; and run these web tests as part of a daily build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about using Selenium remote control is that it can run the same functional tests on multiple browsers and operating systems, something that you can't do with the IDE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the web tests will take ages to run, there is an version of Selenium called &lt;a href="http://selenium-grid.openqa.org/" rel="nofollow" &gt;Selenium Grid&lt;/a&gt; that lets you use any old hardware you have spare to run the tests in parallel as part of a computing grid. Not tried this myself, but it sounds interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the above is open source and free which helped me convince management to use if :-)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Why doesn't C# support this class level generic type inference?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because they're generally ambiguous. By contrast, type inference is trivial for function calls (if all types appear in arguments). But in the case of constructor calls (glorified functions, for the sake of discussion), the compiler has to resolve multiple levels at the same time. One level is the class level and the other is the constructor arguments level. I believe solving this is algorithmically non-trivial. Intuitively, I'd say it's even NP-complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate an extreme case where resolution is impossible, imagine the following class and tell me what the compiler should do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Foo&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; {
    public Foo&amp;lt;U&amp;gt;(U x) { }
}

&lt;p&gt;I know this is not a great way and there are a few catches.

&lt;p&gt;To deal with it I just check for that one IP.  If I get the IP of the gateway, I provide the internal access.  If I get anything else they get the external one which requires additional authentication in my case.  In yours, it would just mean a different interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can make one big table with all the fields from all the objects with as special field for the type. This is fast but wastes space. Although modern databases save space by not storing empty fields. And if your only looking for all users in the table with every type of person in it things can get slow. Not all or-mappers support this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can make different tables for all the different child classes with all of the tables containing the base-class fields. This is ok from a performance perspective. But not from a maintenance perspective. Every time your base-class changes all the tables change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also make a table per class like you suggested. This way you need joins to get all the data. So it's less performant. I think it's the cleanest solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you want to use depends of course on your situation. None of the solutions is perfect so you have to weigh the pro's and cons &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider a database &lt;em&gt;view&lt;/em&gt; as the equivalent of an interface definition.
And a table is the equivalent of a class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in your example, all 3 person classes will implement the IPerson interface.
So you have 3 tables - one for each of 'User', 'Person' and 'SpecialPerson'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then have a view 'PersonView' or whatever that selects the common properties (as defined by your 'interface') from all 3 tables into the single view.
Use a 'PersonType' column in this view to store the actual type of the person being stored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when you're running a query that can be operated on any type of person, just query the PersonView view. &lt;/p&gt;

On top of this we have a framework that allows us to run all the subtests (the full unit test) or call individual subtests or sets of subtests to allow for running of just the ones we're working on at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;require&lt;/code&gt; is to strictly load a file once from a load path.  The loadpath is a string and this is the key used to determine if the file has already been loaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt; is used to "mix-in" modules into other classes. &lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt; is called on a module and the module methods are included as instance methods on the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  module MixInMethods
    def mixed_in_method
      "I'm a part of #{self.class}"
    end
  end

  class SampleClass

  end

  mixin_class = SampleClass.new
  puts my_class.mixed_in_method # &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'm a part of SampleClass
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But many times the module you want to mix in is not in the same file as the target class.  So you do a &lt;code&gt;require 'module_file_name'&lt;/code&gt; and then inside the class you do an &lt;code&gt;include module&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The link that appears to be &lt;a href="http://www.nondot.org/sabre/os/articles"&gt;most promising is down, so you'll need to poke through the http://www.nondot.org/sabre/os/articles&lt;/a&gt;"&gt;Archive.org version&lt;/a&gt; to read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day the bootloader takes the machine code of the kernel, puts it in memory, and jumps to it.  You can put any machine code in the kernel that you want, but most C programs expect an OS so you'll need to tell your compiler that it won't have all that, or the bootloader has to create some of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kernel then does all the heavy lifting, and I suspect it's the example kernel you want.  But there's a long way to go between having a kernel that says, "Hello world" to having a kernel that loads a command interpretor, provides disk services, and loads and manages programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might want to consider subscribing to ACM to get access to their older literature - there are lots of articles in the late 80's and early 90's in early computing magazines about how to &lt;a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=87073.87079"&gt;create alternative OSs&lt;/a&gt;.  There are likely books that are out of print from this era as well.  You might be able to get the same information for free by looking up the indexes of those magazines (which are available on that site - click "index" near the magazine name) and then asking around for people with a copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I know that usenet is dead (for so sayeth the prophets of internet doom) but you'll find that many of the craggy old experts from that era still live there.  You should search google groups (they have dejanews's old repository) and I expect you'll find many people asking the same questions a decade or 1.5 ago that you're asking now.  You may even run across Linus Torvalds' many queries for help as he was developing linux originally.  If searches don't bring anything up, ask in the appropriate newsgroup (probably starts with comp.arch, but search for ones with OS in the name).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

Have the primary key of the subclass tables also be a foreign key linking back to the supertype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason for doing it this way is that it then becomes much more logically consistent and you do not end up with a lot of fields that are NULL and nonsensical for that particular record. This method also makes it much more easy to add extra fields to the subtypes as you iterate your design process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does add the downside of adding JOINs to your queries, which can impact performance, but I almost always go with an ideal design first, and then look to optimise later if it proves to be necessary. The few times I have gone the 'optimal' way first I have almost always regretted it later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my design would be something like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PERSON (personid, name, address, phone, ...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SPECIALPERSON (personid REFERENCES PERSON(personid), extra fields...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USER (personid REFERENCES PERSON(personid), username, encryptedpassword, extra fields...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could also create VIEWs later on that aggregates the supertype and the subtype, if that is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one flaw in this approach is if you find yourself heavily searching for the subtypes associated with a particulare supertype. There is no easy answer to this off the top of my head, you could track it programmatically if necessary, or else run soem global queries and cache the results. It will really depend on the application.&lt;/p&gt;

I've created a simple desktop application in C# 3.0 to learn some C#, wpf and .Net 3.5.
My application essentially reads data from a csv file and stores it in a SQL server CE database. I use sqlmetal to generate the ORM code for the database.
My first iteration of this app is ugly as hell and I'm in the process of refactoring it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to my question. How would you architect a dekstop databse app in C#?
What are the best practices?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you create a Database Abstraction Layer (DAL) which uses the sqlmetal generated code? Or is the generated code enough of an abstraction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use DAL pattern, do you make it a singleton or a static member?
Do you use the View-Model-ModelView pattern with the DAL pattern?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apologies if this seems like a long open ended question, but I have been giving this a lot of thought recently.
I see a lot of examples on how to architect an enterprise n-tier app in C# but not that many on architecting standalone desktop apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's pretend that C# has an explicit constructor function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;//your example
var x = new Foo( 1 );

//becomes
var x = Foo.ctor( 1 );

//your problem is valid because this would be
var x = Foo&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;.ctor&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;( 1 );
//and T can't be inferred
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You're quite right that the first constructor can't be inferred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's go back to the class&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Foo&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; 
{
    //&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; can't mean anything else in this context
    public Foo(T x) { }
}

//this would now throw an exception unless the
//typeparam matches the parameter
var x = Foo&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;.ctor( 1 );

//so why wouldn't this work?
var x = Foo.ctor( 1 );
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, if I add your constructor back in (with its alternate type) we have an ambiguous call - exactly as if a normal method overload couldn't be resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Native Image Generator (Ngen.exe)
  is a tool that improves the
  performance of managed applications.
  Ngen.exe creates native images, which
  are files containing compiled
  processor-specific machine code, and
  installs them into the native image
  cache on the local computer. The
  runtime can use native images from the
  cache instead using the just-in-time
  (JIT) compiler to compile the original
  assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you still need the libraries from the framework in order to run your program. There's no feature that I know of with the MS .Net framework SDK that allows you to compile all the required files into a single executable&lt;/p&gt;

I've been toying with a generic programming language for last few years and although I've never come around to actually develop it (and probably never will), I've thought a lot about generic type inference and one of my top priorities has always been to allow the construction of classes without having to specify the generic type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C# simply lacks the set of rules to make this possible. I think the developers never saw the neccesity to include this. Actually, the following code would be very near to your proposition and solve the problem. All C# needs is an added syntax support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Foo&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; {
    public Foo(T x) {  }

// Notice: non-generic class overload. Possible in C#!
class Foo {

}

var x = Foo.ctor(42);

var arrayNodes = Array.slice.call(listNodes, 0);
arrayNodes.reverse();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to change the position, you will have to remove the DOM nodes and add them all again at the right position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Array.prototype.slice.call(arrayLike, 0)&lt;/code&gt; is a great way to convert an array-like to an array, but if you are using a JavaScript library, it may actually provide a even better/faster way to do it. For example, jQuery has &lt;code&gt;$.makeArray(arrayLike)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use the Array methods directly on the NodeList:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Array.prototype.reverse.call(listNodes);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can define a continuous sequence for characters and decimals, then you it will simply be a matter of some recursion / looping to generate part of that sequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few things to think about:
You may want to make this fat client app a web app (for example) at some point.  If so, you should be sure to keep separation between the business layer (and below) and the presentation.  The simplest way to do this is to be sure all calls to the business logic go through an interface of some kind.  A more complex way is to implement a full MVC setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing you may consider is making the data access layer independent of the business logic and user interface.  By this I mean that all calls from business logic into the DAL should be generic "get me this data" rather than "get me this data from SQL" or even worse "run this SQL statement".  In this way, you can replace your DAL with one that accesses a different database, XML files, or even something icky like flat files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, separation of concerns.  This allows you to grow in the future by adding a different UI, segmenting all three areas into their own tier, or changing the relevant technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since most C, C++, and Java programmers are not accustomed to having such freedoms, they do not demand them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another, more valid, reason is that the &lt;strong&gt;language complexity would increase&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, should the objects be compared with &lt;code&gt;.Equals()&lt;/code&gt; or with the &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; operator? Both are valid in some cases. Should we introduce new syntax to do this? Should we allow the programmer to introduce their own comparison method?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, allowing to switch on objects would &lt;strong&gt;break underlying assumptions about the switch statement&lt;/strong&gt;. There are two rules governing the switch statement that the compiler would not be able to enforce if objects were allowed to be switched on (see the &lt;a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/3/8/8/388e7205-bc10-4226-b2a8-75351c669b09/CSharp%20Language%20Specification.doc"&gt;C# version 3.0 language specification&lt;/a&gt;, 8.7.2):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That the values of switch labels are &lt;em&gt;constant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That the values of switch labels are &lt;em&gt;distinct&lt;/em&gt; (so that only one switch block can be selected for a given switch-expression)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider this code example in the hypothetical case that non-constant case values were allowed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void DoIt()
{
    String foo = "bar";
    Switch(foo, foo);
}

void Switch(String val1, String val2)
{
    switch ("bar")
    {
        // The compiler will not know that val1 and val2 are not distinct
        case val1:
            // Is this case block selected?
            break;
        case val2:
            // Or this one?
            break;
        case "bar":
            // Or perhaps this one?
            break;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will the code do? What if the case statements are reordered? Indeed, one of the reasons why C# made switch fall-through illegal is that the switch statements could be arbitrarily rearranged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These rules are in place for a reason - so that the programmer can, by looking at one case block, know for certain the precise condition under which the block is entered. When the aforementioned switch statement grows into 100 lines or more (and it will), such knowledge is invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently had a unique case of db polymorphism in a project. We had between 60 to 120 possible classes, each with its own set of 30 to 40 unique attributes, and about 10 - 12 common attributes on all the classes . We decided to go the SQL-XML route and ended up with a single table. Something like :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;PERSON (personid,persontype, name,address, phone, XMLOtherProperties)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;containing all common properties as columns and then a big XML property bag. The ORM layer was then responsible for reading/writing the respective properties from the XMLOtherProperties. A bit like :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; public string StrangeProperty
{
get { return XMLPropertyBag["StrangeProperty"];}
set { XMLPropertyBag["StrangeProperty"]= value;}
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(we ended up mapping the xml column as a Hastable rather than a XML doc, but you can use whatever suits your DAL best)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not going to win any design awards, but it will work if you have a large (or unknown) number of possible classes. And in SQL2005 you can still use XPATH in your SQL queries to select rows based on some property that is stored as XML.. it's just a small performance penalty to take in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;SSL connections require more resources on both ends of the connection, so you may be hitting some built-in server limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;TCP/IP uses a 16-bit port number to identify connections, only some of which (around 16,000) are used for dynamic client connections.  This would limit the number of active connections a single client could make to the same server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Linux, each process has a maximum number of file descriptors that it can have open, and each network connection uses one file descriptor.  I imagine Windows has a similar limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Perl provides a fork() keyword that
  corresponds to the Unix system call of
  the same name. On most Unix-like
  platforms where the fork() system call
  is available, Perl's fork() simply
  calls it.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;On some platforms such as Windows
  where the fork() system call is not
  available, Perl can be built to
  emulate fork() at the interpreter
  level. While the emulation is designed
  to be as compatible as possible with
  the real fork() at the the level of
  the Perl program, there are certain
  important differences that stem from
  the fact that all the pseudo child
  ``processes'' created this way live in
  the same real process as far as the
  operating system is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Video podcast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;???&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audio only mp3 player&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm looking for somewhere which will extract audio from video, but instead of a single file, for an on going video podcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would most like a website which would suck in the RSS and spit out an RSS (I'm thinking of something like Feedburner), though would settle for something on my own machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it must be on my machine, it should be quick, transparent, and automatic when I download each episode. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would you use?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Edit:&lt;/b&gt; I'm on an Ubuntu 8.04 machine; so running ffmpeg is no problem; however, I'm looking for automation and feed awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's my use case: I want to listen to &lt;a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=google+techtalks&amp;amp;so=1&amp;amp;output=rss" rel="nofollow"&gt;lectures&lt;/a&gt; at Google Video, or &lt;a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&lt;/a&gt;. These videos come out fairly often, so anything that's needed to be done manually will also be done fairly often. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's one approach I'd thought of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;download the RSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;parse the RSS for enclosures, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;download the enclosures, keeping a track what has already been downloaded previously&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;transcode the files, but not the ones done already&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reconstruct an RSS with the audio files, remembering to change the metadata.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;schedule to be run periodically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;point podcatcher at new RSS feed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also liked the approach of gPodder of using a &lt;a href="http://wiki.gpodder.org/wiki/Time_stretching#Using_the_post-download_script_hook" rel="nofollow"&gt;post-download script&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function addLoadEvent(func) {

        oldonload();
      }
      func();
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then put a call to addLoadEvent on your page and reference a function the sets the focus to you desired textbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in the page...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.example.com/example.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.example.com/example.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link href="empty.css?log=example.html" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And have your server side log the request, then return an empty css file. The same approach would apply to JavaScript or and image file, though in all cases you'll want to look carefully at what caching might take place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option would be to eliminate the search engines based on their &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent" rel="nofollow"&gt;user agent&lt;/a&gt;. There's a big list of possible user agents at &lt;a href="http://user-agents.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://user-agents.org/&lt;/a&gt; to get you started.

&lt;p&gt;Offcourse you can reduce the "100" to have the task happen more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also there is and article titled 'Simulate a Windows Service using ASP.NET to run scheduled jobs' at &lt;a href="http://www.codeproject.com/aspnet/ASPNETService.asp" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.codeproject.com/aspnet/ASPNETService.asp&lt;/a&gt; that uses an expiring cache to simulate a timer.  It claims it can be run on any hosted site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using the last one, please read this comment from a post about this technique:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You need to really be careful on the
  length of the task running. Every new
  Task is a new Worker Thread and
  theres a limited number of those - as
  it borrows a thread from the managed
  thread pool.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Starting in v3.5 of the Framework the
  maximum number of threads was
  increased 10x from 25 to 250. But
  theres now a logarithmic startup to
  them, so as it doles out more threads
  it gets stingier with them. If you run
  out of available threads in the
  managed thread pool - your response
  times are going to go through the
  roof.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;What youre really writing here is a
  messaging/queuing system.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;If youre doing things like updating
  the cache, then by all means - kick
  off a new task. If youre doing
  something like downloading a secondary
  HTTP resource or some kind of
  intensive database work - write a
  Windows Service and use a Queue that
  allows you more control over how much
  you bite off each time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As default  the app config file of the
  default appdomain is in the process
  exes directory and named the same as
  the process exe + ".config".  Also,
  note that a web.config file is an
  app.config - ASP.NET sets that as the
  config file for your appdomain.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;To change the config file, set an
  AppDomainSetup.ConfigurationFile to
  the new location and pass that
  AppDomainSetup to your call to
  AppDomain.CreateDomain(). Then, run
  all of the code requiring that
  application config from within that
  new appdomain.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Note, though, that you wont be able
  to choose the CLR version by setting
  the ConfigurationFile  at that point,
  a CLR will already be running, and
  there can only be one per process.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Application configuration files are
  per appdomain. So, you can set a dll
  config by using the method above, but
  that means that it will be used for
  the entire appdomain, and it only gets
  one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not possible to find out whether an object implements some interface by looking at XAML.&lt;br /&gt;
With constraints given you can find xml element that has a child named .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use following code:
It will return all elements having child element which name ends with &lt;strong&gt;.TheCollection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    static IEnumerable&amp;lt;XElement&amp;gt; FindElement(XElement root)

                yield return element.Parent;

            foreach (var subElement in FindElement(element))

&lt;p&gt;To make sure that object represented by this element implements some interface you need to read metadata from your assemblies. I would recommend you to use Mono.Cecil framework to analyze types in your assemblies without using reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realistically, you need to test your application in each browser, no browser 100% follows the W3C standards so ultimately you can't rely on following that at all. You need to test everything you do in any browser you wish to support. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As has been mentioned, Google Chrome has the same rendering engine as Safari/iPhone/etc., WebKit which passes Acid3, so there should be minimal issues if you follow the standards. But don't rely on it. Google Chrome currently uses a slightly older version of WebKit than Safari. I'm sure they'll eventually be on the same version at some point, but unfortunately any new browser becomes just another browser to test in.&lt;/p&gt;

Right now were considering some way of splitting up the tables (especially the one that accounts for the biggest part of the data) and Im now wondering, what would be the best way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The options Im currently aware of are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using MySQL Partitioning that comes with version 5.1 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using some kind of third party library that encapsulates the partitioning of the data (like hibernate shards)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementing it ourselves inside our application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our application is built on J2EE and EJB 2.1 (hopefully were switching to EJB 3 some day).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would you suggest?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT (2011-02-11):&lt;br&gt;
Just an update: Currently the size of the database is 380 GB, the data size of our "big" table is 220 GB and the size of its index is 36 GB. So while the whole table does not fit in memory any more, the index does.&lt;br&gt;
The system is still performing fine (still on the same hardware) and we're still thinking about partitioning the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT (2014-06-04):
One more update: The size of the whole database is 1.5 TB, the size of our "big" table is 1.1 TB. We upgraded our server to a 4 processor machine (Intel Xeon E7450) with 128 GB RAM.
The system is still performing fine.
What we're planning to do next is putting our big table on a separate database server (we've already done the necessary changes in our software) while simultaneously upgrading to new hardware with 256 GB RAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This setup is supposed to last for two years. Then we will either have to finally start implementing a sharding solution or just buy servers with 1 TB of RAM which should keep us going for some time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any way to see this kind of detailed changeset history across branches?  Some kind of power toy, or third party tool, or anything?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: The TFS Power Toy tfpt history /followbranches tool does not "expand merges," it only "expands branches" and therefore doesn't solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1)  Includes.  They just don't work like you expect in ASP.Net.  Of course, ASP.Net provides much better ways of accomplishing the same thing, but it's still a bit of a loss and can make migrating an old site to .Net a pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) ASP.Net won't go above the root folder for the application.  Where I'm at we have a rather complex intranet that's still mostly classic ASP, with a smattering of .Net apps here and there as things are updated or new stuff added.  It would be nice to be able to keep one copy of common code up fairly high in the folder hierarchy but still have each individual app isolated to it's own VD.  But then, that's what source control is for, so it's not a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the biggest advantage moving from Classic ASP and ASP.Net so far is the IDE.  It's so nice to be able to right click on a function call and choose "Go to Definition" rather than having to dig around to find the file where the function is actually implemented.  Huge time-saver.  And intellisense support and type safety when calling functions is a boon as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those out there using the .net framework and asp.net 2.0 or above, its trivial.  If you are using older versions of the framework, you'd need to write some javascript similar to above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your OnLoad handler (generally page_load if you are using the stock page template supplied with visual studio) you can use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C#&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;protected void PageLoad(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Page.SetFocus(txtMyInputBox);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VB.NET&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Protected Sub PageLoad(sender as Object, e as EventArgs)

    Page.SetFocus(txtMyInputBox)

End Sub
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(* Note I removed the underscore character from the function name that is generally Page_Load since in a code block it refused to render properly!  I could not see in the markup documentation how to get underscores to render unescaped.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;

One tricky thing about using LINQ with WebORB is that WebORB uses Reflection to automatically retrieve all the relationships of the object(s) you return to Flex. This causes severe time penalties as LINQ uses lazy loading to load relationships. To prevent this from happening, I do something like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Override your DataContext's constructor and add the following code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;this.DeferredLoadingEnabled = false;
DataLoadOptions dlo = new DataLoadOptions();
dlo.LoadWith&amp;lt;Order&amp;gt;(q =&amp;gt; q.Payments);
dlo.LoadWith&amp;lt;Order&amp;gt;(q =&amp;gt; q.Customer);
this.LoadOptions = dlo;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tells the DataContext to disable deferred loading of relationships and specifically instructs it to load just the relationships you want, without lazy loading. That way, WebORB isn't causing any lazy loading to happen through Reflection and the number of relationships being transferred to Flex is kept at a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps you in some way. It's definitely one of those little "gotchas" when working with Flex/WebORB and LINQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can't just URL encode the URL as given to you, because that would encode the /s and ?s as well, which you don't want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the question is, what's the correct behaviour here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you would want it to be turned into...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://www.somewebsite.com/method?a=%25d
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(i.e. the % is encode to the encoded version of % in a URL, so when method gets the input, it sees a as being set to %d)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think there's any library function which will do that sort of thing for you, since there's no 'correct' way to do it. About he only correct thing you can do is return an error message saying the URL you were given is invalid (just as URLWithString is)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wanted to try to handle the input, I guess you would need to search the URL for any % symbols which are not immediately followed by two hex characters, and then replace the % with %25 in that case. That should be quite possible with a regular expression, though I suspect there may be some additional complexities if your URLs start containing encoded versions of characters outside the ASCII character set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my list:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to avoid saving new projects
automatically to reduce garbage in
file system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncheck &lt;strong&gt;Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Projects and Solutions-&gt;Save new projects when created&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to add common file to multiple
projects without copying it to
projects directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right click on a project, select &lt;strong&gt;Add-&gt;Existing Item-&gt;Add as link&lt;/strong&gt; (press on small arrow on Add button)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to add project to solution
without including it in the build
process&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right click on solution, select &lt;strong&gt;Add-&gt;New solution folder&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Right click on created folder, &lt;strong&gt;select Add-&gt;Add existing project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to edit project file from Visual
Studio?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right click on project and select &lt;strong&gt;Unload Project&lt;/strong&gt;, right click on unloaded project and select &lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;.
Or install &lt;a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/PowerCommands" rel="nofollow"&gt;Power Commands&lt;/a&gt; and select &lt;strong&gt;Edit Project File&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to group files in the project
tree (like auto-generated files for
WinForms controls)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open project file for editing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;   Change&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Compile Include="MainFile.cs" /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;Compile Include="SecondaryFile.cs" /&amp;gt;

To

&amp;lt;Compile Include="SecondaryFile.cs "&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;DependentUpon&amp;gt; MainFile.cs &amp;lt;/DependentUpon&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/Compile&amp;gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're going to split it, you've got a few options:&lt;br /&gt;
 - Split it using the database system (don't know much about that)&lt;br /&gt;
 - Split it by row.&lt;br /&gt;
 - split it by column.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Splitting it by row would only be possible if your data can be separated easily into chunks. e.g. Something like &lt;a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Basecamp&lt;/a&gt; has multiple accounts which are completely separate. You could keep 50% of the accounts in one table and 50% in a different table on a different machine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Splitting by Column is good for situations where the row size contains large text fields or BLOBS. If you've got a table with (for example) a user image and a huge block of text, you could farm the image into a completely different table. (on a different machine)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You break normalisation here, but I don't think it would cause too many problems. &lt;/p&gt;

How you might really approach this solution depends on your requirements.  Do you need a cross platform solution?  Are you using new/delete or malloc/free (or both)?

&lt;p&gt;If you are working on the windows side, the MS debug runtime libraries have some basic debug detection functionality, and as another has already pointed out, there are several wrappers that can be included in your source to help with leak detection.  Finding a package that can work with both new/delete and malloc/free obviously gives you more flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know enough about the unix side to provide help, although again, others have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But beyond just leak detection, there is the notion of detecting memory corruption via buffer overruns (or underruns).  This type of debug functionality is I think more difficult than plain leak detection.  This type of system is also further complicated if you are working with C++ objects because polymorhpic classes can be deleted in varying ways causing trickiness in determining the true base pointer that is being deleted.  I know of no good "free" system that does decent protection for overruns.  we have written a system (cross platform) and found it to be pretty challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

I've got a first implementation up and running and am now looking towards improving performance, particularly at doing I/O more efficiently since the input file gets scanned many times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a rule of thumb for using mmap() versus reading in blocks via C++'s fstream library? What I'd like to do is read large blocks from disk into a buffer, process complete records from the buffer, and then read more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mmap() code could potentially get very messy since mmap'd blocks need to lie on page sized boundaries (my understanding) and records could potentially like across page boundaries. With fstreams, I can just seek to the start of a record and begin reading again, since we're not limited to reading blocks that lie on page sized boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I decide between these two options without actually writing up a complete implementation first? Any rules of thumb (e.g., mmap() is 2x faster) or simple tests?&lt;/p&gt;

Both client and server are implemented in C++. The client establishes a session to the server, then makes repeated calls to it over a period of time before finally closing the session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Periodically, however, especially under heavy load conditions, we are seeing an RPC exception show up with code 1754: &lt;code&gt;RPC_S_NOTHING_TO_EXPORT&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that this happens in the middle of a session. The user is logged on for a while, making successful calls, then one of the calls inexplicably returns this error. As far as we can tell, the server receives no indication that anything went wrong - and it definitely doesn't see the call the client made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The error code appears to have permanent implications, as well. Having the client retry the connection doesn't work, either. However, if the user has multiple user sessions active simultaneously between the same client and server, the other connections are unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, I have two questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know what &lt;code&gt;RPC_S_NOTHING_TO_EXPORT&lt;/code&gt; means?  The MSDN documentation simply says: &lt;code&gt;"No interfaces have been exported."&lt;/code&gt; ... Huh? The session was working fine for numerous instances of the same call up until this point...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any ideas as to how to identify the real problem? &lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt;: Capturing network traffic is something we would rather avoid, if possible, as the problem is sporadic enough that we would likely go through multiple gigabytes of traffic before running into an occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merge tracking is managed by the client and stored in a property (&lt;a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/merge-tracking/design.html"&gt;svn:mergeinfo&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use merge tracking you just merge as usual but without the revision range:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;svn merge trunkURL
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The client will take care of reading the properties to see what revision(s) need to be merged in and then update the properties with the newly-merged revision(s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.red-bean.com/sussman/?p=92"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a pretty basic overview of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Pitfalls, etc.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally haven't run into any problems with merge tracking, but my usage of the feature has been pretty light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Upgrading&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two upgrades you'll need to do to get merge tracking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server: Your server &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be running 1.5 to get merge tracking support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Client: You can use a 1.x client against a 1.5 server, &lt;strong&gt;but you won't get merge tracking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just upgrade everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This assumes a Unix-like environment on your development workstations. Cygwin will work fine.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your question sounds like you don't actually have any direct network access from your development workstations to your server, and what you're really looking for is a way to get Subversion to tell you which files have changed. &lt;strong&gt;svn export&lt;/strong&gt; supports an argument to let you check out only the files that changed between particular revisions. From the svn help:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  -r [--revision] arg      : ARG (some commands also take ARG1:ARG2 range)
                             A revision argument can be one of:
                                NUMBER       revision number
                                '{' DATE '}' revision at start of the date

                                'COMMITTED'  last commit at or before BASE
                                'PREV'       revision just before COMMITTED
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll need to keep track of what the latest revision you copied to the server. Assuming it's SVN revision xxxx:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;svn export -r xxxx:HEAD http://svn/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then simply copy the contents of the &lt;em&gt;deploy&lt;/em&gt; directory to your server on top of the existing files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This won't handle deleted files, which may prove problematic in some environments.&lt;/p&gt;

We want to expose read/write capabilities for various resources using the REST API. How do we implement the "form" part of this? I get how to expose "read" of our data by creating RESTful URLs that essentially function as method calls and return the data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET /restapi/myobject?param=object-id-maybe
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...and an XML document representing some data structure is returned. Fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, normally, in a web application, an "edit" would involve two requests: one to load the current version of the resources and populate the form with that data, and one to post the modified data back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don't get how you would do the same thing with HTTP methods that REST is sort of mapped to. It's a PUT, right? Can someone explain this?&lt;/p&gt;

Update: That definitely helps. But, I am still a bit confused about the server side? Obviously, I am not simply dealing with files here.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;char data[0x1000];
std::ifstream in("file.bin");

while (in)
{
  in.read(data, 0x1000);
  // do something with data
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;versus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const int file_size=something;
const int page_size=0x1000;
int off=0;
void *data;

int fd = open("filename.bin", O_RDONLY);

while (off &amp;lt; file_size)
{
  data = mmap(NULL, page_size, PROT_READ, 0, fd, off);
  // do stuff with data
  munmap(data, page_size);
  off += page_size;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, I'm leaving out details (like how to determine when you reach the end of the file in the event that your file isn't a multiple of &lt;code&gt;page_size&lt;/code&gt;, for instance), but it really shouldn't be much more complicated than this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can, you might try to break up your data into multiple files that can be mmap()-ed in whole instead of in part (much simpler).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago I had a half-baked implementation of a sliding-window mmap()-ed stream class for boost_iostreams, but nobody cared and I got busy with other stuff.  Most unfortunately, I deleted an archive of old unfinished projects a few weeks ago, and that was one of the victims :-(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: I should also add the caveat that this benchmark would look quite different in Windows because Microsoft implemented a nifty file cache that does most of what you would do with mmap in the first place.  I.e., for frequently-accessed files, you could just do std::ifstream.read() and it would be as fast as mmap, because the file cache would have already done a memory-mapping for you, and it's transparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Look, people: across a lot of different platform combinations of OS and standard libraries and disks and memory hierarchies, I can't say for certain that the system call &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;, viewed as a black box, will always always always be substantially faster than &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt;.  That wasn't exactly my intent, even if my words could be construed that way.  &lt;strong&gt;Ultimately, my point was that memory-mapped i/o is generally faster than byte-based i/o; this is still true&lt;/strong&gt;.  If you find experimentally that there's no difference between the two, then the only explanation that seems reasonable to me is that your platform implements memory-mapping under the covers in a way that is advantageous to the performance of calls to &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt;.  The only way to be absolutely certain that you're using memory-mapped i/o in a portable way is to use &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;.  If you don't care about portability and you can rely on the particular characteristics of your target platforms, then using &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; may be suitable without sacrificing measurably any performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit to clean up answer list:&lt;/strong&gt;
@jbl:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the sliding window mmap sounds
  interesting. Can you say a little more
  about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure - I was writing a C++ library for Git (a libgit++, if you will), and I ran into a similar problem to this: I needed to be able to open large (very large) files and not have performance be a total dog (as it would be with &lt;code&gt;std::fstream&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Boost::Iostreams&lt;/code&gt; already has a mapped_file Source, but the problem was that it was &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;ping whole files, which limits you to 2^(wordsize).  On 32-bit machines, 4GB isn't big enough.  It's not unreasonable to expect to have &lt;code&gt;.pack&lt;/code&gt; files in Git that become much larger than that, so I needed to read the file in chunks without resorting to regular file i/o.  Under the covers of &lt;code&gt;Boost::Iostreams&lt;/code&gt;, I implemented a Source, which is more or less another view of the interaction between &lt;code&gt;std::streambuf&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;std::istream&lt;/code&gt;.  You could also try a similar approach by just inheriting &lt;code&gt;std::filebuf&lt;/code&gt; into a &lt;code&gt;mapped_filebuf&lt;/code&gt; and similarly, inheriting &lt;code&gt;std::fstream&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;a mapped_fstream&lt;/code&gt;.  It's the interaction between the two that's difficult to get right.  &lt;code&gt;Boost::Iostreams&lt;/code&gt; has some of the work done for you, and it also provides hooks for filters and chains, so I thought it would be more useful to implement it that way.&lt;/p&gt;

Yes, I know that xaml doesn't include any indication of base types or interfaces.  But I do know the interface of the root objects, and the interface that the collection holds, at compile time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The serialized graphs are stored in a sql database as XML, and we're using linq to retrieve them as XElements.  Currently, along with your solution, we are limited to deserializing the graphs, iterating through them, pulling out the objects we want from the collection, removing all references to them from, and then disposing, their parents.  Its all very kludgy.  I was hoping for a single stroke solution; something along the lines of an xpath, but inline with our linq to sql query that returns just the elements we're looking for...&lt;/p&gt;

Basically I have a DLL that has a form compiled into it. The form will be used to display information to the screen. Eventually it will be asynchronous and expose a lot of customization in the dll. For now I just want it to display properly. The problem that I am having is that I use the dll by loading it in a Powershell session. So when I try to display the form and get it to come to the top and have focus, It has no problem with displaying over all the other apps, but I can't for the life of me get it to display over the Powershell window. Here is the code that I am currently using to try and get it to display. I am sure that the majority of it won't be required once I figure it out, this just represents all the things that I found via google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CLass Blah

        [DllImport("user32.dll", EntryPoint = "SetForegroundWindow")]
        public static extern bool SetForegroundWindow(IntPtr hWnd);

        [DllImport("User32.dll", EntryPoint = "ShowWindowAsync")]
        private static extern bool ShowWindowAsync(IntPtr hWnd, int cmdShow);
        private const int WS_SHOWNORMAL = 1;

    public void ShowMessage(string msg)
    {
            MessageForm msgFrm = new MessageForm();
            msgFrm.lblMessage.Text = "FOO";
            msgFrm.ShowDialog();
            msgFrm.BringToFront();
            msgFrm.TopMost = true;
            msgFrm.Activate();

            SystemParametersInfo((uint)0x2001, 0, 0, 0x0002 | 0x0001);
            ShowWindowAsync(msgFrm.Handle, WS_SHOWNORMAL);
            SetForegroundWindow(msgFrm.Handle);
            SystemParametersInfo((uint)0x2001, 200000, 200000, 0x0002 | 0x0001);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I say I'm sure that most of that is either not needed or even flat out wrong, I just wanted to show the things that I had tried. Also, as I mentioned, I plan to have this be asynchronously displayed at some point which I suspect will wind up requiring a separate thread. Would splitting the form out into it's own thread make it easier to cause it to get focus over the Powershell session? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance for the help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Joel, thanks for the info. Here is what I tried based on your suggestion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;msgFrm.ShowDialog();
msgFrm.BringToFront();
msgFrm.Focus();
Application.DoEvents();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The form still comes up &lt;em&gt;under&lt;/em&gt; the Powershell session. I'll proceed with working out the threading. I've spawned threads before but never where the parent thread needed to talk to the child thread, so we'll see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thnks for all the ideas so far folks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, threading it took care of the problem. @Quarrelsome, I did try both of those. Neither (nor both together) worked. I am curious as to what is evil about using threading? I am not using Application.Run and I have yet to have a problem. I am using a mediator class that both the parent thread and the child thread have access to. In that object I am using a ReaderWriterLock to lock one property that represents the message that I want displayed on the form that the child thread creates. The parent locks the property then writes what should be displayed. The child thread locks the property and reads what it should change the label on the form to. The child has to do this on a polling interval (I default it to 500ms) which I'm not real happy about, but I could not find an event driven way to let the child thread know that the proerty had changed, so I'm stuck with polling.&lt;/p&gt;

That way, we can avoid duplicate data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, SQL Server Integration Services (I know you are using Oracle) has a component which does "fuzzy" matching on strings, allowing you to find a near match rather than a straight one-to-one match. It is called Fuzzy Lookup. Basically it gives you a score, telling you how close to a match the two inputs are... You can then set threshholds to tell it how close it has to be to consider it a match (i.e. within 80% or whatever).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case mentioned in the question, the member that is added/removed is the static initialiser. This appears as ()V in class files. The contents of the method can be disassembled using javap -c. You should be able to make out the System.getProperty("foo") call and assignment to MYSTRING. However an assignment with a string literal (or any compile-time constant as defined by the Java Language Specification) is supported directly by the class file, so removing the need for a static initialiser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common case for code targeting J2SE 1.4 (use -source 1.4 -target 1.4) or earlier is static fields to old Class instances which appear as class literals in source code (MyClass.class). The Class instance is looked up on demand with Class.forName, and the stored in a static field. It is this static field that disrupts the serialVersionUID. From J2SE 5.0, a variant of the ldc opcode gives direct support for class literals, removing the need for the synthetic field. Again, all this can be shown with javap -c.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the sound of combinatorial tests in MbUnit, I've tried the abstract base class interface test technique with NUnit, and although it does work, you'd need to have a seperate test fixture for every interface a class implements (since in C# there is no multiple inheritance - although inner classes can be used, which is pretty cool).
In reality this is fine, maybe even advantageous because it groups your tests for the implementing class by interface. But it would be good if the framework could be smarter. If I could use an attribute to mark a class as an 'official' test class for an interface, and the framework would search the assembly under test for all classes that implement the interface, and run those tests on it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That would be cool. &lt;/p&gt;

I think you need to clarify shell vs host(emulator).  To me it sounds like you need another interface to your existing shell that better supports copy and paste, not another shell that supports more/different features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debug/Release&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unicode support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And so on..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that determined you can then create configurations for each combination required by yourself or other library users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When compiling and linking it is very important that you keep that libraries and executable consistent with respect to configurations used i.e. don't mix release &amp;amp; debug when linking.
I know on the Windows/VS platform this can cause subtle memory issues if debug &amp;amp; release libs are mixed within an executable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Brian has mentioned to Visual Studio it's best to use the Configuration Manager to setup how you want each configuration you require to be built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example our projects require the following configurations to be available depending on the executable being built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debug+Unicode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debug+ASCII&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Release+Unicode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Release+ASCII&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The users of this particular project use the Configuration Manager to match their executable requirements with the project's available configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the use of macros, they are used extensively in implementing compile time decisions for requirements like if the debug or release version of a function is to be linked. If you're using VS you can view the pre-processor definitions attribute to see how the various macros are defined e.g. _DEBUG _RELEASE, this is how the configuration controls whats compiled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What platform are you using to compile/link your projects?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Expanding on your updated comment..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the &lt;strong&gt;Configuration Manager&lt;/strong&gt; option is not available to you then I recommend using the following properties from the project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linker&lt;/strong&gt;-&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Library Directories&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Linker&lt;/strong&gt;-&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Input&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the macro &lt;code&gt;$(ConfigurationName)&lt;/code&gt; to link with the appropriate library configuration e.g. Debug/Release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$(ProjectDir)\..\third-party-prj\$(ConfigurationName)\third-party.lib
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build Events&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Custom Build Step&lt;/strong&gt; configuration property&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Execute a copy of the required library file(s) from the dependent project prior (or after) to the build occurring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;xcopy $(ProjectDir)\..\third-party-prj\$(ConfigurationName)\third-party.dll $(IntDir)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The macro &lt;code&gt;$(ProjectDir)&lt;/code&gt; will be substituted for the current project's location and causes the operation to occur relative to the current project.
The macro &lt;code&gt;$(ConfigurationName)&lt;/code&gt; will be substituted for the currently selected configuration (default is &lt;code&gt;Debug&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Release&lt;/code&gt;) which allows the correct items to be copied depending on what configuration is being built currently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use a regular naming convention for your project configurations it will help, as you can use the &lt;code&gt;$(ConfigurationName)&lt;/code&gt; macro, otherwise you can simply use a fixed string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never implement functions as macros for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type safety. There is none. The following only generates a warning when compiling but fails at run time: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;float a=1.5f,b=4.2f;
swap (a,b);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A templated function will always  be of the correct type (and why aren't you treating warnings as errors?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: As there's no templates in C, you need to write a separate swap for each type or use some hacky memory access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a text substitution. The following fails at run time (this time, without compiler warnings):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int a=1,temp=3;
swap (a,temp);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not a function. So, it can't be used as an argument to something like qsort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compilers are clever. I mean really clever. Made by really clever people. They can do inlining of functions. Even at link time (which is even more clever). Don't forget that inlining increases code size. Big code means more chance of cache miss when fetching instructions, which means slower code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Side effects. Macros have side effects! Consider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int &amp;amp;f1 ();
int &amp;amp;f2 ();
void func ()
{
  swap (f1 (), f2 ());
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, f1 and f2 will be called twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: A C version with nasty side effects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int a[10], b[10], i=0, j=0;
swap (a[i++], b[j++]);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macros: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCLs0jv_Efk" rel="nofollow"&gt;Just say no!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: This is why I prefer to define macro names in UPPERCASE so that they stand out in the code as a warning to use with care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT2: To answer Leahn Novash's comment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose we have a non-inlined function, f, that is converted by the compiler into a sequence of bytes then we can define the number of bytes thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;bytes = C(p) + C(f)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where C() gives the number of bytes produced, C(f) is the bytes for the function and C(p) is the bytes for the 'housekeeping' code, the preamble and post-amble the compiler adds to the function (creating and destroying the function's stack frame and so on). Now, to call function f requires C(c) bytes. If the function is called n times then the total code size is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;size = C(p) + C(f) + n.C(c)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's inline the function. C(p), the function's 'housekeeping', becomes zero since the function can use the stack frame of the caller. C(c) is also zero since there is now no call opcode. But, f is replicated wherever there was a call. So, the total code size is now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;size = n.C(f)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if C(f) is less than C(c) then the overall executable size will be reduced. But, if C(f) is greater than C(c) then the code size is going to increase. If C(f) and C(c) are similar then you need to consider C(p) as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how many bytes do C(f) and C(c) produce. Well, the simplest C++ function would be a getter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void GetValue () { return m_value; }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which would probably generate the four byte instruction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mov eax,[ecx + offsetof (m_value)]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which is four bytes. A call instuction is five bytes. So, there is an overall size saving. If the function is more complex, say an indexer ("return m_value [index];") or a calculation ("return m_value_a + m_value_b;") then the code will be bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Id="46149" PostTypeId="1" CreationDate="2008-09-05T16:08:51.767" Score="0" ViewCount="246" Body="&lt;p&gt;In my automated NAnt build we have a step that generates a lot of code off of the database (using SubSonic) and the code is separated into folders that match the schema name in the database.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/generated-code
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/dbo
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SomeTable.cs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OtherTable.cs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/abc
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer.cs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Order.cs &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The schema names are there to isolate the generated classes that an app will need.  For example, there is an ABC app, that will pull in the generated code from this central folder.  I'm doing that on a pre-build event, like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;del /F /Q $(ProjectDir)Entities\generated*.cs&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;copy $(ProjectDir)....\generated-code\abc*.cs $(ProjectDir)Entities\generated*.cs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on every build, the Nant script runs the generator which puts all the code into a central holding place, then it kicks off the solution build... which includes pre-build events for each of the projects that need their generated classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here's the friction I'm seeing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1)  Each new app needs to setup this pre-build event.  It kind of sucks to have to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2)  In our build server we don't generate code, so I actually have an IF $(ConfigurationName) == "Debug" before each of those commands, so it doens't happen for release builds&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3)  Sometimes the commands fail, which fails our local build.  It will fail if:
- there is no generated code yet (just setting up a new  project, no database yet)
- there is no existing code in the directory (first build)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;usually these are minor fixes and we've just hacked our way to getting a new project or a new machine up and running with the build, but it's preventing me from my 1-click-build Nirvana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I'd like to hear suggestions on how to improve this where it's a bit more durable.  Maybe move the copying of the code into the application folders into the NAnt script?  This seems kind of backwards to me, but I'm willing to listen to arguments for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, fire away :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an application written in Visual Basic 6.0 (not by him).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of users reported that when it run on Windows 2000 and tried to scan folders on disk it raised box with message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Run-time error 1012 Error accessing application data directories&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We couldn't google anything about it and didn't find anything about runtime error 1012 in VB6 help files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My guess was that VB calls some old API function which returns folder to which app has no access (private, ciphered, belongs to other user and app is run by user without needed privileges).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we could not reproduce this (on Windows XP professional).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone meets with bug like this in the past?&lt;/p&gt;

For example, you can't write conditional comments that target Firefox, but are ignored by Internet Explorer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I achieve the same effect as your example above is to sniff the user agent string. I then deliver a suitable CSS file for that browser. This isn't perfect because sometimes people change their user-agent string for compatibility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other way to target different browsers is to utilise browser specific hacks. These are particularly nasty because they usually rely on bugs in the browser and bugs are liable to be fixed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Package naming&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class your.package.YourClass
{
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;becomes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;package your.package
{
    class YourClass
    {
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Imports are required&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must explicitly import any outside classes used -- referring to them by their fully qualified name is no longer enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Interface methods can't be labelled 'public'&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes total sense, but AS2 will let you do it so if you have any they'll need to be removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Explicit 'override' keyword&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any functions that override a parent class function must be declared with the &lt;em&gt;override&lt;/em&gt; keyword, much like C#.  Along the same lines, if you have interfaces that extend other interfaces and redeclare functions, those overrides must be removed (again, as with &lt;em&gt;public,&lt;/em&gt; this notation didn't make sense anyway but AS2 let you do it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;All the Flash builtin stuff changed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You alluded to this above, but it's now &lt;em&gt;flash.display.MovieClip&lt;/em&gt; instead of just &lt;em&gt;MovieClip,&lt;/em&gt; for example.  There are a lot of specifics in this category, and I didn't get far enough to find them all, but there's going to be a lot of annoyance here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't get to work on this conversion to the point of success, but I was able in a matter of hours to write a quick C# tool that handled every aspect of this except the &lt;em&gt;override&lt;/em&gt; keyword.  Automating the imports can be tricky -- in my case the packages we use all start with a few root-level packages so they're easy to detect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I'm not being too verbose here, but here's the guide to making this work that I wrote for my work's wiki:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to Tools-&gt;Macros-&gt;Macro Explorer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Macro Explorer tree that comes up, right-click MyMacros, and then New Module....&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call the new module SyncItem (if you want).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click the new module, then Edit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paste this into the code window. (I don't know or care if the Imports lines are necessary; they're just there by default.) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Imports System
Imports EnvDTE
Imports EnvDTE80
Imports EnvDTE90
Imports System.Diagnostics

Public Module SyncItem

    Sub SyncSolutionExplorer()
        DTE.ExecuteCommand("View.TrackActivityinSolutionExplorer")
        DTE.ExecuteCommand("View.TrackActivityinSolutionExplorer")
    End Sub

End Module
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The macro is most useful if you bind it to a keystroke. Here's how to do that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to Tools-&gt;Options, then select Environment-&gt;Keyboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the new macro in the list (start typing "syncitem" or similar in the search box).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I chose Alt-Shift-T (which this dialog box likes to call Shift-Alt-T) for, um, "Tree," I guess? If you're a fan of Edit.LineTranspose, whatever that is (I think it swaps the current line with the following one), then you might like to pick a different shortcut. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you test that simple string comparison is too slow? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the comparison looks like ('ABC' == 'abc' or 'ABC' != 'abc')?  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many string do you have to compare? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many comparison do you have to do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How your strings look like (the length, letter case)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I remember String in Java is an object and two identical strings point to the same object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, maybe it would be enough to compare objects (probably string comparison is already implemented in this way).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it doesn't help you can try to use Pascal implementation of string object when first element is length and if your strings have various length this should save some CPU time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 4294967296 possible values for an integer (2^32). If you have a string of more than 4 ASCII characters, or more than two unicode characters, then there are more possible string values than possible integer values. You can't have a unique integer value for every possible 5 character string. Long values have more possible values, but they would only provide a unique value for every possible string of 8 ASCII characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hash codes are useful as a two step process: first see if the hash code matches, then check the whole string. For most strings that don't match, you only need to do the first step, and it's really fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that case, in order to guarantee uniqueness you'd have to use some sort of big integer representation.

I'll second what other's have said here, use some sort of hash, then in the event of a hash match check the original strings to weed out any collisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, If your strings are around 10 characters, I doubt that comparing, say, a bunch of 32 bit hashes will be all that much faster than direct string comparisons.  I think you have to ask yourself if it's it really worth the additional complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

If you include punctuation, lower case, etc then you can easily pass 72 possible values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A non-colliding number that allows you to quickly compare strings would necessarily grow exponentially with the length of the string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; must decide on the longest string you are expecting to compare.  Assuming it's N characters in length, and assuming you ONLY need uppercase letters and the numerals 0-9 then you need to have an integer representation that can be as high as
36^N&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a string of length 25 (common name field) then you end up needing a binary number with  130 bits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you compose that into 32 bit numbers, you'll need 4.  Then you can compare each number (four integer compares should take no time, compared to walking the string).  I would recommend a big number library, but for this specialized case I'm pretty sure you can write your own and get better performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to handle 72 possible values per character (uppercase, lowercase, numerals, punctuation...) and you need 10 characters, then you'll need 62 bits - two 32 bit integers (or one 64 bit if you're on a system that supports 64 bit computing)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, however, you are not able to restrict the numbers in the string (ie, could be any of the 256 letters/numbers/characters/etc) and you can't define the size of the string, then comparing the strings directly is the only way to go, but there's a shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cast the pointer of the string to a 32 bit unsigned integer array, and compare the string 4 bytes at a time (or 64 bits/8bytes at a time on a 64 bit processor).  This means that a 100 character string only requires 25 compares maximum to find which is greater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may need to re-define the character set (and convert the strings) so that the characters with higher precedence are assigned values closer to 0, and lower precedence values closer to 255 (or vice versa, depending on how you are comparing them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the class's design is still flexible and you've got a complicated private method that you'd like to test separately, I suggest you pull it out into a separate class and test that class separately. This doesn't have to change the public interface of the original class, it can internally create an instance of the helper class and call the helper method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to test difficult error conditions coming from the helper method, you can go a step further. Extract an interface from the helper class, add a public getter and setter to the original class to inject the helper class (used through its interface), and then inject a mock version of the helper class into the original class to test how the original class responds to exceptions from the helper. This approach is also helpful if you want to test the original class without also testing the helper class.&lt;/p&gt;

        }
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

This would rule out you simply handing out a list of one time pad numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several ways people have done this in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a public key and private key.  Encode the numbers 0-999,999 using the private key, and hand out the results.  You'll need to throw in some random numbers to make the result come out to the longer version, and you'll have to convert the result from base 64 to base 10.  When you get a number entered, convert it back to base64, apply the private key, and see if the intereting numbers are under 1,000,000 (discard the random numbers).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a &lt;a href="http://www.concentric.net/~Ttwang/tech/inthash.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;reversible hash function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the first million numbers from a PRN seeded at a specific value.  The "checking" function can get the seed, and know that the next million values are good.  It can either generate them each time and check one by one when a code is received, or on program startup store them all in a table, sorted, and then use binary search (maximum of compares) since one million integers is not a whole lot of space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a bunch of other options, but these are common and easy to implement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, Ive often just write a class remembers the time at construction and spits out (log file) the elapsed time in its destructor. I used &lt;a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/172338" rel="nofollow"&gt;QueryPerformanceCounter&lt;/a&gt;.  Id stick this class at the top of the function Id want to time. You could get fancy with making it a macro, use the preprocessor to include this class only under a special build&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for example:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="lang-html prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;fieldset&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;legend&amp;gt;New Blog Post&amp;lt;/legend&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;label for="title"&amp;gt;Title:&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;input type="text" name="title" /&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;label for="body"&amp;gt;Body:&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;textarea name="body" rows="6" cols="40"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/fieldset&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can take that html and layout the form either side-by-side labels, or labels on top of the textboxes (which is easier).  Having the flexibility really helps.  It's also less HTML than the table equivalent of either.&lt;/p&gt;

The module I am starting with is responsible for importing data from a variety of systems into our database.  About 5-6 times a year, a new client asks us to write a new import for the system that they use. Presently, this requires us to release a new version of our software for each new import option we add to the application. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the goals of the rewrite is to make the application support plug-ins. Every new import can become a separate assembly which the host application will recognize and allow the end user to interact with.  This will hopefully simplify life to some degree as we can simply drop a new assembly into the directory and have it be recognized and used by the main (host) application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the items I am struggling with relates to the differences between the import options we currently support. In some cases we actually let the user point to a directory and read all of the files within the directory into our system. In other cases we allow them to point to a single file and import its contents. Additionally, some imports have a date range restriction that the user applies while others do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is, how can I design the application in a manner that allows for some flexibility among the imports we build and support while at the same time implementing a common interface that will allow the host application to easily recognize the plug-ins and the options that each one exposes to the user?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;encode may throw an exception if 'bad' data (e.g. non-numeric) is passed to it, while verify only returns true or false. The idea here is that encode normally gets it's data from 'trusted' internal sources (a database key for instance), so it should be pretty usual, in fact, exceptional that bad data is being passed in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it sounds like you could pass the encode function a database key (5 digits, for instance) and you could get a number out that would meet your requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second one on that site is about how it's been "hacked" - the first one is the how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To kinda answer it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "root servers" (for .com for eg) hold a record for stackoverflow.com. But they can't hold all the details, so they have an NS record (name server record) saying "if you want more info, go look over there". So your machine asks that target machine (ns1.stackoverflow.com) for www.stackoverflow.com, and gets back the A record (IP address), or MX (mail etc)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, your domain register will store it in a database or whatever they chose, and when you do an update, they SOMEHOW (I dont know, but I guess it's published by NIC, but they DO have to pay to be a registrar, and be checked out etc) push that change to the (cluster of) root name servers. They would then push the changes for your domain (eg where www goes, where your mail goes etc) to their local server, which actually serves the domain info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that makes SOME sense :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Does this tell me that the
  stackoverflow.com nameservers have
  been stored in the .com name servers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes and no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its like you going calling directory assistance for everything ending in .com. You ask for stackoverflow - they tell you "if you want SO, call this number, and they can tell you how to get Jeff (www), Joel (mail), etc.".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The root server is the first directory assistance. Your register's name server is the one on the end of the second call (assuming you called it :) ) &lt;/p&gt;

TDD requires you to have the complete picture of what you build and you write your tests up front and then implement the code to make the test pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for example what we do instead, is to write a lot of tests when we are done. This is not always the best approach because you sometimes end up with bogus tests that pass, but are not really useful but at least it's something you can expand on. Internally we continue on tests and basically write a test for each bug we find. This is how it becomes more solid.&lt;/p&gt;

A registrar is a company that sells domain names (ie. godaddy) to buyers. Anyone can be a registrar. You can become a registrar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A registry is an entity (chosen by ICANN) that maintains the master database of domain names. There are several registries out there. The Internet Society (ISOC) is the registry for all .org names, Verisign is the registry for all .com and .net domain names. There are others and each country has one for their domain. All the registrars access and update the registry databases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A registry is responsible for maintaining the top level domain (TLD) which is the ultimate DNS server. A request to resolve a domain name, if it can't be resolved by any other DNS server will filter up to the TLD. Think of it as a hierarchy like a tree where the TLD is the trunk. At that point it will be resolved into an IP address or an error will be returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something in your code is trying to set a value for the key 'kramerImage' on an UIView, which (apparently) doesn't support that key.  If you're using Interface Builder, it might be something in your nib.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find where 'kramerImage' is being used, and try to track it down from there.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm giving this away for three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might find it useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though it's a bit krufty, I don't let that embarass me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though it's tied to some win32 hooks, that should be easy to alleviate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are things of which you must be careful when using it:  don't do anything that needs to lean on &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; in the underlying code, beware of the warnings about cases it might miss at the top of leakcheck.cpp, realize that if you turn on (and fix any issues with) the code that does image dumps, you may generate a huge file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design is meant to allow you to turn the checker on and off without recompiling everything that includes its header.  Include leakcheck.h where you want to track checking and rebuild once.  Thereafter, compile leakcheck.cpp with or without LEAKCHECK #define'd and then relink to turn it on and off.  Including unleakcheck.h will turn it off locally in a file.  Two macros are provided:  CLEARALLOCINFO() will avoid reporting the same file and line inappropriately when you traverse allocating code that didn't include leakcheck.h.  ALLOCFENCE() just drops a line in the generated report without doing any allocation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, please realize that I haven't used this in a while and you may have to work with it a bit.  I'm dropping it in to illustrate the idea.  If there turns out to be sufficient interest, I'd be willing to work up an example, updating the code in the process, and replace the contents of the following URL with something nicer that includes a decently syntax-colored listing.&lt;/p&gt;

Yes we did have full text catalogues in the database, but since I had disabled full text search for the database, and disabled msftesql, I didn't suspect them. I got however an article from Microsoft support, showing me how I could test for catalogues not properly removed. So I discovered that there still existed an old catalogue, which I ,after and only after re-enabling full text search, were able to delete, since then my backup has worked&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;lt;/XML&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have modified the example so the 202 isn't right, don't worry about that. On to the problem. The Content-Length matches the number of bytes on the file, however unless I manually increase the Content-Length it does not send all of the file, a few bytes get truncated. The number of bytes truncated is not the same for files of different sizes. I used the -r option on the script and I can see what it is sending and it is sending all of the file, but Google Appengine self.request.body shows that not everything is received. I think the solution is to get the right number for Content-Length and apparently it isn't as simple as number of bytes on the file or the perl script is mangling it somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update:
Thanks to Erickson for the right answer. I used printf to append characters to the end of the file and it always truncated exactly the number of lines in the file. I suppose I could figure out what is being added by iterating through every character on the server side but not worth it. This wasn't even answered over on the google groups set up for app engine!&lt;/p&gt;

Firefox might complain, but &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#display-prop" rel="nofollow"&gt;it's right&lt;/a&gt;. Also, try adding a &lt;code&gt;border: solid red 1px;&lt;/code&gt; to the CSS of the &lt;code&gt;.my-centered-content&lt;/code&gt; DIV to see what's happening as you try these things out.&lt;/p&gt;

Currently our site has a sliding expiration of 30 minutes.  Normally this isn't a problem because we use asp.net and most of the time the users update one or two fields and then submit the form.  This obviously keeps the session active.  I have struggled with how to handle this with significantly more complex forms/user interaction where there are few if no round trips to the server.  Now users can view reports, type emails etc. on our site, and I am struggling with how to keep their session active while they're actually using browser but they are not actively posting information back.  I would dispense with the sliding expiration, but it's a requirement, so I am stuck with it.  Most of our users are outside of the organization, so I can't use any form of SSO.  Does anyone have an elegant solution (I'll even go for an ugly one if it works), or am I out of luck?&lt;/p&gt;

Basically, we run the code generator .exe as a post-build step for another project and along with generating the code, it automates the active instance of visual studio to make sure that the generated project is in the solution, that it has all of the generated code files, and that they are checked out/added to TFS as necessary.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It very rarely flakes out during the VS automation stage, and we have to run it "by hand" but that's usually only if you have several instances of VS open with &gt;1 instance of the solution open and it can't figure out which one it's supposed to automate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our solution and process are such that the generation should always be done and correct before our auto-build gets to it, so this approach might not work for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This functionality isn't part of the default PostgreSQL install, but you can add it in. It's called &lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/dblink.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;dblink&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've never used it, but it is maintained and distributed with the rest of PostgreSQL. If you're using the version of PostgreSQL that came with your Linux distro, you might need to install a package called postgresql-contrib.&lt;/p&gt;

You normally don't want to use public key encryption (RSA, DSA) for the bulk data encryption due to its' large computational time.  Public key encryption should be used in the handshaking and key agreement phases in a security protocol, but the bulk data encryption should be handled by a symmetric cipher such as AES and TDES.  The TLS and SSL protocols work this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The formula is very simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a number : &lt;code&gt;123456&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Concat number and checksum to obtain the code =&gt; 12345676&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To validate a code, verify that &lt;code&gt;mod(code, 97) == 1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test :&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Certain characters have special significance in HTML, and should be represented by HTML entities if they are to preserve their meanings.

This can't &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; that any particular complexity class is achieved, but it can provide reassurance that the mathematical analysis is appropriate.  To help with this reassurance, I use code coverage tools in conjunction with my experiments, to ensure that I'm exercising all the cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a very simple example say you wanted to do a sanity check on the speed of the .NET framework's list sort.  You could write something like the following, then analyze the results in Excel to make sure they did not exceed an n*log(n) curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example I measure the number of comparisons, but it's also prudent to examine the actual time required for each sample size.  However then you must be even more careful that you are just measuring the algorithm and not including artifacts from your test infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all you want is a verification number then just use a sequence number (assuming you have a single point of generation).  That way you know you are not getting duplicates.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you prefix the sequence with a CRC-16 of that sequence number AND some private key.  You can use anything for the private key, as long as you keep it private.  Make it something big, at least a &lt;a href="http://www.guidgenerator.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;GUID&lt;/a&gt;, but it could be the text to &lt;a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2600" rel="nofollow"&gt;War and Peace from project Gutenberg&lt;/a&gt;.  Just needs to be secret and constant.  Having a private key prevents people from being able to forge a key, but using a 16 bit CR makes it easier to break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To validate you just split the number into its two parts, and then take a CRC-16 of the sequence number and the private key. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to obscure the sequential portion more, then split the CRC in two parts.  Put 3 digits at the front and 2 at the back of the sequence (zero pad so the length of the CRC is consistent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method allows you to start with smaller keys too.  The first 10 keys will be 6 digits.&lt;/p&gt;

If you've already renamed a file in the tree, you can use the "&lt;code&gt;--after&lt;/code&gt;" option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I highly recommend using source control, like Subversion, CVS, or Git. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organization of filesystem folder structure is subjective, but I generally have a "src" folder for all my source FLAs and AS class files, and a "deploy" or "bin" folder for compiled files. The src folder would contain class package files, with class packages organized in reverse domain style (e.g. - com.codehinting.projectname.context ). Modify the publish path of your FLA to publish to the deploy folder by tracing back up using the "../" path segment, for as many levels as needed to trace back from the nesting in the src folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I typically place third-party libraries (that are pretty well "baked") in a separate location and then modify the global classpath in the Flash IDE to point to this location.&lt;/p&gt;

Each class library project outputs a single binary, e.g. Company.Common.Serialization.dll. Since we own the compiled, tested binaries as well as the source code, there's debate as to whether our consuming applications should use binary or project references.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some arguments in favor of project references:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project references would allow users to debug and view all solution code without the overhead of loading additional projects/solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project references would assist in keeping up with common component changes committed to the source control system as changes would be easily identifiable without the active solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some arguments in favor of binary references:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Binary references would simplify solutions and make for faster solution loading times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Binary references would allow developers to focus on new code rather than potentially being distracted by code which is already baked and proven stable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Binary references would force us to appropriately dogfood our stuff as we would be using the common library just as those outside of our organization would be required to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since a binary reference can't be debugged (stepped into), one would be forced to replicate and fix issues by extending the existing test projects rather than testing and fixing within the context of the consuming application alone.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Binary references will ensure that concurrent development on the class library project will have no impact on the consuming application as a stable version of the binary will be referenced rather than an influx version. It would be the decision of the project lead whether or not to incorporate a newer release of the component if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Finally a short story for the record.
  In 1968, the Communications of the ACM
  published a text of mine under the
  title "&lt;em&gt;The goto statement considered
  harmful&lt;/em&gt;", which in later years would
  be most frequently referenced,
  regrettably, however, often by authors
  who had seen no more of it than its
  title, which became a cornerstone of
  my fame by becoming a template: we
  would see all sorts of articles under
  the title "X considered harmful" for
  almost any X, including one titled
  "Dijkstra considered harmful". But
  what had happened? I had submitted a
  paper under the title "&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A case against
  the goto statement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;", which, in order
  to speed up its publication, the
  editor had changed into a "letter to
  the Editor", and in the process he had
  given it a new title of his own
  invention! The editor was Niklaus
  Wirth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well thought out classic paper about this topic, to be matched to that of Dijkstra, is &lt;a href="http://archive.rapidpacket.com/p261-knuth.pdf"&gt;Structured Programming with go to Statements&lt;/a&gt;, by Donald E. Knuth. Reading both helps to reestablish context and a non-dogmatic understanding of the subject. In this paper, Dijkstra's opinion on this case is reported and is even more strong:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Donald E. Knuth:&lt;/em&gt; I believe that by presenting such a
  view I am not in fact disagreeing
  sharply with Dijkstra's ideas, since
  he recently wrote the following:
  "Please don't fall into the trap of
  believing that I am terribly
  dogmatical about [the go to
  statement]. &lt;strong&gt;I have the uncomfortable
  feeling that others are making a
  religion out of it, as if the
  conceptual problems of programming
  could be solved by a single trick, by
  a simple form of coding discipline!&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using it to update state - like a GET of &lt;code&gt;delete.php?id=5&lt;/code&gt; to delete a page - is very risky.  People found that out when Google's web accelerator started prefetching URLs on pages - it hit all the 'delete' links and wiped out peoples' data.

&lt;p&gt;However, one thing we've looked into is to reference the binary files, to gain all the advantages you note, but have the binaries built by a common build system where the source code is in a common location, accessible from all developer machines (at least if they're sitting on the network at work), so that any debugging can in fact dive into library code, if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, on the same note, we've also tagged a lot of the base classes with appropriate attributes in order to make the debugger skip them completely, because any debugging you do in your own classes (at the level you're developing) would only be vastly outsized by code from the base libraries. This way when you hit the &lt;em&gt;Step Into&lt;/em&gt; debugging shortcut key on a library class, you resurface into the next piece of code at your current level, instead of having to wade through tons of library code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, I definitely vote up (in SO terms) your comments about keeping proven library code out of sight for the normal developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if I load the global solution file, that contains all the projects and basically, just everything, ReSharper 4 seems to have some kind of coronary problem, as Visual Studio practically comes to a stand-still.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There is a review machine with an absurd fiber-channel-RAID-array that can play 2K files direct from the array easily. The issue is with the artist-workstations, so it wouldn't be one $4000 RAID array, it'd be hundreds..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, if you can accept a limit of ~30GB, then maybe a single 36GB SSD drive would be enough?  Those go for ~US$1k each I think, and the data rates might be enough.  That very well maybe cheaper than a pure RAM approach.  There are smaller sizes available, too.  If ~60GB is enough you could probably get away with a JBOD array of 2 for double the cost, and skip the RAID controller.  Be sure only to look at the higher end SSD options--the low end is filled with glorified memory sticks.  :P&lt;/p&gt;

Even if you don't follow &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST"&gt;RESTful&lt;/a&gt; principles, a lot can be gained from learning about REST and how a resource oriented approach works. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A RESTful application will use GETs for operations which are both &lt;em&gt;safe&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;idempotent&lt;/em&gt;. A safe operation is an operation which does not change the data requested. An idempotent operation is one in which the result will be the same no matter how many times you request it. It stands to reason that, as GETs are used for &lt;em&gt;safe&lt;/em&gt; operations they are automatically also &lt;em&gt;idempotent&lt;/em&gt;. Typically a GET is used for retrieving a resource (a question and its associated answers on stack overflow for example) or collection of resources. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A RESTful app will use PUTs (I know the question was about GET and POST, but I'll return to POST in a second) for operations which are &lt;em&gt;not safe&lt;/em&gt; but which &lt;em&gt;are idempotent&lt;/em&gt;. Typically a PUT is used for editing a resource (editing a question or an answer on stack overflow for example). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A POST would be used for any operation which is &lt;em&gt;neither safe or idempotent&lt;/em&gt;. Typically a POST would be used to create a new resource for example creating a NEW SO question (though in some designs a PUT would be used for this also). If you run the POST twice you would end up creating TWO new questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's also a DELETE operation, but I'm guessing I can leave that there :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practical terms modern web browsers typically only support GET and POST reliably (you can perform all of these operations via javascript calls, but in terms of entering data in forms and pressing submit you've generally got the two options). In a RESTful application the POST will often be overriden to provide the PUT and DELETE calls also. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, even if you are not following RESTful principles, it can be useful to think in terms of using GET for retrieving / viewing information and POST for creating / editing  information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should never use GET for an operation which alters data. If a search engine crawls a link to your evil op, or the client bookmarks it could spell big trouble. &lt;/p&gt;

It can cause errors in places that don't appear to be related to the goto statement, so it makes code maintenance more difficult. If you think you need a goto statement, you're wrong :) and you should instead rethink your code construction. This is why modern programming languages have put alot of effort into giving you readable, maintainable flow control constructs, and exception handling mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm also going to disagree with lassevk. Since goto is abused more than correctly used, I believe it has no place in a well designed language. Even for goto's "ideal" uses, the other ways of doing it which require more code should be preferred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get is used to pull data from the server, where an update action shouldn't be needed.  The idea being is that you should be able to use the same GET request over and over and have the same information returned.  The URL has the get information in the query string, because it was meant to be able to be easily sent to other systems and people like a address on where to find something.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post is supposed to be used (at least by the REST architecture which the web is kinda based on) for pushing information to the server/telling the server to perform an action.  Examples like: Update this data, Create this record.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm creating a custom Information Management Policy in MOSS. I've implemented IPolicyFeature, and my policy feature happily registers itself by configuring a new SPItemEventReceiver. All new items in my library fire the events as they should, and it all works fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IPolicyFeature also has a method ProcessListItem, which is supposed to retroactively apply the policy to items that were already in the library (at least, it's supposed to do that for as long as it keeps returning &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;). Except it doesn't. It only applies the policy to the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; item in the library, and I have absolutely no idea why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn't seem to be throwing an exception, and it really does return true from processing that first item, and I can't think what else to look at. Anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Cory's answer, below, set me on the right track. Something else was indeed failing -- I didn't find out what, since my windbg-fu isn't what it should be, but I suspect it was something like "modifying a collection while it's being iterated over". My code was modifying the SPListItem that's passed into ProcessListItem, and then calling SystemUpdate on it; as soon as I changed the code so that it created its own variable (pointing at the exact same SPListItem) and used that, the problem went away...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Depending on the complexity of the tests, migrating tests from JUnit3 to TestNG can be done somewhat automatically with sed and creating a base class to replace TestCase that static imports all of the TestNG assert methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have info on my migration from JUnit to TestNG &lt;a href="http://www.philvarner.com/blog/2008/01/30/testng-migration/" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.philvarner.com/blog/2008/02/10/testng-part-2/" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

This allows the library to have it's own build processes, QA testing, etc. When QA (or whomever) "blesses" a release of the library, it's copied to a central location available to all developers. It's then up to each project to decide which version of the library to consume by copying the binaries to a project folder and using binary references in the projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that is important is to create debug symbol (pdb) files with each build of the library and make those available as well. The other option is to actually create a local symbol store on your network and have each developer add that symbol store to their VS configuration. This would allow you to debug through the code and still have the benefits of usinng binary references.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the benefits you mention for project references, I don't agree with your second point. To me, it's important that the consuming projects explicitly know which version of the common library they are consuming and for them to take a deliberate step to upgrade that version. This is the best way to guarantee that you don't accidentally pick up changes to the library that haven't been completed or tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you're grabbing resources and using semaphores or mutexes, you have to grab them in order and you should always release them in the opposite manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some code requires a very odd pattern of grabbing these resources, and you can't just write an easily maintained and understood control structure to correctly handle both the grabbing and releasing of these resources to avoid deadlock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's always possible to do it right without goto, but in this case and a few others Goto is actually the better solution primarily for readability and maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;

I want to run a web application on php and mysql, using the CakePHP framework. And to keep the threshold of using the site at a very low place, I want to not use the standard login with username/password. (And I don't want to hassle my users with something like OpenID either. Goes to user type.) But everyone has email. So I'm thinking that the users shall be able to log in by sending an email to login@domain.com with no subject or content required. And they will get, in reply, an email with a link that will log them in (it will contain a hash). Also I will let the users do some actions without even visiting the site at all, just send an email with command@domain.com and the command will be carried out. I will assume that the users and their email providers takes care of their email account security and as such there is no need for it on my site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, how do I go from an email is sent to an account that is not read by humans to there being fired off some script (basically a "dummy browser client" calls an url( and the cakephp will take care of the rest)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never used a cron job before, but I do think I understand their purpose or how they generally work. I can not have the script be called by random people visiting the site, as that solution won't work for several reasons. I think I would like to hear more about the possibility of having the script be run as response to an email coming in, if anyone has any input at all on that. If it's run as a cron job it would only check every X minutes and users would get a lag in their response (if i understand it correctly). Since there will be different email addresses for different commands, like &lt;strong&gt;login&lt;/strong&gt;@domain.com and I know what to do and how to do it to based on the sender email, i dont even need the content, subject or any other headers from the email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of worry about security of this application, I understand the issues, but without giving away my concept, I dont think it is a big issue for what I am doing. Also about the usability issue, there really isnt any. It's just gonna be login to provide changes on a users profile if/when they need that and one other command. And this is the main email and is very easy to remember and the outset of this whole concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A coworker of mine said the only reason to use a GOTO is if you programmed yourself so far into a corner that it is the only way out.  In other words, proper design ahead of time and you won't need to use a GOTO later.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought this comic illustrates that beautifully "I could restructure the program's flow, or use one little 'GOTO' instead."  A GOTO is a weak way out when you have weak design.  &lt;em&gt;Velociraptors prey on the weak&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

Alternatively, you should check the mailserver if it can run a script when a mail arrives (i.e. see if it's possible to put a spamfilter-script in and "abuse" that functionality to call your script instead).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With pure PHP, you're mostly out of luck as something needs to trigger the script. On a Pagewith a LOT of traffic, you could have your index.php or whatever do the check, but when no one visits your site for quite some time, then the mail will not be sent, and you have to be careful of "race conditions" when multiple people are accessing the script at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; Just keep one usability flaw in mind: People with Multiple PCs and without an e-Mail Client on every one. For example, I use 4 PCs, but only 1 (my main one) has a Mail Client installed, and I use Webmail to check the other ones. Now, logging in and sending a mail through Webmail is not the greatest usability - in order to use YOUR site, I first have to log in to ANOTHER site, compose a mail through the crappy interface most Webmail tools have and wait for answer. Could as well use OpenID there :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking about your need to have users send certain site commands by email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wouldn't it be easier to have a single address that multiple commands can be sent to rather than having multiple addresses?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the security concerns are pretty valid too.  Unless the commands are non-destructive or aren't doing anything user-specific, the system will be wide open to anyone who knows how to spoof an email address (which would be everyone :) ).&lt;/p&gt;

First, are you developing on the box where you might be able to use Visual Studio to debug? So just stepping through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming that's not the case - what I'd do is fire up WinDBG and attach it to the process just before I registered the policy. Turn on first chance exceptions so that it breaks whenever they occur. you can do that by issuing the command "sxe clr" once it is broken in. Here's a little more info about WinDBG:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I'd do is then watch for First Chance exceptions to be thrown, and do a !PrintException to see what is going on. My guess is that there is an exception being thrown somewhere that is causing the app to stop processing the other items. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does the logic look like for your ProcessListItem? Have you tried just doing a return true to make sure it works?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is some code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First create the HttpHandler:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;%@ WebHandler Language="C#" Class="ImageHandler" %&amp;gt;

using System.Drawing;
using System.Drawing.Imaging;
using System.IO;
using System.Web;

public class ImageHandler : IHttpHandler
{    
    public void ProcessRequest (HttpContext context)
    {
        context.Response.Clear();

        if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(context.Request.QueryString["id"]))
        {
            int id = Int32.Parse(context.Request.QueryString["id"]);

            // Now you have the id, do what you want with it, to get the right image
            // More than likely, just pass it to the method, that builds the image
            Image image = GetImage(id);

            // Of course set this to whatever your format is of the image
            context.Response.ContentType = "image/jpeg";
            // Save the image to the OutputStream
            image.Save(context.Response.OutputStream, ImageFormat.Jpeg);
        }
        else
        {
            context.Response.ContentType = "text/html";
            context.Response.Write("&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Need a valid id&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;");
        }
    }

    public bool IsReusable
    {
        get
        {
            return false;
        }
   }

   private Image GetImage(int id)
   {
       // Not sure how you are building your MemoryStream
       // Once you have it, you just use the Image class to 
       // create the image from the stream.
       MemoryStream stream = new MemoryStream();
       return Image.FromStream(stream);
   }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, just call it inside your aspx page where you are using the asp:Image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;%@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true"  CodeFile="Default.aspx.cs" Inherits="_Default" %&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;head runat="server"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;form id="form1" runat="server"&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;asp:Image ID="myImage" ImageUrl="~/ImageHandler.ashx?id=1" runat="server" /&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Embedded content must be extracted and decoded before changes may be made, then re-encoded and re-embedded afterwards.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cookies are not supported.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Information that is embedded more than once is redownloaded as part of the containing file, and thus does not benefit from the browser's cache.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Browsers may limit URI lengths, creating an effective maximum data size. For example, URIs in previous versions of Opera had limits of 4kB, and 32kB for IE8 Beta 1[citation needed]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data is included as a simple stream, and many processing environments (such as web browsers) may not support using containers (such as multipart/alternative or message/rfc822) to provide greater complexity such as metadata, data compression, or content negotiation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Microsoft's Internet Explorer, through version 7 (some 70% of the market as of 2008 Q2), lacks support.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The better Approach is to use a separate "Image.aspx" Page which takes and outputs your MemoryStream, kinda like I did in my Photo Album software that i've created when I started learning ASP.net:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://souvenance.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/souvenance/trunk/Souvenance.Web/Image.aspx.cs?revision=100&amp;amp;view=markup" rel="nofollow"&gt;(Don't laugh, that was my first attempt at ASP.net :-)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Agreed on ASHX, the code above is just to show one sample implementation. When I come around to update the Photo Album, it will use ASHX for that.&lt;/p&gt;

Do whatever makes sense for your particular match (html encode) and the string you return will replace the entire text of the match in the input string. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: Lets say you wanted to find all the places where there are two numbers being added (in text) and you want to replace the expression with the actual number. You can't do that with a strict regex approach, but you can when you throw in a MatchEvaluator it becomes easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value in which you're interested is not hardware-bound in practice and can vary from platform to platform and perhaps system build to system build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The correct thing to do is to call &lt;code&gt;sysconf&lt;/code&gt; and ask it for "ARG_MAX" or "_POSIX_ARG_MAX".  I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; that's the POSIX-compliant solution anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

If you don't sign it, then users will get a scary "Unknown Publisher" warning dialog the first time they run your application. If you've signed it with a &lt;strong&gt;certificate from a trusted authority&lt;/strong&gt;, then they see a dialog that's less scary. As far as I know, signing with a certificate you generate yourself doesn't affect the "Unknown Publisher" warning. &lt;a href="http://www.instantssl.com/code-signing/code-signing-technical.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Instant SSL from Comodo&lt;/a&gt; has examples of the dialogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some subtler differences. You have to sign an assembly before it can be installed in the global assembly cache (GAC) where it can be shared by multiple applications. Signing is integral to code access security (CAS), but I haven't found anyone who could get CAS working. I'm pretty sure that both the GAC and CAS work fine with certificates you generate yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/#defaulting"&gt;namespace spec&lt;/a&gt; says (&lt;em&gt;emphasis&lt;/em&gt; mine):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A default namespace declaration applies to all unprefixed &lt;em&gt;element&lt;/em&gt; names within its scope. Default namespace declarations do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; apply directly to &lt;em&gt;attribute&lt;/em&gt; names; the interpretation of unprefixed attributes is determined by the element on which they appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a reason that most XML vocabularies use non-namespaced attributes:&lt;br /&gt;
When your elements have a namespace and those elements have attributes, then there can be no confusion: the attributes belong to your element, which belongs to your namespace. Adding a namespace prefix to the attributes would just make everything more verbose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why do namespaced attributes exist?&lt;br /&gt;
Because some vocabularies do useful work with mostly attributes, and can do this when mixed in with other vocabularies. The best known example is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLink"&gt;XLink&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, W3C XML Schema has an all too easy way (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;schema attributeFormDefault="qualified"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) of declaring your attributes as being in a namespace, forcing you to prefix them in your documents, &lt;em&gt;even&lt;/em&gt; when you use a default namespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;TextInput myInput;

Use a separate boolean to track if you're showing the hint or not so you can differentiate between the user manually typing your "hint" text as actual content.  Similarly, you only want to clear the contents of the input box if the hint is being displayed so you don't get rid of user input accidentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's no intrinsic COBOL function to determine the number of trailing spaces in a string, but there is one to determine the number of leading spaces in a string.

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most comprehensive approach would be to load the bulk of the applet in a different class loader (use java.net.URLClassLoader.newInstance). Then use a WeakHashMap to associate class loader with an applet. If you could split most of the code into a common class loader (as a parent of each per-applet class loader) and into the normal applet codebase, that would be faster but more work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other hacks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've got an Access table that has five fields: id, ename, position, phone, and email...each one is plain text field with 50 characters, save for position which is 255 and id which is an autoincrement field.  I'm using a VB.NET to read data from an Excel table, which gets pushed into a simple class that's used to fill out that query.  I do the same thing with two other tables, whose data are pulled from a DB2 table and a MySQL table through.  The other two work, but this simple INSERT loop keeps failing, so I don't think it's my "InsertNoExe" function that handles all the OleDb stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

The actual class may be a DogLeg, but the point is to decouple so the user of Dog doesn't have to know about DogLegs, they only need to know about Legs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Dog : Animal
{
  public override DogLeg GetLeg() {...}

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; if(a instanceof Dog){
       DogLeg dl = (DogLeg)a.GetLeg();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it defeats the purpose of programing to the abstract type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason to hide DogLeg is because the GetLeg function in the abstract class returns an Abstract Leg. If you are overriding the GetLeg you must return a Leg.  Thats the point of having a method in an abstract class.  To propagate that method to it's childern.   If you want the users of the Dog to know about DogLegs make a method called GetDogLeg and return a DogLeg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you COULD do as the question asker wants to, then every user of Animal would need to know about ALL animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think your perhaps misunderstanding inheritance.  Dog.GetLeg() will return a DogLeg object.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class Dog{
    public Leg GetLeg(){
         DogLeg dl = new DogLeg(super.GetLeg());
         //set dogleg specific properties
    }
}


    Animal a = getDog();
    Leg l = a.GetLeg();
    l.kick();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the actual method called will be Dog.GetLeg(); and DogLeg.Kick() (I'm assuming a method Leg.kick() exists)  there for, the declared return type being DogLeg is unneccessary, because that is what returned, even if the return type for Dog.GetLeg() is Leg.&lt;/p&gt;

You can also try adding something like an atexit or on_exit handler.  Your execution environment may be bizarre or corrupt when you enter these functions, of course, so be careful of how much you presume a sane environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, when using regular try-catch pairs you can consider using function try blocks as opposed to opening a try block in the body of a function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int foo(int x) try {
  // body of foo
} catch (...) {
   // be careful what's done here!
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;they're a relatively unknown chunk of C++ and may in some cases offer recovery even in the event of partial (small scale) stack corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, yes, you'll probably want to investigate which signals you can continuably handle on your own or on which you might abort, and if you want less handling mechanisms in place, you might consider call the none-throwing version of the new operator, and compiling to not generate floating point exceptions if needed (you can always check isnan(.), isfinite(.), on FP results to protect yourself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On that last note, be careful:  I've notice that the floating point result classification functions can be in different headers under linux and windows... so you may have to conditionalize those includes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're feeling puckish, write it all using setjmp and longjmp (that's a joke...).&lt;/p&gt;

As we add more applications, we simply integrate them into the HTTP_AUTH system where practical.  For security, you can run HTTP_AUTH over SSL.  The basic steps are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Configure the .htaccess to specify the authentication type.  We use MySQL in production but you could have a simple htpasswd file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the WordPress directory's .htaccess file add the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
  &amp;lt;Files wp-login.php&amp;gt;
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "Restricted Access"
    AuthUserFile /some/path/to/htpasswd
    Require valid-user
  &amp;lt;/Files&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the WordPress wp-admin/ directory's .htaccess add the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Restricted Access"
  AuthUserFile /some/path/to/htpasswd
  Require valid-user
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the MediaWiki directory's .htaccess file add the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Restricted Access"
  AuthUserFile /some/path/to/htpasswd
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then install the &lt;a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:HttpAuth" rel="nofollow"&gt;HttpAuth&lt;/a&gt; extension for MediaWiki and the &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/http-authentication/" rel="nofollow"&gt;HTTP Authentication&lt;/a&gt; plugin for WordPress and configure.  We had to make some slight modifications to the MediaWiki extension as our hosting environment does not provide mod_php but if you have mod_php it will work out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that our environment is a private intranet so everyone is authenticated.  The above .htaccess files will work for publicly viewable blogs but some additional tweaking may be required for the MediaWiki .htaccess depending on whether you want everyone to be required to be authenticated or not and if the site is publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is the order of iteration&lt;/em&gt; - if you are just using &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt;, then strictly speaking, there are &lt;strong&gt;no ordering guarantees&lt;/strong&gt;.  So you shouldn't really rely on the ordering given by any implementation.  However, the &lt;a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/SortedMap.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;code&gt;SortedMap&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; interface extends &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; and provides exactly what you are looking for - implementations will aways give a consistent sort order.&lt;/p&gt;

So potentially this can remove the need for iterating in the first place - you might be able to find the specific &lt;code&gt;entry&lt;/code&gt; you are after using the &lt;code&gt;higherEntry&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;lowerEntry&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ceilingEntry&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;floorEntry&lt;/code&gt; methods.  The &lt;code&gt;descendingMap&lt;/code&gt; method even gives you an explicit method of &lt;strong&gt;reversing the traversal order&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a changelist (or label) is not given, use &lt;code&gt;p4 counter change&lt;/code&gt; to get the current change number, and record it. But you still need to &lt;em&gt;sync everything using that change number.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think you can achieve exactly what you want, because in general, an entire workspace isn't synced to a particular changelist number. One can explicitly sync some files to older revisions, and then a single changelist number is meaningless. That's why a fresh &lt;code&gt;sync&lt;/code&gt; is required to ensure that a single changelist number accurately represents the code version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the comments: Yes, my answer is intended for use by configuration managers preparing a build to give to QA. Our developers don't normally sync as part of a build; they do a build prior to submitting&amp;mdash;so that they can make sure their changes don't break the build or tests. In that context, we don't bother to embed a repository label.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With your approach, you are making the assumption that your whole workspace was synced to head at the time of your last changelist submission, and that changelist included all of your open files. It's too easy to be mistaken in those assumptions, hard to detect, and horribly expensive in terms of lost time. On the other hand, solving the problem is easy, with no drawbacks. And because a changelist number can be explicitly specified, it doesn't matter what revision you need or how quickly the codebase is changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Perforce, when you branch a file, Perforce "remembers" where it came from and which revisions have been "integrated" into the two versions. It also has some storage optimizations in the repository so that a branch copy doesn't really materialize until someone makes a change in the branch, and then (if I understand correctly), it uses diffs against the base copy, just like revisions within a branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does C# let you specify different data types for the &lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;set()&lt;/code&gt; methods? If not, I would split them into actual &lt;code&gt;Leg get_leg()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;set_leg(DogLeg)&lt;/code&gt; functions. Otherwise one of two things will happen: 1) overspecification of &lt;code&gt;get_leg()&lt;/code&gt; 2) underspecification of &lt;code&gt;set_leg()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You mention servicing "1000+ client users" but to gauge if your services can perform at that level you'll also need to have some estimated usage figures, which will help you calculate some simpler stats such as the number of requests per second your app needs to handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having just finished working on a WCF project we managed to get 400 requests per second on our test hardware, which combined with our expected usage pattern of each user making 300 requests a day indicated we could handle an average of 100,000 users a day (assuming a flat usage graph across the day). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, since it's fairly common to make the WCF service code stateless, it's pretty easy to scale out the actual WCF code by adding additional boxes, which means the overall performance of your system is much more likely to be limited by your business logic and persistence layer than it is by WCF.&lt;/p&gt;

However, I think you can improvise a fairly elegant throttling function based on what you are already doing. Essentially (I don't have a Windows dev machine handy):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pick a default amount of time the thread will sleep each iteration.  Then, on each iteration (or on every nth iteration, such that the throttling function doesn't itself become a significant CPU load),&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compute the amount of CPU time your thread used since the last time your throttling function was called (I'll call this dCPU).  You can use the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms683237.aspx"&gt;GetThreadTimes()&lt;/a&gt; API to get the amount of time your thread has been executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compute the amount of real time elapsed since the last time your throttling function was called (I'll call this dClock).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dCPU / dClock is the percent CPU usage (of one CPU).  If it is higher than you want, increase your sleep time, if lower, decrease the sleep time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have your thread sleep for the computed time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on how your watchdog computes CPU usage, you might want to use &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms683213(VS.85).aspx"&gt;GetProcessAffinityMask()&lt;/a&gt; to find out how many CPUs the system has.  dCPU / (dClock * CPUs) is the percentage of total CPU time available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will still have to pick some magic numbers for the initial sleep time and the increment/decrement amount, but I think this algorithm could be tuned to keep a thread running at fairly close to a determined percent of CPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm assuming you loaded your XML into an XMLDocument, doing so allows you to use XPath Selectors, or just walk through the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something like this would walk from whatever element back up to the top using recursion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public XmlNode WalkToTopNode (XmlNode CurrentNode)
{
    if (CurrentNode.ParentNode == null)
     return CurrentNode;
    else
     return WalkToTopNode(CurrentNode.ParentNode);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using recursion to find a node by ID could be done somewhat like this (Note, I typed this in the textbox, it may be wrong):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public XmlNode GetElementById (string id, XmlNode node)
{
    if (node.Attributes["id"] != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; node.Attributes["id"].InnerText == id)

      return GetElementById(id, childNode);
     }
    }

    return null;    
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

In my experience, this sort of thing typically occurs when package refactoring operations have been chained together in Eclipse without commits in between.  Typically, Subversion doesn't handle it well when you copy/move a locally copied/moved file or folder, although I think version 1.5 may handle it better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid this in the future, commit between such steps.  If you'd like to hide the intervening commits then I'd recommend doing the multi-step refactoring on a branch and then merging the changes back into the mainline in that single commit you were after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it's not too much work, then I'd recommend getting back to a clean working copy and redoing your changes, committing after each step.  If you're happy to lose the history, i.e. allowing the new &lt;code&gt;IntegerType.java&lt;/code&gt; to not be linked at all to the old &lt;code&gt;IntegerType.java&lt;/code&gt;, then you could take the approach suggested by BCS:&lt;/p&gt;

This could reduce the chance that a student who knows the answers will be free to help one who doesn't (since they both need to be taking the test at the same time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it's math-related, use different numbers for different students.  In general, try to have different questions for different copies of the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you get to design the entire course: try to have some online homeworks as well, so that you can build a profile for each student, such as a statistical analysis of how often they use certain common words and punctuations.  Some students use semi-colons often; others never, for example.  When they take the test you get a good idea of whether or not it's really them typing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could also ask a couple questions you know they don't know.  For example, list 10 questions and say they must answer any 6 out of the 10.  But make 3 of the questions based on materials not taught in class.  If they choose 2 or 3 of these, you have good reason to be suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, use an algorithm to compare for similar answers.  Do a simple hash to get rid of small changes.  For example, hash an answer to a list of lower-cased 3-grams (3 words in a row), alphabetize it, and then look for many collisions between different users.  This may sound like an obvious technique, but as a teacher I can assure you this will catch a surprising number of cheaters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the real trouble is to actually enforce punishment against cheaters.  At the colleges where I have taught, if a student objects to your punishment (such as flunking them on the test in question), the administration will usually give the student something back, such as a positive grade change.  I guess this is because the student('s parents) have paid the university a lot of money, but it is still very frustrating as a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete the project from the workspace (keep "Delete project contents on disk" unchecked)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File &gt; Import... &gt; General &gt; Existing Projects into Workspace&lt;/li&gt;

What you want to do for performance is keep the size of the result set (working set) as small as possible for as long as possible.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since both joins match on the first table, changing up the order won't effect the accuracy of the results.  Therefore, you probably want to do the INNER JOIN before the LEFT JOIN:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT * 
FROM TblA
INNER JOIN DifferentDbCatalog.dbo.TblC on TblA.ID = TblC.TblAID
LEFT JOIN freetexttable ( TblB, *, 'query' ) on TblA.ID = [Key]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a practical matter, the query optimizer &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be smart enough to compile to use the faster option, regardless of which order you specified for the joins. However, it's good practice to pretend that you have a dumb query optimizer, and that query operations happen in order. This helps future maintainers spot potential errors or assumptions about the nature of the tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the optimizer should re-write things, this probably isn't good enough to fully explain the behavior you're seeing, so you'll still want to &lt;em&gt;examine the execution plan&lt;/em&gt; used for each query, and probably add an index as suggested earlier.  This is still a good principle to learn, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YSlow, Fiddler, and Firebug are not the best tools to monitor parsing speed.  Unless they've been updated very recently, they don't separate the amount of time required to fetch JS over HTTP or load from cache versus the amount of time spent parsing the actual JS payload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parse speed is slightly difficult to measure, but we've chased this metric a number of times on projects I've worked on and the impact on pageloads were significant even with ~500k of JS.  Obviously the older browsers suffer the most...hopefully Chrome, TraceMonkey and the like help resolve this situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suggestion:&lt;/strong&gt; Depending on the type of traffic you have at your site, it may be well worth your while to split up your JS payload so some large chunks of JS that will never be used on a the most popular pages are never sent down to the client.  Of course, this means that when a new client hits a page where this JS is needed, you'll have to send it over the wire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it may well be the case that, say, 50% of your JS is never needed by 80% of your users due to your traffic patterns.  If this is so, you should definitely user smaller, packaged JS payloads only on pages where the JS is necessary.  Otherwise 80% of your users will suffer unnecessary JS parsing penalties on &lt;em&gt;every single pageload&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;/strong&gt; It's difficult to find the proper balance of JS caching and smaller, packaged payloads, but depending on your traffic pattern it's definitely well worth considering a technique other than smashing all of your JS into every single pageload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;*EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; To clarify, I would like to get the current CPU usage for the whole system, not just the Java process(es).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; The SIGAR API provides all the functionality I'm looking for in one package, so it's the best answer to my question so far. However, due it being licensed under the GPL, I cannot use it for my original purpose (a closed source, commercial product). It's possible that Hyperic may license SIGAR for commercial use, but I haven't looked into it. For my GPL projects, I will definitely consider SIGAR in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my current needs, I'm leaning towards the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for cpu usage, OperatingSystemMXBean.getSystemLoadAverage() / OperatingSystemMXBean.getAvailableProcessors() (load average per cpu)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for memory, OperatingSystemMXBean.getTotalPhysicalMemorySize() and OperatingSystemMXBean.getFreePhysicalMemorySize()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for disk space, File.getTotalSpace() and File.getUsableSpace()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limitations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The getSystemLoadAverage() and disk space querying methods are only available under Java 6. Also, some JMX functionality may not be available to all platforms (i.e. it's been reported that getSystemLoadAverage() returns -1 on Windows).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 2011-08-18:&lt;/strong&gt;
Although originally licensed under GPL, it &lt;a href="http://forums.hyperic.com/jiveforums/thread.jspa?threadID=11426&amp;amp;tstart=0"&gt;has been changed&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://support.hyperic.com/display/SIGAR/Home#Home-license"&gt;Apache 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, which can generally be used for closed source, commercial products.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I understand that these use phonetic input converted to written characters.
  How does that work on the web?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The input is done by a class of software called an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input%5Fmethod%5Feditor"&gt;IME (Input Method Editor)&lt;/a&gt; on Windows, Mac, and Linux(e.g. SCIM). When an IME is turned on, the input from the keyboard first goes to the IME, and the user gets to pick the correct kanji/hiragana combo. When the user commits by hitting return key, the IME types in the kanji/hiragana into the web browser using the current encoding. Encoding situation was a big mess, but if you are writing a web app, go with an encoding of Unicode. I suggest UTF-8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Unicode savvy web browser and OS combo handles multiple languages. For example, one can use English normal version of Firefox to browse and post to a Japanese website. From the browsers point of view, it's just an array of "bla bla bla" in Unicode. In other words, if the event fires up in English, the same event should fire up in CJKV if you use a Unicode variant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What conventions do users of these top-down languages expect online?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CJKV readers expect left-to-right online. Math and science textbooks are written from left-to-right. Most word processors, including localized version of Word, write left-to-right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What effect does their dual-input (phonetic typing + conversion) have on web controls?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part you should not have to worry about it, unless you are trapping keyboard events. For example, I hate using Japanese keyboard with bunch of extra keyboard. So, when I have to assign IME on/off command to some key on US keyboard. I personally use right-Alt. Also, spacebar and enter key is used during conversion, but not sure if these events are passed to browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want, I can test out your website. (my user name)@gmail.&lt;/p&gt;

You are then looking to capture the URL to which the user has browsed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something to keep in mind.  Since the URL is to an external source, you will be limited in how much you can interact with this iframe via javascript (or an client side access for that matter), this is known as browser cross-domain security, as apparently you have discovered.  There are clever work arounds, as presented here &lt;a href="http://www.hackszine.com/blog/archive/2007/11/crossdomain_crossframe_javascr.html" rel="nofollow" title="Cross-domain, cross-frame Javascript"&gt;Cross-domain, cross-frame Javascript&lt;/a&gt;, although I do not think this work around applies in this case. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About all you can access is the location, as you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would suggest making the code presented more resilitant and less error prone.  Try browsing the web sometime with IE or FF configured to show javascript errors.  You will be surprised just how many javascript errors are thrown, largely because there is a lot of error prone javascript out there, which just continues to proliferate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This solution assumes that the iframe in question is the same "window" context where you are running the javascript.  (Meaning, it is not embedded within another frame or iframe, in which case, the javascript code gets more involved, and you likely need to recursively search through the window hierarchy.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iframe name='frmExternal' id='frmExternal' src='http://www.stackoverflow.com'&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/frame&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;input type='text' id='txtUrl' /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;input type='button' id='btnGetUrl' value='Get URL' onclick='GetIFrameUrl();' /&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;script language='javascript' type='text/javascript'&amp;gt;
function GetIFrameUrl()
{
    if (!document.getElementById)
    {
        return;
    }

    var frm = document.getElementById("frmExternal");
    var txt = document.getElementById("txtUrl");

    if (frm == null || txt == null)
    {
        // not great user feedback but slightly better than obnoxious script errors
       alert("There was a problem with this page, please refresh.");
       return;
    }

    txt.value = frm.src;
}
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not too sure, Never quite got that far in the thought process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another solution might be to extend ListView, and when adding and removing stuff, instead of calling .items.add, and items.remove, you call your other functions.  It would still be possible to add and remove without events being raised, but with a little code review to make sure .items.add and .items.remove weren't called directly, it could work out quite well.  Here's a little example.  I only showed 1 Add function, but there are 6 you would have to implement, if you wanted to have use of all the available add functions. There's also .AddRange, and .Clear that you might want to take a look at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Public Class MonitoredListView
    Inherits ListView

    Public Event ItemAdded()
    Public Event ItemRemoved()

    Public Sub New()
        MyBase.New()
    End Sub

    Public Function AddItem(ByVal Text As String) As ListViewItem
        RaiseEvent ItemAdded()

        MyBase.Items.Add(Text)
    End Function

    Public Sub RemoveItem(ByVal Item As ListViewItem)
        RaiseEvent ItemRemoved()

        MyBase.Items.Remove(Item)
    End Sub

End Class
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire team&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What code should be reviewed? (all code? Big changes? Etc)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one depends.  We review all code changes.  Property and ini changes are left un-reviewed unless we deem it necessary after looking at the code.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where should the review take place? (Does it have to take place in person?)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it must take place in person.  Besides looking over code, you can pick up valuable information on general coding practices, IDE tricks, the list goes on.  Reviewing in person also gives the coder a chance to explain why they did something that way, leaves more room for debate.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When should reviews take place? (Incrementally? Before check-ins?)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do ours a week before the code is to be put into production.  Everything is checked in by that point, and it leaves plenty of time for any issues to be corrected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why should code be reviewed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list for this question is ginormous.  First and foremost is to catch code that can produce errors or bugs in production.  Other things like catching non-standardized code, sloppy code, anti-patterns.  Pretty much you name it.&lt;/p&gt;

Just the current highest / lowest value +/- 1 would probably be a fine starting point. Once you've got that ordering in there, reordering becomes a case of swapping two values or changing the value for one page to be between two others (you could use floats I guess, but you may need to renumber if you split it too many times).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, once you've got that, you need a UI. I've seen a very simple 'swap this with the one above/below' approach which can be a simple web link or an AJAX call.

&lt;p&gt;Assuming that you are publishing to a Windows 2003 server, I'd suggest trying the slightly less drastic step of stopping and restarting the IIS AppPool in the web site or virtual folder in which the web service runs.  (That way you are not taking all sites that run on the target server offline.)  This too assumes that the web service runs in its own app pool.  Ideally it should, so you keep it isolated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mentor or senior engineer who will look out for bad smells and errors in architectural correctness of the code.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peers on the team or pod working in the same area of code i.e. if you are working on 3d rendering in a computer game, all the other graphics programmers should review the code. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone else whose modules are interfaced by or dependent on the code being submitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What code should be reviewed? (all code? Big changes? Etc)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience all code that is going to be worked on by more that one person (and that's almost all code). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where should the review take place? (Does it have to take place in person?)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reviews are most beneficial when they are interactive and real time. Having said that I think it's important to have a system like CodeReviewer to allow easy distribution of diffs so that reviewers can study the changes more efficiently and more comfortably within their own dev environment, before doing the actual face to face review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm in no way associated with CodeBear, but I've always found my code reviews to be more effective when I've been able to view the changes on my own machine since I've got the IDE and tools and everything else configured just the way I need for me to effectively spelunk the code to see what impact the code changes will have and that is something I can't do if my review is all of 15 minutes at another person's PC watching them scroll through their changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When should reviews take place? (Incrementally? Before check-ins?)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before check ins. I've been in situations where incremental code review amounted to me writing the person's code for them "incrementally" during each review. :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why should code be reviewed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two main reasons come to mind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one is to preserve the quality and consistency of the code base. For any real world code base you will most likely have programmers of varying levels leaving and joining the team that's responsible for maintaining that code base and reviews try to minimize the code base becoming a reflection of the teams dynamics e.g. 2 crappy programmers joined the team last week and now 20 source files have crap in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second reason is to remove tunnel vision assumptions in the code. At some point a code base will become too massive for one programmer to understand it all. And from that point forward everyone working on the code will have their own "slice of reality" about what the code does and how the system works and this will often lead to code being written that's based on naive or wrong assumptions. So having other people bring their view of reality to your code during the review helps reduce this problem of code base myopia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040803120105/http://www.microsoft.com/backstage/bkst_column_46.mspx"&gt;http://web.archive.org/web/20040803120105/http://www.microsoft.com/backstage/bkst_column_46.mspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The .MSPX extension is part of the "Microsoft Network Project," which according to the article above, is designed to give Microsoft's sites a consistent look-and-feel worldwide, as well as keep the design of the site seperate from the content. Here's the gist of the article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The presentation framework includes a custom Web handler built in ASP.NET. Pages that use the presentation framework have the .mspx filename extension, which is registered in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) on the Web servers. When one of the Microsoft.com Web servers receives a request for an .mspx page, this custom Web handler intercepts that call and passes it to the framework for processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The framework first checks to see whether the result is cached. If it is, the page is rendered immediately. If the page is not cached, the handler looks up the URL for that page in the table of contents provided by the site owner (see below) to determine where the XML content for the page is stored. The framework then checks to see if the XML is cached, and either returns the cached content or retrieves the XML from the data store identified in the table of contents file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the file that holds the content for the page, XML tags identify the content template to be used. The framework retrieves the appropriate template and uses a series of XSLTs to assemble the page, including the masthead, the footer, and the primary navigational column, finally rendering the content within the content pane."&lt;/p&gt;

In many cases it will use WMI, but in some cases it may need to read remote registry or remotely execute some command or script on the polled system. This polling will happen at repeating intervals - usually nightly, but can be configured to happen more (or less) frequently. So the poll could happen as often as every 10 minutes or as rarely as once a month. It needs to happen in an automated way, without any human intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These functions will require admin-level access to the polled systems. Now, I expect that in most use cases, there will be a domain, and the polling application can run as a service with Domain Admin (or equivalent) privileges, which means I do not have to worry about storing passwords - the admin setting up the app will define the service's username/password via standard Windows mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there's always a few black sheep out there. The program may run in nondomain environments, or in cases where some polled systems are not members of the domain. In these cases we will have to define a username and password, store them securely, then invoke this user/pass pair at the time we poll that system. So keep in mind - in this case the program being written &lt;em&gt;is the user&lt;/em&gt; who &lt;em&gt;sends&lt;/em&gt; password to the authenticating system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure whether I will need to use a reversible hash which I then decrypt to plaintext at time of use, or if there is some Windows mechanism which would allow me to store and then reuse the hash only. Obviously the second mechanism is preferable; I'd like my program to either &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; know the password's plaintext value, or know it for the shortest amount of time possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need suggestions for smart and secure ways to accomplish this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put these classes in an assembly to test it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class FakeDataClass
{
    public int AnInt
    {
        get;
        set;

    public string AString
    {
        get;
        set;
    }

    public float AFloat
    {
        get;
        set;
    }

    public FKClass AFKReference
    {
        get;
        set;
    }
}

public class FKClass
    {
        public int AFKInt

            get;
            set;
        }
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it generated the following SQL:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CREATE TABLE FakeDataClass
(
         ID BIGINT,
         AnInt BIGINT,
         AString NVARCHAR(255),
         AFloat FLOAT,
         AFKReference BIGINT
)


CREATE TABLE FKClass
(
         ID BIGINT,
         AFKInt BIGINT
)


GO
ALTER TABLE FakeDataClass WITH NOCHECK
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_AFKReference FOREIGN KEY (AFKReference) REFERENCES FKClass(ID)
GO
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some further thoughts...I'd consider adding an attribute such as [SqlTable] to your classes, that way it only generates tables for the classes you want. Also, this can be cleaned up a ton, bugs fixed, optimized (the FK Checker is a joke) etc etc...Just to get you started.&lt;/p&gt;

An unaligned access will cause an exception, but some operating systems will handle the exception by copying from the desired address in software using smaller loads and stores. The application code won't know there was a problem, except that the performance will be very bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIPS has special instructions (lwl and lwr) which can be used to access 32 bit quantities from unaligned addresses. Whenever the compiler can tell that the address is likely unaligned it will use this two instruction sequence instead of a normal lw instruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;x86 can handle unaligned memory accesses in hardware without an exception, but there is still a performance hit of up to 3X compared to aligned accesses.&lt;/p&gt;

There are equivalent unaligned instructions as well, but like Denton says, they're are slower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're using VC++, then besides the #pragma pack directives, you also have the __declspec(align) directives for precise alignment. VC++ documentation also mentions an __aligned_malloc function for specific alignment requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a rule of thumb, unless you are moving data across compilers/languages or are using the SSE instructions, you can probably ignore alignment issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I run a script that iterates through all of the databases, doing a mysqldump and gzip on each to a backup folder, and then backup that folder to tape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, however, means that there is no such thing as &lt;em&gt;incremental&lt;/em&gt; backups, since the nightly dump is a complete dump.  But I would argue that this could be a good thing, since a restore from a &lt;em&gt;full backup&lt;/em&gt; will be a significantly quicker process than restoring from incrementals - and if you are backing up to tape, it will likely mean gathering a number of tapes before you can do a full restore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, whichever backup plan you go with, make sure to do a trial restore to ensure that it works, and get an idea of how long it might take, and exactly what the steps are that you need to go through.&lt;/p&gt;

In this case: are you worried that somebody shuts down the computer and does a forensic analysis of the harddrive? Application memory can also be swapped out, so the simple fact that &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; process has it in memory, makes it potentially possible for it to end in the swap file. What about hibernation? During hibernation the entire content of the memory is written to the harddisk (including the SecureString - and presumably the encryption key!). What if the attacker has access to the system &lt;em&gt;while it's running&lt;/em&gt; and can search through the memory of applications?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general client side security is very tricky and unless you have dedicated hardware (like a TPM chip) it is almost impossible to get right. Two solutions would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you only need to test for equality between two strings (ie: is this string the same as the one I had earlier), store only a (salted) hash value of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the user re-enter the information when it is needed a second time (not very convenient, but security and convenience are opposed to each other)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GET may yeild marginally better performance, some webservers write POST contents to a temporary file before invoking the handler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing to consider is the size limit. GETs are capped by the size of the URL, 1024 bytes by the standard, though browsers may support more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transferring more data than that should use a POST to get better browser compatibility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script is a Python script, which basically runs the following command, and emails the output file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mysqldump -u theuser -p mypassword thedatabase | gzip -9 - | gpg -e -r 12345 -r 23456 &amp;gt; 2008_01_02.tar.gz.gpg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the entire backup. It also has the web-backup part, which just tar/gzips/encrypts the files. It's a fairly small site, so the web backups are much less than 20MB, so can be sent to the GMail account without problem (the MySQL dumps are tiny, about 300KB compressed). It's extremely basic, and won't scale very well. I run it once a week using cron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not quite sure how we're supposed to put longish scripts in answers, so I'll just shove it as a code-block..&lt;/p&gt;

Generally I put a query on each tab, which of course may be hidden. An "update all" causes all the queries to be updated. Then summary tabs show the pretty results from all the individual queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one particularly complex system, a bit of excel vba programmatically changed a query and then walked through the tabs updating each one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, rather than doing screen shots, Excel has a "copy cells as a image" copy that populates the copy buffer with a resizeable image.  This could give you better looking results than a pure screenshot since a screenshot can have various deficiencies depending on pixel density.&lt;/p&gt;

That being said, I have cases where a wise user (ok, me) user needs to just get in there and poke around.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of directly looking at the tables, use MS Access but use queries to narrow down what you're looking at both column wise and row wise.  That will improve the speed.  Then edit the query properties and make sure that the query is No Locks.  That should eliminate any blocking behavior.  You may want to limit the number of rows returned which again will improve the speed.  You can still edit the data in the query as you look at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on what you're looking at, it may also be useful to set up database Views in the SQL Server to do some of the heavy lifting on the server rather than on the client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mercurial&lt;/a&gt; is a similarly lightweight piece of revision control software.  If you are writing your application in python, which is likely since &lt;a href="http://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;python now includes sqlite3&lt;/a&gt;, importing features directly from mercurial's source code should not be too difficult.  Otherwise there's no shame in invoking commandline processes, though this may be clunkier.  Mercurial is not public domain, but it is GPL'd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mercurial is also my personal favorite among modern revision control systems.  It's leaps ahead of CVS and Subversion, and very similar to GIT although somewhat simpler to use.&lt;/p&gt;

Flex is great for writing applications that load and display data, but is a huge overhead if you just want to display charts. If you're worried about delivering the SWF and the data in two separate responses, you should be worrying about the 200-300 K overhead of the Flex framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go with something more lightweight like &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/flot/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Flot&lt;/a&gt; and deliver the JavaScript code that generates the charts along with the data. I don't think Flex is a suitable platform for what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't want to buy a tool, and you need something less flash you could roll your own quite easily. I just found &lt;a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/database/OracleSchemaCompare.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;Schema Compare Tool for Oracle&lt;/a&gt; which looks very simple, and has a nice baseline concept.

I don't think you can expect there to be a library that will generate ranges according to any arbitrary order on string you can come up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can simply define what the successor of any given string is, then the solutions is quite easy. That is, if you have a successor function &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; on strings (e.g. with &lt;code&gt;S('3A') = '4A'&lt;/code&gt;), then something like the following can be used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;s = initial_string
while s != final_string do
  output s
  s = S(s)
output s
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I have used in the past to generate all strings of a given length &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt; and with given range &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; of characters, is the following piece of (pseudo-)code. It can be easily adapted to a wide range of variations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// initialise s with b at every position
for i in [0..l) do
  s[i] = b
done = false
while not done do
  output s
  j = 0
  // if s[j] is e, reset it to b and "add carry"
  while j &amp;lt; l and s[j] == e do
    s[j] = b
    j = j + 1
    if j == l then
      done = true
  if not done then
    s[j] = s[j] + 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, to start at a specific string you need only the change the initialisation. To set the end you only need to change the behaviour for the inner while to separately handle position &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt; (limiting to the character in the end string on that position and if reached decrementing &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

I have a DataAccess project that contains the LINQ to SQL classes, and a website project that is the UI. My database looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User -&gt; MessageDetail &amp;lt;- Message &amp;lt;- MessageCategory&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MessageDetail is a join table that also contains an IsRead flag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of messages is grouped by category. I have two nested ListView controls on the page -- One outputs the group name, while a second one nested inside that is bound to MessageDetails and outputs the messages themselves. In the code-behind for the page listing the messages I have the following code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;protected void MessageListDataSource_Selecting(object sender, LinqDataSourceSelectEventArgs e)
{
    var db = new DataContext();

    // parse the input strings from the web form
    int categoryIDFilter;
    DateTime dateFilter;
    string catFilterString = MessagesCategoryFilter.SelectedValue;
    string dateFilterString = MessagesDateFilter.SelectedValue;
    // TryParse will return default values if parsing is unsuccessful (i.e. if "all" is selected"):
    // DateTime.MinValue for dates, 0 for int
    DateTime.TryParse(dateFilterString, out dateFilter);
    Int32.TryParse(catFilterString, out categoryIDFilter);
    bool showRead = MessagesReadFilter.Checked;

    var messages =
        from detail in db.MessageDetails
        where detail.UserID == (int)Session["UserID"]
        where detail.Message.IsPublished
        where detail.Message.MessageCategoryID == categoryIDFilter || (categoryIDFilter == 0)
        where dateFilter == detail.Message.PublishDate.Value.Date || (dateFilter == DateTime.MinValue)
        // is unread, showRead filter is on, or message was marked read today
        where detail.IsRead == false || showRead || detail.ReadDate.Value.Date == DateTime.Today
        orderby detail.Message.PublishDate descending
        group detail by detail.Message.MessageCategory into categories
        orderby categories.Key.Name
        select new
        {
            MessageCategory = categories.Key,
            MessageDetails = categories.Select(d =&amp;gt; d)
        };

    e.Result = messages;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This code &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt;, but sticking a huge LINQ statement like this in the code-behind for a LinqDataSource control just doesn't sit right with me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like I'm still coding queries into the user interface, only now it's LINQ instead of SQL. However, I feel that building another layer between the L2S classes and the UI would cut back on some of the flexibility of LINQ. Isn't the whole point to reduce the amount of code you write to fetch data?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there some possible middle ground I'm not seeing, or am I just misunderstanding the way LINQ to SQL is supposed to be used? Advice would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Create new table, called TestTable
Table newTable = new Table(db, "TestTable");

This approach doesn't test the GUI obviously, so you could augment the testing with a series of test scripts (here I mean like a word document that says open form 1, and click control 1) that are manually executed.&lt;/p&gt;

Do not expect to much from JRuby's performance. In interpreted mode, it seems to be somewhere in the range of C Ruby. JIT mode &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be faster, but only in theory. In practice, we tried JIT mode on Glassfish for a decently-sized Rails application on a medium-sized server (dual core, 8GB RAM). And the truth is, the JITting took so &lt;em&gt;freakingly&lt;/em&gt; much time, that the server needed 20-30 minutes before it answered the first request. Memory usage was astronomic, profiling did not work because the whole system grinded to halt with a profiler attached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: JRuby has its merits (multithreading, solid platform, easy Java integration), but given that interpreted mode is the only mode that worked for us in practice, it may be expected to be no better performance-wise than C Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first pass over the string is obviously O(n/2) = O(n). The second pass is O(n + combined length of all words / 2) = O(n + n/2) = O(n), which makes this an O(n) algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;reverse string in-place (first iteration over string)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reverse each (reversed) word in-place (another two iterations over string)

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly Coderush has one key/shortcut for all refactorings which makes you much more likely to actually use them. There is side window that shows you what keys to press in order to use the templates as well. I have liked Resharper's searching for usage of a method, but CodeRush has a similar feature ignited by Shift + F12 and you can also simply press Tab on a variable, function etc. to jump to its next usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I've done so far: added a &lt;code&gt;float: left;&lt;/code&gt; style for every span and specified its percentage width (percents are more or less fine, as the server knows at the time of the page generation, how many menu items are there and could divide 100% by this number). This works, except for the case when we have a division remainder (like for 3 elements), in this case I have a one-pixel hole to the right of the parent &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and if I rounding the percents up, the last menu element is wrapped. I also don't really like style generation on the fly, but if there's no other solution, it's fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, you'll want to do more in the &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; blocks than print the stack trace as I did in the example code above.  Remove the &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; blocks to see which method calls from the JavaMail API throw exceptions so you can better see how to properly handle them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I'm fed up with people describing higher-level language structures as &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt; in disguise because they clearly haven't got the point &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Even the advanced continuation control structure in Scheme can be described as a sophisticated goto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is complete nonsense. &lt;em&gt;Every&lt;/em&gt; control structure can be implemented in terms of &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt; but this observation is utterly trivial and useless. &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt; isn't considered harmful because of its positive effects but because of its negative consequences and these have been eliminated by structured programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, saying GOTO is a tool, and as all tools, it can be used and abused is completely off the mark. No modern construction worker would use a rock and claim it is a tool. Rocks have been replaced by hammers. &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt; has been replaced by control structures. If the construction worker were stranded in the wild without a hammer, of course he would use a rock instead. If a programmer has to use an inferior programming language that doesn't have feature X, well, of course she may have to use &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt; instead. But if she uses it anywhere else instead of the appropriate language feature she clearly hasn't understood the language properly and uses it wrongly. It's really as simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be a bit more specific, the application is a strategy game (browser based, just text) that will mostly involve players issuing "orders" that will be stored in the database and processed later, with the results also being stored there (the history of "orders" and the corresponding results will probably get quite big).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;database engine: I was thinking of using MySQL (unless there's a big advantage in using another)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the schema: all I have now are some Django models, and that's far too much detail to post here. And if I start posting schemas this becomes too specific, and I was looking for general tips. For example, consider that I issue "orders" that will be later processed and return a result that I have to store to display some kind of "history". In this case is it better to have a separate table for the "history" or just one that aggregates both the "orders" and the result? I guess I could cache the "history" table, but this would take more space in the database and also more database operations because I would have to constantly create new rows instead of just altering them in the aggregate table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, for your database design I would follow good practices such as adding foreign keys and indexes to data you expect to be used frequently, normalise your data by splitting it into smaller tables and identify which data is to be read frequently and which is to be written frequently and optimise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much more important than your database design for high performance web applications, is your effective use of caching both at the client level through HTML page caching and at the server level through cached data or serving up static files in place of dynamic files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great thing about caching is that it can be added as it is needed, so that when your application does take off then you evolve accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as your historical data is concerned, this is a great thing to cache as you do not expect it to change frequently.  If you wish to produce regular and fairly intensive reports from your data, then it is good practise to put this data into another database so as not to bring your web application to a halt whilst they run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this kind of optimisation really isn't necessary unless you think your application will warrant it.&lt;/p&gt;

yes, that select last(value) SHOULD work, but it doesn't...  My understanding although I can't produce an authorative source is that the last(value) gives the last physical record in the access file, which means it could be the first one timewise but the last one physically.  So I don't think you should use last(value) for anything other than a really bad random row.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[TestFixture]
public class IndexableFileTest
{
   [Test]
   public void Connect_InitializesReadOnlyProperties()
   {
     // ...
   }

   [Test,ExpectedException(typeof(NotInitializedException))]
   public void IsIndexable_ErrorWhenNotConnected()
   {
     // ...
   }

   [Test]
   public void IsIndexable_True()
   {
     // ...
   }

   [Test]
   public void IsIndexable_False()
   {
     // ...
   }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way, you avoid repeating styles that are &lt;em&gt;conceptually&lt;/em&gt; the same, while also making it clear which parts of the document they affect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the emphasis on "conceptually" in that last sentence... This just came up in the comments, so I'm gonna expand on it a bit, since I've seen people making this same mistake over and over again for years - predating even the existence of CSS: &lt;strong&gt;two attributes sharing the same value does not necessarily mean they represent the same &lt;em&gt;concept&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The sky may appear red in the evening, and so do tomatoes - but the sky and the tomato are not red for the same reason, and their colors &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; vary over time independently. By the same token, just because you happen to have two elements in your stylesheet that are given the same color, or size or positioning does not mean they will &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; share these values. A naive designer who uses grouping (as described here) or a variable processor such as SASS or LESS to avoid &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; repetition risks making future changes to styling incredibly error-prone; always focus on the &lt;em&gt;contextual meaning&lt;/em&gt; of styles when looking to reduce repetition, ignoring their &lt;em&gt;current values&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few generalities one can make:&lt;br /&gt;
* C is still very common in embedded development. Not C++, just plain C.&lt;br /&gt;
* assembler is only common in the very smallest CPUs, 8 bit microcontrollers and such, and used sparingly elsewhere. Programmers are simply more productive with more abstraction.&lt;br /&gt;
* Mobile phones are different than embedded devices, because they have a real user interface (GUI or text).  Java and C++ are common in phones. iPhone uses ObjectiveC, Windows Mobile has a CLR for subsets of the .Net languages.  &lt;/p&gt;
