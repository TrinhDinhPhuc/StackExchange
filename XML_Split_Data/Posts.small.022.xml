IE: I want to drag this vertical line (splitter bar) left and right (WEST and EAST).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the the system cursors (OCR_*), the only cursor that makes sense is the OCR_SIZEWE. Unfortunately, that is the big, awkward cursor the system uses when resizing a window. Instead, I am looking for the cursor that is about 20 pixels tall and around 3 or 4 pixel wide with two small arrows pointing left and right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can easily draw this and include it as a resource in my application but the cursor itself is so prevalent that I wanted to be sure it wasn't missing something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example: when you use the COM drag and drop mechanism (CLSID_DragDropHelper, IDropTarget, etc) you implicitly have access to the "drag" icon (little box under the pointer). I didn't see an explicit OCR_* constant for this guy ... so likewise, if I can't find this splitter cursor outright, I am wondering if it is part of a COM object or something else in the win32 lib.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to test the view, you could use a tool like &lt;a href="http://dbunit.sourceforge.net/"&gt;DBUnit&lt;/a&gt; to populate your feed and data tables with various data whose delta you've manually calculated.  Then, for each test  you would verify that the view returns a matching set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to test how your code responds to diffs detected by the view, I would try to abstract away database access.  I imagine an java method to which you can pass a result set (or list of POJO/DTO's) and returns a list of parameter Object arrays (again, or POJO's) to be added.  Other methods would parse the diff list for items to be removed and updated.  You could then create a mock result set or pojo's, pass them to your code and verify the correct parameters are returned.  All without touching a database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the key is to break your process into parts and test each of those as independently as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need a stronger algorithm, I'd recommend looking at blowfish which tends to be small and fast. It does still require memory for tables, but hopefully it will work for your application.&lt;/p&gt;

You can get his implementation in C (and other implementations as well) from &lt;A HREF="http://www.schneier.com/blowfish-download.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;his site&lt;/A&gt;.  This source does not carry a copyright notice. I suspect that the source code too is in the public domain, but a bit more checking may be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds like what you are trying to do should work just fine the way you have it, but there may be a problem with your SQL or elsewhere that is preventing the INSERT or UPDATE from working. Are you doing error checking for each database query as the perldoc suggests? Perhaps you can begin there or in your database error logs, watching the queries to see why they aren't being completed or if they ever arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing in MySQL to be wary of for &lt;code&gt;UPDATE&lt;/code&gt; statements: &lt;code&gt;mysqli_affected_rows()&lt;/code&gt; will return zero even if the &lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt; clause matched rows, but the &lt;code&gt;SET&lt;/code&gt; clause didn't actually change the data values. I only mention this because that behaviour caused a bug in a system I once looked at--the programmer used that return value to check for errors after an update, assuming a zero meant that some error had occurred. It just meant that the user didn't change any existing values before clicking the update button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I guess using &lt;code&gt;mysqli_affected_rows()&lt;/code&gt; can't be relied upon to find such warnings either, unless you have something like an &lt;code&gt;update_time&lt;/code&gt; column in your table that will always be assigned a new timestamp value when updated. That sort of workaround seems kinda kludgey though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;rant&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In C++, I never had to worry about this. The call to a class's destructor would be automatically inserted at the end of the object's scope. The only way to avoid that happening would be to use the new operator and hold the object behind a pointer, but that required extra work for the programmer isn't something they would do by accident, like forgetting to use using.
&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;/rant&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd like to explain why I'm not accepting the finalizer answers. Those answers are technically correct in themselves, but they are not C++ style destructors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the bug I found, reduced to the essentials...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;try
{
    PleaseDisposeMe a = new PleaseDisposeMe();
    throw new Exception();
    a.Dispose();
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Log(ex);
}

// This next call will throw a time-out exception unless the GC
// runs a.Dispose in time.
PleaseDisposeMe b = new PleaseDisposeMe();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using FXCop is an excellent suggestion, but if that's my only answer, my question would have to become a plea to the C# people, or use C++. Twenty nested using statements anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT (bold):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If will get called when the object is moved out of scope and is tidied by the garbage collector &lt;strong&gt;however this is not deterministic and is not guaranteed to happen at any particular time&lt;/strong&gt;.
This is called a Finalizer. All objects with a finaliser get put on a special finalise queue by the garbage collector where the finalise method is invoked on them (so it's technically a performance hit to declare empty finalisers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "accepted" dispose pattern as per the Framework Guidelines is as follows with unmanaged resources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; public class DisposableFinalisableClass : IDisposable
 {
  ~DisposableFinalisableClass()
  {
   Dispose(false);
  }

  public void Dispose()
  {
   Dispose(true);
  }

  protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
  {
   if (disposing)
   {
    // tidy managed resources
   }

   // tidy unmanaged resources
  }
 }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the above means that if someone calls Dispose the unmanaged resources are tidied. However in the case of someone forgetting to call Dispose or an exception preventing Dispose from being called the unmanaged resources will still be tidied away, only slightly later on when the GC gets its grubby mitts on it (which includes the application closing down or unexpectedly ending).&lt;/p&gt;

Java has a StringBuilder class which represents a non-thread-safe, mutable String.  When performing a bunch of String concatenations, the Java compiler silently converts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;String a = b + c + d;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;into&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;String a = new StringBuilder(b).append(c).append(d).toString();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which for large strings is significantly more efficient.  As far as I know, this does not happen when you use the concat method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the concat method is more efficient when concatenating an empty String onto an existing String.  In this case, the JVM does not need to create a new String object and can simply return the existing one.  See &lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#concat(java.lang.String)" rel="nofollow"&gt;the concat documentation&lt;/a&gt; to confirm this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you're super-concerned about efficiency then you should use the concat method when concatenating possibly-empty Strings, and use + otherwise.  However, the performance difference should be negligible and you probably shouldn't ever worry about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, there's a slight difference in semantics. If &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;a.concat(b)&lt;/code&gt; NPEs but &lt;code&gt;a+=b&lt;/code&gt; will treat the original value of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; as if it were &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;. Furthermore, the &lt;code&gt;concat()&lt;/code&gt; method only accepts &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; values while the &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; operator will silently convert the argument to a String (using the &lt;code&gt;toString()&lt;/code&gt; method for objects). So the &lt;code&gt;concat()&lt;/code&gt; method is more strict in what it accepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To look under the hood, write a simple class with a += b;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class Concat {
    String cat(String a, String b) {
        a += b;
        return a;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now disassemble with javap -c (included in the Sun JDK). You should see a listing including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;java.lang.String cat(java.lang.String, java.lang.String);
  Code:
   0:   new     #2; //class java/lang/StringBuilder
   3:   dup
   4:   invokespecial   #3; //Method java/lang/StringBuilder."&amp;lt;init&amp;gt;":()V
   7:   aload_1
   8:   invokevirtual   #4; //Method java/lang/StringBuilder.append:(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;
   11:  aload_2
   12:  invokevirtual   #4; //Method java/lang/StringBuilder.append:(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;
   15:  invokevirtual   #5; //Method java/lang/StringBuilder.toString:()Ljava/lang/    String;
   18:  astore_1
   19:  aload_1
   20:  areturn
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, a += b is the equivalent of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a = new StringBuilder()
    .append(a)
    .append(b)
    .toString();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;concat&lt;/code&gt; method should be faster. However, with more strings the &lt;code&gt;StringBuilder&lt;/code&gt; method wins, at least in terms of performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source code of &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;StringBuilder&lt;/code&gt; (and its package-private base class) is available in src.zip of the Sun JDK. You can see that you are building up a char array (resizing as necessary) and then throwing it away when you create the final &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;. In practice memory allocation is surprisingly fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When an installer asks whether to install for the current user or all users, it really only refers to shortcut placement (Start Menu; Desktop). The actual application files still go in the system-wide &lt;code&gt;%PROGRAMFILES%&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft's own ClickOnce works around this by creating a completely non-standard &lt;code&gt;%USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Apps&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming&lt;/code&gt; on Vista / Server 2008) directory, with both program files and configuration data in there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I'm at a loss why Microsoft couldn't add a per-user Program Files directory in Vista. For example, in OS X, you can create a &lt;code&gt;~/Applications&lt;/code&gt;, and the Finder will give it an appropriate icon. Apps like CrossOver and Adobe AIR automatically use that, defaulting to per-user apps. Thus, no permissions issues.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you probably &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; do: if the user is not an admin, install in the user directory; if they do, give them both options.&lt;/p&gt;

Amongst other sections (which I may post here as I get to them) I am writing a section on code formatting. So to start with, I think it is wise that, for whatever reason, we establish some basic, consistent code formatting/naming standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've looked at roughly 10 projects written over the last 3 years from this team and I'm,  obviously, finding a pretty wide range of styles. Contractors come in and out and at times, and sometimes even double the team size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am looking for a few suggestions for code formatting and naming standards that have really paid off ... but that can also really be justified. I think consistency and shared-patterns go a long way to making the code more maintainable ... but, are there other things I ought to consider when defining said standards?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you lineup parenthesis? Do you follow the same parenthesis guidelines when dealing with classes, methods, try catch blocks, switch statements, if else blocks, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you line up fields on a column? Do you notate/prefix private variables with an underscore? Do you follow any naming conventions to make it easier to find particulars in a file? How do you order the members of your class?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about suggestions for namespaces, packaging or source code folder/organization standards? I tend to start with something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;com|org|...&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;company&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;app&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;layer&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;function&amp;gt;.ClassName
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm curious to see if there are other, more accepted, practices than what I am accustomed to -- before I venture off dictating these standards. Links to standards already published online would be great too -- even though I've done a bit of that already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am using eclipse for some months now with m2eclipse integration. It's easy to use and straight forward. Once you associate your project to maven and update the dependencies using m2eclipse, any change to pom.xml are reflected to entire project, even Java version definition causes it to be compiled in right JRE (if you have it installed, and properly configured into eclipse.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another advantage I found is the maven plug-ins are easy to use integrated with eclipse (jetty being my best example, again, properly configured you can easily integrate maven, jetty-plug-in and Eclipse Debugger)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compilation, packaging and all other maven features are equally easy to use with a couple clicks or shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About q4e I have been reading a lot of good stuff about it and seems the next versions will do a lot more than m2eclipse, with a better dependency management and even visual graphs (!) but the general opinion is that m2eclipse is still better than q4e but q4e is getting better each new version and maybe will surpass m2eclipse soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each IDisposable class &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; have a finalizer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever using an IDisposable object, it must be used inside a "using" block. The only exception is if the object is a member of another class, in which case the containing class must be IDisposable and must call the member's 'Dispose' method in its own implementation of 'Dispose'. This means 'Dispose' should never be called by the developer except for inside another 'Dispose' method, eliminating the bug described in the question.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The code in each Finalizer must begin with a warning/error log notifying us that the finalizer has been called. This way you have an extremely good chance of spotting such bugs as described above before releasing the code, plus it might be a hint for bugs occuring in your system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make our lives easier, we also have a SafeDispose method in our infrastructure, which calls the the Dispose method of its argument within a try-catch block (with error logging), just in case (although Dispose methods are not supposed to throw exceptions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See also: &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/clyon/archive/2004/09/23/233464.aspx"&gt;Chris Lyon&lt;/a&gt;'s suggestions regarding IDisposable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit:
@&lt;a href="#47617"&gt;Quarrelsome&lt;/a&gt;: One thing you ought to do is call GC.SuppressFinalize inside 'Dispose', so that if the object was disposed, it wouldn't be "re-disposed".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also usually advisable to hold a flag indicating whether the object has already been disposed or not. The follwoing pattern is usually pretty good:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class MyDisposable: IDisposable {
    public void Dispose() {
        lock(this) {
            if (disposed) {
                return;
            }

            disposed = true;
        }

        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);

        // Do actual disposing here ...
    }

    private bool disposed = false;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, locking is not always necessary, but if you're not sure if your class would be used in a multi-threaded environment or not, it is advisable to keep it.&lt;/p&gt;

If you would like to add full-text searching, it would be prudent to investigate each a little bit and try them out to see how well it works for you in your environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MySQL has built-in support for full-text searching.  It has online support meaning that when new records are added to the database, they are automatically indexed and will be available in the search results. The &lt;a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/fulltext-search.html"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; has more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/acts-as-tsearch/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;acts_as_tsearch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; offers a wrapper for similar built-in functionality for recent versions of &lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/textsearch.html"&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For other databases you will have to use other software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://lucene.apache.org/"&gt;Lucene&lt;/a&gt; is a popular search provider written in Java. You can use Lucene through its search server &lt;a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/"&gt;Solr&lt;/a&gt; with Rails using &lt;a href="http://acts-as-solr.rubyforge.org/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;acts_as_solr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't want to use Java, there is a port of Lucene to Ruby called &lt;a href="http://ferret.davebalmain.com/trac/wiki"&gt;Ferret&lt;/a&gt;. Support for Rails is added using the &lt;a href="http://projects.jkraemer.net/acts%5Fas%5Fferret/wiki"&gt;&lt;code&gt;acts_as_ferret&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; plugin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://xapian.org/"&gt;Xapian&lt;/a&gt; is another good option and is supported in Rails using the &lt;a href="http://github.com/frabcus/acts%5Fas%5Fxapian/wikis"&gt;&lt;code&gt;acts_as_xapian&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; plugin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, my preferred choice is &lt;a href="http://www.sphinxsearch.com/"&gt;Sphinx&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href="http://blog.evanweaver.com/files/doc/fauna/ultrasphinx/files/README.html"&gt;Ultrasphinx&lt;/a&gt; plugin. It is extremely fast and has many options on how to index and search your databases, but is no longer being actively maintainged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another plugin for Sphinx is &lt;a href="http://ts.freelancing-gods.com/"&gt;Thinking Sphinx&lt;/a&gt; which has a lot of positive &lt;a href="http://www.williambharding.com/blog/rails/rails-thinking-sphinx-plugin-full-text-searching-thats-cooler-than-a-polar-bears-toenails/"&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt;. It is a little easier to get started using Thinking Sphinx than Ultrasphinx. I would suggest investigating both plugins to determine which fits better with your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A slightly better implementation, though this is all subjective to some degree, would be to create a server-side model (read: C# class(es)) that represents this dictionary (or simply use an instance of Dictionary&amp;lt;string, string&amp;gt;) and serialize that to JavaScript literal object notation. That way you are not dealing with the string hacking you see in Jon's example (if that bothers you).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;String a = new String("a") // more than 20 times slower than String a = "a"

&lt;p&gt;Why wasn't the compiler capable of optimize the string creation in "a + b" code, knowing the it always resulted in the same string? It could avoid a new string creation.

&lt;p&gt;First, the &lt;a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/NullPointerException.html"&gt;NPE JavaDoc&lt;/a&gt; explicitly lists the cases where NPE is appropriate.  Notice that all of them are thrown &lt;i&gt;by the runtime&lt;/i&gt; when &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; is used inappropriately.  In contrast, the &lt;a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/IllegalArgumentException.html"&gt;IAE JavaDoc&lt;/a&gt; couldn't be more clear: "Thrown to indicate that a method has been passed an illegal or inappropriate argument."  Yup, that's you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, when you see an NPE in a stack trace, what do you assume?  Probably that someone dereferenced a &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;.  When you see IAE, you assume the caller of the method at the top of the stack passed in an illegal value.  Again, the latter assumption is true, the former is misleading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, since IAE is clearly designed for validating parameters, you have to assume it as the default choice of exception, so why would you choose NPE instead?  Certainly not for different behavior -- do you really expect calling code to catch NPE's separately from IAE and do something different as a result?  Are you trying to communicate a more specific error message?  But you can do that in the exception message text anyway, as you should for all other incorrect parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, all other incorrect parameter data will be IAE, so why not be consistent?  Why is it that an illegal &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; is so special that it deserves a separate exception from all other types of illegal arguments?&lt;/p&gt;

It creates a temporary &lt;code&gt;StringBuilder&lt;/code&gt;, appends the parts, and finishes with &lt;code&gt;toString()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, all of the answers so far are ignoring the effects of HotSpot runtime optimizations.  Specifically, these temporary operations are recognized as a common pattern and are replaced with more efficient machine code at run-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@&lt;a href="#47694"&gt;marcio&lt;/a&gt;: You've created a &lt;a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp02225.html"&gt;micro-benchmark&lt;/a&gt;; with modern JVM's this is not a valid way to profile code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason run-time optimization matters is that many of these differences in code -- even including object-creation -- are completely different once HotSpot gets going.  The only way to know for sure is profiling your code &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, all of these methods are in fact incredibly fast.  This might be a case of premature optimization.  If you have code that concatenates strings a lot, the way to get maximum speed probably has nothing to do with which operators you choose and instead the algorithm you're using!&lt;/p&gt;

Wikipedia is really confusing about this, but basically the algorithm works like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say, you want to evaluate 1 + 2 * 3 + 4. Intuitively, you "know" you have to do the 2 * 3 first, but how do you get this result? The key is to realize that when you're scanning the string from left to right, you will evaluate an operator when the operator that &lt;strong&gt;follows&lt;/strong&gt; it has a lower (or equal to) precedence. In the context of the example, here's what you want to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at: 1 + 2, don't do anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now look at 1 + 2 * 3, still don't do anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now look at 1 + 2 * 3 + 4, now you know that 2 * 3 has to to be  evaluated because the next operator has lower precedence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you implement this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to have two stacks, one for numbers, and another for operators. You push numbers onto the stack all the time. You compare each new operator with the one at the top of the stack, if the one on top of the stack has higher priority, you pop it off the operator stack, pop the operands off the number stack, apply the operator and push the result onto the number stack. Now you repeat the comparison with the top of stack operator. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming back to the example, it works like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;N = [ ]
Ops = [ ]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read 1. N = [1], Ops = [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read +. N = [1], Ops = [+]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read 2. N = [1 2], Ops = [+]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;. N = [1 2], Ops = [+ *]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read 3. N = [1 2 3], Ops = [+ *]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read +. N = [1 2 3], Ops = [+ *]
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pop 3, 2 and execute 2&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;3, and push result onto N. N = [1 6], Ops = [+]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; is left associative, so you want to pop 1, 6 off as well and execute the +. N = [7], Ops = [].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally push the [+] onto the operator stack. N = [7], Ops = [+].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read 4. N = [7 4]. Ops = [+].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You're run out off input, so you want to empty the stacks now. Upon which you will get the result 11.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There, that's not so difficult, is it? And it makes no invocations to any grammars or parser generators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't want to over normalize your database because you will have too many tables and it will cause your queries of even simple objects take longer than they should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good rule of thumb I follow is to normalize the same information repeated over and over again.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example if you are creating a contact management application it would make sense to have Address (Street, City, State, Zip, etc. . ) as its own table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However if you have only 2 types of contacts, Business or personal, do you need a contact type table if you know you are only going to have 2?  For me no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would start by first figuring out the datatypes you need.  Use a modeling program to help like Visio.  You don't want to start with a non-normalized database because you will eventually normalize.  Start by putting objects in there logical groupings, as you see data repeated take that data into a new table.  I would keep up with that process until you feel you have the database designed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let testing tell you if you need to combine tables.  A well written query can cover any over normalization.&lt;/p&gt;

Many installers offer this option in their GUI, but the setting only affects where the shortcuts etc. go -- the binaries always fo to %ProgramFiles%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it is pretty hard to create Windows Installer packages that allow both kinds of installs, to say the least. With the advent of UAC, I'd say its is impossible: Per user installations must not require elevation, per machine installations have to. But whether an MSI package requires elevation is controlled via a bit in the summary information stream -- there is no way to have user input have impact on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether per-user or per-machine is the better choice greatly deoends on the application. For small packages, however, I tend to prefer per-user installations. Besides being slightly more user-friendly by not requiring an UAC prompt or runas, they also signalize the user that the setup will not do much harm to the computer (assuming he is a non-admin).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, you need a genuine personal success story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's how.  Grab some code from a core module, code that doesn't depend on external systems or too many other subroutines.  Doesn't matter how complex or simple the routine is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then start writing unit tests against it.  (I'm assuming you have an xUnit or similar for your language.)  Be really obnoxious with the tests -- test every boundary case, test max-int and min-int, test null's, test strings and lists with millions of elements, test strings with Korean and control characters and right-to-left Arabic and quotes and backslashes and periods and other things that tend to break things if not escaped.&lt;/p&gt;

But my experience is if you keep pushing forward you'll be amazed at the number of little problems.  Eventually it becomes hard to believe that &lt;i&gt;none&lt;/i&gt; of these bugs will &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; cause a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus you get a great feeling of accomplishment with something is done really, really well.  We know code is never perfect and rarely free of bugs, so it's nice when we've exhausted so many tests that we really do feel confident.  Confidence is a nice feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I think the last event that will trigger the love will happen weeks or months later.  Maybe you're fixing a bug or adding a feature or refactoring some code, and something you do will break a unit test.  "Huh?" you'll say, not understanding why the new change was even relevant to the broken test.  Then you'll find it, and find enlightenment.  Because you &lt;i&gt;really didn't know&lt;/i&gt; that you were breaking code, and the tests saved you.&lt;/p&gt;

When you use &lt;code&gt;Response.Redirect()&lt;/code&gt;, you send a response (to the browser that made the request) with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_302"&gt;HTTP Status Code 302&lt;/a&gt;, which tells the browser where to go next.  By definition, the browser will make that via a &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; request, even if the original request was a &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option is to use &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#3xx_Redirection"&gt;HTTP Status Code 307&lt;/a&gt;, which specifies that the browser should make the redirect request in the same way as the original request, but to prompt the user with a security warning.  To do that, you would write something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public void PageLoad(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Process the post on your side   

    Response.Status = "307 Temporary Redirect";
    Response.AddHeader("Location", "http://example.com/page/to/post.to");
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this won't always work.  &lt;a href="http://ilia.ws/archives/152-Cross-Domain-POST-Redirection.html"&gt;Different browsers implement this differently&lt;/a&gt;, since it is not a common status code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Alas, unlike the Opera and FireFox developers, the IE developers have never read the spec, and even the latest, most secure IE7 will redirect the POST request from domain A to domain B without any warnings or confirmation dialogs! Safari also acts in an interesting manner, while it does not raise a confirmation dialog and performs the redirect, it throws away the POST data, &lt;strong&gt;effectively changing 307 redirect into the more common 302.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as far as I know, the only way to implement something like this would be to use Javascript.  There are two options I can think of off the top of my head:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create the form and have it's &lt;code&gt;action&lt;/code&gt; attribute point to the third-party server.  Then, add a click event to the submit button that first executes an AJAX request to your server with the data, and then allows the form to be submitted to the third-party server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create the form to post to your server.  When the form is submitted, show the user a page that has a form in it with all of the data you want to pass on, all in hidden inputs.  Just show a message like "Redirecting...".  Then, add a javascript event to the page that submits the form to the third-party server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the two, I would choose the second, for two reasons.  First, it is more reliable than the first because Javascript is not required for it to work; for those who don't have it enabled, you can always make the submit button for the hidden form visible, and instruct them to press it if it takes more than 5 seconds.  Second, you can decide what data gets transmitted to the third-party server; if you use just process the form as it goes by, you will be passing along all of the post data, which is not always what you want.

My solution represents an older school javascript mentality (read, pre the emergence of ajax and json).  There are always better ways to solve a problem, which one of the reasons why stackoverflow is so cool.  Collectively we are better at the craft of programming than anyone of us on our own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on Jason's ideas I'd revise my initial code, and revise some of what Jason suggested.  Implement a C# class with two properties, the img resource "id" and a property that contains the WebResourceUrl.  Then, where I differ some from Jason is that rather than using a Dictionary I'd propose using a List, which you can then in turn serialize to JSON (using &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb412170.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;DataContractJsonSerializer&lt;/a&gt;), and emit the JSON as the dynamic script, rather than manually generating the javascript using a string buider.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why a List?  I think you may find that dictionaries when serialized to json, at least using the DataContractJsonSerializer (fyi available with the 3.5 framework only, with the 2.0 or 3.0 framework you'd need to bolt on aspnet ajax and use is json serializer), are a little more cumbersome to work with than how a list would serialize.  Although that is subjective. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are implications too with your client side code.  Now on the client side you'll have an array of the json serialized MyImageResourceClass instances.  You'd need to iterate through this array creating your "img" tags as you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully these ideas and suggestions can help get you going!  And no doubt there are other solutions.  I'm interested to see what comes of this.&lt;/p&gt;

Techniques differ depending on just how small the environment is.  But assuming you're talking about teeny processors and writing C code, here's what I've found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unit tests can run on the desktop, but be &lt;i&gt;sure&lt;/i&gt; you're using explicit integer types (e.g. &lt;code&gt;uint32_t&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sint8_t&lt;/code&gt;) and not &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt;.  These will be defined differently on the desktop than in the embedded environment, so algorithms that might e.g.  wrap when &lt;code&gt;sizeof(int) == 2&lt;/code&gt; but pass a unit test when &lt;code&gt;sizeof(int) == 4&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unit tests cannot be overlooked.  It's hard to use debuggers and loggers when you have real-time applications, so getting rid of little bugs is important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never allocate memory.  "Never" is extreme, but I've written code for 18 different embedded applications and never once had to use &lt;code&gt;malloc()&lt;/code&gt;.  No allocation means no memory leaks.  Every limit should be in a &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt; so you can change your mind, but you'll be surprised how often you don't need strings to be "any number" of characters in length.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple wins!  Simple algorithms, going complex only if a profiler or similar dictates that you must.  Simple architecture -- pointers and indirection and dynamic structures are extra slow in embedded environments.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profile.  The littlest things can have a big effect.  In one application we were getting only 12 k/s in a test where we transmitted a 1 MB file over the web server.  Eliminating some unnecessary &lt;code&gt;memcpy()&lt;/code&gt;s bought us 40 k/s, but then we discovered that the library implementation of &lt;code&gt;memcpy()&lt;/code&gt; was "dumb" with things like word-aligned moves.  After a little Internet research and a little assembly code, we sped up &lt;code&gt;memcpy()&lt;/code&gt; so much that the test now ran at 140 k/s!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Separation of concerns.  Modules and encapsulation are always useful to some extent, but for embedded environments it works even better.  You often know the complete set of ways and contexts that a piece of code will be used, so you really can test and document it thoroughly unlike with e.g. a Java class in a complex web-app with constantly changing requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test modes.  This can range from artificial tight loops where you do an operation as fast as possible or mock-inputs.  Test modes allow you to run code millions of times over a weekend.  This matters in embedded development because when you have to communicate with e.g. some microchip you can't test that with unit tests.  Sure there's the spec, but there's line noise and hidden bugs and incorrect voltages and all sorts of things that can't be captured in unit tests. You just have to burn it in.&lt;/li&gt;

'spot', 1 
'run', 1

&lt;li&gt;If fake classes can get the job done, go with them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you need an interface with multiple methods to be mocked, go with a mock framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoid using mocks &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; because they make tests brittle. Your tests now have intricate knowledge of the methods called by the implementation, if the mocked interface or your implementation changes... your tests break. This is bad coz you'll spend additional time getting your tests to run instead of just getting your SUT to run. &lt;em&gt;Tests should not be inappropriately intimate with the implementation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So use your best judgment.. I prefer mocks when it'll help save me writing-updating a fake class with n&gt;&gt;3 methods.&lt;/p&gt;

(Thanks to Toran Billups for example of a mockist test. See below)&lt;br /&gt;
Hi Doug, Well I think we've transcended into another holy war - Classic TDDers vs Mockist TDDers. I think I'm belong to the former.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I am on test#101 Test_ExportProductList and I find I need to add a new param to IProductService.GetProducts(). I do that get this test green. I use a refactoring tool to update all other references. Now I find all the mockist tests calling this member now blow up. Then I have to go back and update all these tests - a waste of time. Why did ShouldPopulateProductsListOnViewLoadWhenPostBackIsFalse fail? Was it because the code is broken? Rather the tests are broken. I favor the &lt;em&gt;one test failure = 1 place to fix&lt;/em&gt;. Mocking freq goes against that. Would stubs be better? If it I had a fake_class.GetProducts().. sure One place to change instead of shotgun surgery over multiple Expect calls. In the end it's a matter of style.. if you had a common utility method MockHelper.SetupExpectForGetProducts() - that'd also suffice.. but you'll see that this is uncommon. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you place a white strip on the test name, the test is hard to read. Lot of plumbing code for the mock framework hides the actual test being performed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;requires you to learn this particular flavor of a mocking framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If making a call to external code is part of your code's expected (outward-facing) behavior, this should be tested.  Use a mock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the call is really an implementation detail which the outside world doesn't care about, prefer stubs.  However:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're worried that later implementations of the tested code might accidentally go around your stubs, and you want to notice if that happens, use a mock.  You're coupling your test to your code, but it's for the sake of noticing that your stub is no longer sufficient and your test needs re-working.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second kind of mock is a sort of necessary evil.  Really what's going on here is that whether you use a stub or a mock, in some cases you have to couple to your code more than you'd like.  When that happens, it's better to use a mock than a stub only because you'll know when that coupling breaks and your code is no longer written the way your test thought it would be.  It's probably best to leave a comment in your test when you do this so that whoever breaks it knows that their code isn't wrong, the test is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And again, this is a code smell and a last resort.  If you find you need to do this often, try rethinking the way you write your tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM `entries` 
WHERE token like "%x%" union all

&lt;p&gt;The order clause should operate on the entire result set as one, which is what you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of performance it won't be all that fast (I'm guessing), however with databases the main overhead in terms of speed is often sending the query to the database engine from PHP and receiving the results. With this technique this only happens once instead of once per token, so performance will increase, I just don't know if it'll be enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note, if the link between client and server needs to be encrypted, then you'll need to "roll your own" encryption mechanism. The default &lt;code&gt;net.tcp&lt;/code&gt; encryption requires X.509 certificates, which won't work with streams as this kind of encryption needs to work on an entire message in one go rather than a stream of bytes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, in turn, means that you won't be able to authenticate the client using the default WCF security mechanisms as authentication requires encryption. The only work-around for this that I know of is to implement your own custom behaviour extensions on client and server to handle authentication. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A really good reference on how to add custom behaviour extensions is &lt;a href="http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/2006/10/02/CustomWCFBehaviorsThroughAppConfig.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;: this documents how to provide custom configuration, too (something that I don't think is discussed anywhere in the MSDN documents at this time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you have to really think about the size and complexity of individual embedded systems before coming to some conclusions about best practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's an interesting contrast, look at &lt;a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/138349" rel="nofollow"&gt;the system requirements for Windows 95&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare those requirements with a modern smart phone such as Nokia n95, that'll have 128MB RAM (iirc), a ROM size of about 90MB. This is considered an embedded evironment too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are large systems, anyone not considering a high level of automated testing in these environments is probably going to develop some pretty low quality products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here's my answer: there's really very few good practices which can't be translated from non-embedded systems to the embedded environment Admittedly there maybe some significant effort to create these environments which for 'simple' systems may not be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

Start with a CSS template file (maybe styles.css.template or something) containing something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a {
    color: ${colors.blue};
}

    a:hover {
        color: ${colors.blue.light};
    }

p {
    padding: ${padding.normal};
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then add a step to your build that assigns all the property values (I use external buildfiles and &amp;lt;include&amp;gt; them) and uses the &amp;lt;expandproperties&amp;gt; filter to generate the actual CSS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;property name="colors.blue" value="#0066FF" /&amp;gt;

mySelect.options.length = 0;
mySelect.options[0] = new Option ("Foo (only choice)", "Foo");
mySelect.options[0].selected="true";

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def gen():
    return (something for something in get_some_stuff())

&lt;p&gt;When you say HTML compressor I assume you mean a tool that removed whitespace etc from your pages to make them smaller, right? This doesn't impact how a crawler will see your html as it likely strips the same things from the HTML when it grabs the page from your site. The 'semantic' structure of the HTML exists whether compressed or not.&lt;/p&gt;

This increases the ratio of HTML tags to page content, or keyword density in SEO terms. It has bigger problems though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Longer page load times due to increased content to download, why not use the H1 tag?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's difficult for screenreaders to understand and affects site accessibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browsers may take longer to render the content depending on how they parse and layout pages with styles.&lt;/li&gt;

I created this to copy data from one auto-generated LINQ object to another in order to get around the lack of inheritance from multiple tables in LINQ.&lt;/p&gt;

To make fully automated tests might require the construction of a special test hardware rig, or the development of a simulator to recreate the embedded environment. In many cases this is impractical or unwarranted, perhaps requiring more development resources than the actual product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of a system that combines data processing with control and hardware, it is often helpful to separate the data processing into its own layer, so it can be recompiled for a PC platform where the full range of development tools and methods are available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important practice in embedded programming is to learn about the mechanisms, strengths and weaknesses of the embedded hardware. Know the size and number of registers, the instruction set features, arithmetic operators in particular. (For example, many embedded processors have no floating point unit or integer divide instruction.) Be aware of how best to write code so the compiler can generate efficient instructions. Learn the speed of various types of memory accesses. When designing algorithms, prefer simplicity wherever possible; often in embedded systems the number of elements to be processed is guaranteed to be small, and almost everything is fast for small N. Usually the best algorithm is one that requires minimum constant space and so allows you to avoid allocating memory. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I have to explicitly null the session
  value during non postbacks in order to
  emulate how ViewState works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm still foggy as to why you can't store whatever object(s) you are binding against in session. If you could store that object in session the following should work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On first load bind your top user control to the object during OnPreInit. Store the object in session. Viewstate will automatically be stored for those controls. If you have to bind the control the first time on Page_Load that is ok, but you'll end up having two events that call bind if you follow the next step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On postback, rebind your top user user control in the OnPreInit method against the object you stored in session. All of your controls should be recreated before the viewstate load. Then when viewstate is restored, the values will be set to whatever is in viewstate. The only caveat here is that when you bind again on the postback, you have to make 100% sure that the same number of controls are created again. The key to using Repeaters, Gridviews etc... with dynamic controls inside of them is that they &lt;strong&gt;have&lt;/strong&gt; to be rebound on every postback before the viewstate is loaded. OnPreInit is typically the best place to do this. There is no technical constraint in the framework that dictates that you must do all your work in Page_Load on the first load.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should work. However, if you can't use session for some reason, then you'll have to take a slightly different approach such as storing whatever you are binding against in the database after you bind your control, then pulling it out of the database and rebinding again on every postback.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I missing some obvious detail about your situation? I know it can be very tricky to explain the subtleties of the situation without posting code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I changed all references to OnInit to OnPreInit in this solution. I forgot that MS introduced this new event in ASP.NET 2.0. According to their &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178472.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;page lifecycle documentation&lt;/a&gt;, OnPreInit is where dynamic controls should be created/recreated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vehicle ECUs require in system testing, and the project I'm working on at the moment is building a HIL (Hardware in the Loop) tester, with continuous integration and testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several USB I/O devices connected to the ECU, and a debugger.  &lt;a href="http://www.mrmx.com/products/products_details/mxvdev" rel="nofollow"&gt;Software on the PC&lt;/a&gt; runs testing scripts which toggle real I/O, vary voltages and loads, and read inputs, take measurements, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm working on having a system pull the commits down, recompile, reprogram the target, and run all the tests.  The nature of the software requires a long test (lights remain on for so many seconds after the doors close, etc) so &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; continuous integration is unlikely, but a nightly test of all the latest commits is doable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would save vast amounts of time in debugging and hand testing - right now when a new baseline comes out everyone has to hand test their code.  Many don't, and it may be several baselines later before the error is found, and then it must be tracked down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is on a 16 bit processor, but the principles and application are the same across the gamut, the difference is that people don't want to spend a lot of time and money on this sort of solution when there's only one hardware guy and one software guy doing the majority of the work, and the projects are small enough that a test by hand of all the features takes minutes instead of hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, it offers great traceability to the customer.  Each test case has a list of requirements it tests.  At the end of a regression test the program generates reams of HTML reports with all the requirements that passed and failed, graphs of the I/O for that test over the period of the test, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

Yeah, automated testing is usually not worth this level of effort for very small, limited projects, but if the setup and cost were low (ie, most of it is setup time and cost) then everyone would want to use it on every project just as much as they use unit testing on PC targeted programs.&lt;/p&gt;

Nowadys you have things like the Native POSIX Thread Library - if you want.
But for a long time the only way to "delegate" the work in the unix world was to use fork() (and it's still prefered in many,many circumstances).
e.g. some kind of socket server
&lt;pre&gt;socket_accept()
fork()
if (child)
    handleRequest()
else

&lt;/pre&gt;Therefore the implementation of fork had to be fast and lots optimizations have been implemented over time.
Microsoft endorsed CreateThread or even fibers instead of creating new processes and usage of interprocess communication. I think it's not "fair" to compare CreateProcess to fork since they are not interchangeable. It's probably more appropriate to compare fork/exec to CreateProcess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes into a bit of detail about all of the ways the magic number reference is made.  Here's a quote about magic number as a bad programming practice &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The term magic number also refers to the bad programming practice of using numbers directly in source code without explanation. In most cases this makes programs harder to read, understand, and maintain. Although most guides make an exception for the numbers zero and one, it is a good idea to define all other numbers in code as named constants.&lt;/p&gt;

In programming, a magic number is an embedded numerical constant that appears without explanation. If it appears in two distinct locations, it can lead to circumstances where one instance is changed and not another. For both these reasons, it's important to isolate and define the numerical constants outside the places where they're used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, let's say you have a Page that displays the last 50 Orders in a "Your Orders" Overview Page. 50 is the Magic Number here, because it's not set through standard or convention, it's a number that you made up for reasons outlined in the spec.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what you do is you have the 50 in different places - your SQL script (&lt;code&gt;SELECT TOP 50 * FROM orders&lt;/code&gt;), your Website (Your Last 50 Orders), your order login (&lt;code&gt;for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; 50; i++)&lt;/code&gt;) and possibly many other places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what happens when someone decides to change 50 to 25? or 75? or 153? You now have to replace the 50 in all the places, and you are very likely to miss it. Find/Replace may not work, because 50 may be used for other things, and blindly replacing 50 with 25 can have some other bad side effects (i.e. your &lt;code&gt;Session.Timeout = 50&lt;/code&gt; call, which is also set to 25 and users start reporting too frequent timeouts).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the code can be hard to understand, i.e. "&lt;code&gt;if a &amp;lt; 50 then bla&lt;/code&gt;" - if you encounter that in the middle of a complicated function, other developers who are not familiar with the code may ask themselves "WTF is 50???"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why it's best to have such ambiguous and arbitrary numbers in exactly 1 place - "&lt;code&gt;const int NumOrdersToDisplay = 50&lt;/code&gt;", because that makes the code more readable ("&lt;code&gt;if a &amp;lt; NumOrdersToDisplay&lt;/code&gt;", it also means you only need to change it in 1 well defined place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Places where Magic Numbers are appropriate is everything that is defined through a standard, i.e. &lt;code&gt;SmtpClient.DefaultPort = 25&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;TCPPacketSize = whatever&lt;/code&gt; (not sure if that is standardized). Also, everything only defined within 1 function might be acceptable, but that depends on Context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first created an abstraction layer that allowed us to "slot in" any reasonable database connection (in our case, we simply supported a single ODBC-type connection).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this was in place, we were then able to do something like this in our code (we work in C++, but I'm sure you get the idea):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GetDatabase().ExecuteSQL( "INSERT INTO foo ( blah, blah )" )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At normal run time, GetDatabase() would return an object that fed all our sql (including queries), via ODBC directly to the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then started looking at in-memory databases - the best by a long way seems to be SQLite. (&lt;a href="http://www.sqlite.org/index.html"&gt;http://www.sqlite.org/index.html&lt;/a&gt;).  It's remarkably simple to set up and use, and allowed us subclass and override GetDatabase() to forward sql to an in-memory database that was created and destroyed for every test performed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're still in the early stages of this, but it's looking good so far, however we do have to make sure we create any tables that are required and populate them with test data - however we've reduced the workload somewhat here by creating a generic set of helper functions that can do a lot of all this for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it has helped immensely with our TDD process, since making what seems like quite innocuous changes to fix certain bugs can have quite strange affects on other (difficult to detect) areas of your system - due to the very nature of sql/databases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, our experiences have centred around a C++ development environment, however I'm sure you could perhaps get something similar working under PHP/Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;

You declare all the public defines, variables, and function prototypes that you want other programs to access in the header.  In your main project you'll #include  and that code can now access the functions and variables of the tea module that are mentioned in the header.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gets a little more complex after that.  If you're using Visual Studio and many other IDEs that manage your build for you, then ignore this part - they take care of compiling and linking objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Linker&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you compile two separate C files the compiler produces individual object files - so main.c becomes main.o, and tea.c becomes tea.o.  The linker's job is to look at all the object files (your main.o and tea.o), and match up the references - so when you call a tea function in main, the linker modifies that call so it actually does call the right function in tea.  The linker produces the executable file.&lt;/p&gt;

The usual case is that your code will generally be far too large to fit into one file. A good rule is that you should split the functionality into logical units (.c files) and each file should contain no more than what you can easily hold in your head at one time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A given software product then generally includes the output from many different .c files. How this is normally done is that the compiler produces a number of object files (in unix systems ".o" files, VC generates .obj files). It is the purpose of the "linker" to compose these object files into the output (either a shared library or executable).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally your implementation (.c) files contain actual executable code, while the header files (.h) have the declarations of the public functions in those implementation files. You can quite easily have more header files than there are implementation files, and sometimes header files can contain inline code as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is generally quite unusual for implementation files to include each other. A good practice is to ensure that each implementation file separates its concerns from the other files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would recommend you download and look at the source for the linux kernel. It is quite massive for a C program, but well organised into separate areas of functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

To my mind  it's not necessarily whether what you are doing is tied to the h/w or not it really depends on the complexity of the system being developed. I've worked on complex hardware integrations which involve 10-15 seperate device drivers, and multiple processors (ASSP/DSPs) involving complex power management schemes. On systems of this size it is definitely worth creating (or adapting if you're lucky) remote ROM image download and some sort of automated execution environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use emulation to validate the functionality of more h/w agnostic components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these systems there are also some best practices you should try to get your h/w designers to adopt, specifically provide h/w with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the fastest simplest external debug comms possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a power control mechanism which can be remotely/automatically controlled&lt;/li&gt;

Every .c file represents a module with a certain amount of functionality. If functions in a .c file are used by other modules (i.e. other .c files) put the function prototype in the .h interface file. By including the interface file in your original modules .c file and every other .c file you  need the function in, you make this function available to other modules. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you only need a function in a certain .c file (not in any other module), declare its scope static. This means it can only be called from within the c file it is defined in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same goes for variables that are used across multiple modules. They should go in the header file and there they have to marked with the keyword 'extern'. Note: For functions the keyword 'extern' is optional. Functions are always considered 'extern'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inclusion guards in header files help to not include the same header file multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Module1.c:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    #include "Module1.h"

    static void MyLocalFunction(void);
    static unsigned int MyLocalVariable;    

    void MyExternFunction(void)
    {
        MyLocalVariable = 1u;       

        /* Do something */

        MyLocalFunction();
    }

    static void MyLocalFunction(void)
    {
      /* Do something */

      MyExternVariable = 2u;
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Module1.h:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    #ifndef __MODULE1.H
    #define __MODULE1.H

    extern unsigned int MyExternVariable;

    void MyExternFunction(void)      

    #endif
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Module2.c&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    #include "Module.1.h"

    static void MyLocalFunction(void);

    static void MyLocalFunction(void)
    {
      MyExternVariable = 1u;
      MyExternFunction();
    }

We currently test all of the "business" logic with nunit and RhinoMocks including as part of a Cruise Control based continuous integration process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a C project that builds with WinAVR (and AVR Studio). This is partitioned into three logical components: The main driver, hardware compatibility layer and the common logic. The common logic or "business" logic is the bulk of the code and is designed to be tested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a C project in Visual Studio that includes the common component above and either a C++/CLI wrapper OR Win32 DLL. In the case of the C++/CLI wrapper, you get the managed component that can be tested with nunit. In the Win32 DLL -- you get something that can be P/Invoked from the tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The common code should expose a function(s) that accepts function pointers that implement the hardware specific layers (essentially a IOC/DI mechanism).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The native AVR driver (i.e., where main lives) initializes the common component to use the native hardware libraries (this includes things likes ports and other hardware specific things like "sleep").&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The nunit tests initialize the managed wrapper (C++/CLI or pinvokes to a DLL) with delegates that point to a managed implementation. This includes being able to use mocking tool like Rhino Mocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we get unit tests, dependency injection, mocking, continuous integration all for an 8 bit micro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integration tests might use something the Phidgets products to drive the hardware as a black box. Importantly, if the unit tests and partitioning are done right this becomes a relatively small part of the development effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automated building of projects becomes more necessary as the number of developers working on a project increase. It is very easy for two developers to write incompatible code which will break when it is combined (imagine I'm calling a function foo(int x), and you change the signature to be foo(int x, int y): when we combine our code bases, the code will break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The compiler is not primarily concerned with header files. Each invocation of the compiler compiles a source (.c) file into an object (.o) file. Behind the scenes (i.e. in the &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; file or project file) a command line equivalent to this is being generated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;compiler --options tea.c

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Eggs are to Pythons as Jars are to Java..."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Python eggs are a way of bundling
  additional information with a Python
  project, that allows the project's
  dependencies to be checked and
  satisfied at runtime, as well as
  allowing projects to provide plugins
  for other projects. There are several
  binary formats that embody eggs, but
  the most common is '.egg' zipfile
  format, because it's a convenient one
  for distributing projects. All of the
  formats support including
  package-specific data, project-wide
  metadata, C extensions, and Python
  code.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The primary benefits of Python Eggs
  are:&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They enable tools like the "Easy Install" Python package manager&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;.egg files are a "zero installation" format for a Python
  package; no build or install step is
  required, just put them on PYTHONPATH
  or sys.path and use them (may require
  the runtime installed if C extensions
  or data files are used)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can include package metadata, such as the other eggs they depend on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They allow "namespace packages" (packages that just contain other
  packages) to be split into separate
  distributions (e.g. zope.&lt;em&gt;, twisted.&lt;/em&gt;,
  peak.* packages can be distributed as
  separate eggs, unlike normal packages
  which must always be placed under the
  same parent directory. This allows
  what are now huge monolithic packages
  to be distributed as separate
  components.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They allow applications or libraries to specify the needed
  version of a library, so that you can
  e.g. require("Twisted-Internet&gt;=2.0")
  before doing an import
  twisted.internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They're a great format for distributing extensions or plugins to
  extensible applications and frameworks
  (such as Trac, which uses eggs for
  plugins as of 0.9b1), because the egg
  runtime provides simple APIs to locate
  eggs and find their advertised entry
  points (similar to Eclipse's
  "extension point" concept).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also other benefits that may come from having a standardized
  format, similar to the benefits of
  Java's "jar" format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Load database from SQL 2000 backup&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Set compatibility mode to SQL 2005&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;USE mydb
GO

ALTER DATABASE mydb SET COMPATIBILITY_LEVEL = 90
GO
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

  FROM sys.master_files mf 
 WHERE type = 4 
   AND EXISTS( SELECT * 
                 FROM sys.databases db

                  AND name           = 'mydb')
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Then for each name (I did this in a little script)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ALTER DATABASE mydb 
MODIFY FILE( NAME = {full text catalog name}, FILENAME="N:\ew\path\to\wherever")

You can look at the system's .h files under /usr/include if you're interested in the normal idioms involved with these files.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some code might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

Windows (and DOS before that) have originally been single-user systems for &lt;em&gt;personal&lt;/em&gt; computers. As such, these systems typically don't have to create a lot of processes all the time; (very) simply put, a process is only created when this one lonely user requests it (and we humans don't operate very fast, relatively speaking).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unix-based systems have originally been multi-user systems and servers. Especially for the latter it is not uncommon to have processes (e.g. mail or http daemons) that split off processes to handle specific jobs (e.g. taking care of one incoming connection). An important factor in doing this is the cheap &lt;code&gt;fork&lt;/code&gt; method (that, as mentioned by Rob Walker (&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/47845/why-is-creating-a-new-process-more-expensive-on-windows-than-linux#47865"&gt;47865&lt;/a&gt;), initially uses the same memory for the newly created process) which is very useful as the new process immediately has all the information it needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that at least historically the need for Unix-based systems to have fast process creation is far greater than for Windows systems. I think this is still the case because Unix-based systems are still very process oriented, while Windows, due to its history, has probably been more thread oriented (threads being useful to make responsive applications).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;XSS flaws occur whenever an application takes user supplied data and sends it to a web browser without first validating or encoding that content. XSS allows attackers to execute script in the victim's browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, possibly introduce worms, etc.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Injection flaws, particularly SQL injection, are common in web applications. Injection occurs when user-supplied data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker's hostile data tricks the interpreter into executing unintended commands or changing data.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A CSRF attack forces a logged-on victim's browser to send a pre-authenticated request to a vulnerable web application, which then forces the victim's browser to perform a hostile action to the benefit of the attacker. CSRF can be as powerful as the web application that it attacks.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Applications can unintentionally leak information about their configuration, internal workings, or violate privacy through a variety of application problems. Attackers use this weakness to steal sensitive data, or conduct more serious attacks.&lt;/li&gt;

When you call a method on a stub that returns a value, it typically just gives you back a value.  But when you call a method on a mock, not only does it return a value, it also enforces the expectation that you set up that the method was even called in the first place.  In other words, if you set up an expectation and then don't call that method, an exception gets thrown.  When you set an expectation, you are essentially saying "If this method doesn't get called, something went wrong."  And the opposite is true, if you call a method on a mock and did not set an expectation, it will throw an exception, essentially saying "Hey, what are you doing calling this method when you didn't expect it."  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you don't want expectations on every method you're calling, so some mocking frameworks will allow "partial" mocks that are like mock/stub hybrids, in that only the expectations you set are enforced, and every other method call is treated more like a stub in that it just returns a value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One valid place to use stubs I can think of off the top, though, is when you are introducing testing into legacy code.  Sometimes it's just easier to make a stub by subclassing the class you are testing than refactoring everything to make mocking easy or even possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to this...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Avoid using mocks always because they make tests brittle. Your tests now have intricate knowledge of the methods called by the implementation, if the mocked interface changes... your tests break. So use your best judgment..&amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...I say if my interface changes, my tests had better break.  Because the whole point of unit tests is that they accurately test my code as it exists right now.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Bigger C++ projects I've seen hardly used more than one namespace (e.g. boost library).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually boost uses tons of namespaces, typically every part of boost has its own namespace for the inner workings and then may put only the public interface in the top-level namespace boost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I think that the larger a code-base becomes, the more important namespaces become, even within a single application (or library). At work we put each module of our application in its own namespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another use (no pun intended) of namespaces that I use a lot is the anonymous namespace:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;namespace {
  const int CONSTANT = 42;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is basically the same as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;static const int CONSTANT = 42;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using an anonymous namespace (instead of static) is however the recommended way for code and data to be visible only within the current compilation unit in C++.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting the &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;th bit to either &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; can be achieved with the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good motivation to Monads is sigfpe(Dan Piponi)'s &lt;a href="http://sigfpe.blogspot.com/2006/08/you-could-have-invented-monads-and.html"&gt;You Could Have Invented Monads! (And Maybe You Already Have)&lt;/a&gt;. There are &lt;a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Monad_tutorials_timeline"&gt;a LOT of other monad tutorials&lt;/a&gt;, many of which misguidedly try to explain monads in "simple terms" using various analogies: this is the &lt;a href="http://byorgey.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/abstraction-intuition-and-the-monad-tutorial-fallacy/"&gt;monad tutorial fallacy&lt;/a&gt;; avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As DR MacIver says in &lt;a href="http://www.drmaciver.com/2008/02/tell-us-why-your-language-sucks/"&gt;Tell us why your language sucks&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;So, things I hate about Haskell:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Lets start with the obvious. Monad tutorials. No, not monads. Specifically the tutorials. Theyre endless, overblown and dear god are they tedious. Further, Ive never seen any convincing evidence that they actually help. Read the class definition, write some code, get over the scary name. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You say you understand the Maybe monad? Good, you're on your way. Just start using other monads and sooner or later you'll understand what monads are in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[If you are mathematically oriented, you might want to ignore the dozens of tutorials and learn the definition, or follow &lt;a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2455"&gt;lectures in category theory&lt;/a&gt; :)
The main part of the definition is that a Monad M involves a "type constructor" that defines for each existing type "T" a new type "M T", and some ways for going back and forth between "regular" types and "M" types.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, surprisingly enough, one of the best introductions to monads is actually one of the early academic papers introducing monads, Philip Wadler's &lt;a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/marktoberdorf/baastad.pdf"&gt;Monads for functional programming&lt;/a&gt;. It actually has practical, &lt;em&gt;non-trivial&lt;/em&gt; motivating examples, unlike many of the artificial tutorials out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three or four years back there was a bit of conventional wisdom floating around that the search engine algorithms would give more weight to search terms that happened sooner in the page.  If all other things were equal on Pages A and B, if Page A mentions widgets earlier in the HTML file than Page B, Page A "wins". It's not that Google's engineers and PhD employees couldn't skip over the  blocks, it's that they found a valuable metric in their presence. Taking that into account, it's easy to see how unless something "needs" (see #2 below) to be in the head of a document, an SEO obsessed person would want it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEO people who aren't offering a quick fix tend to be proponents of well-crafted, validating/conforming HTML/XHTML structure.  Inline Javascript, particularly the kind web ignorant software engineers tend to favor makes these people (I'm one) seethe. The bias against script tags themselves could also stem from some of the work Yahoo and others have done in optimizing Ajax applications (don't make the browser parse Javascript until is has to).  Not necessarily directly related to SEO, but a best practice a white hat SEO type will have picked up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also possible you're misunderstanding each other.  &lt;strong&gt;Content&lt;/strong&gt; that's generated by Javascript is considered controversial in the SEO world. It's not that Google can't "see" this content, it's that people are unsure how its presence will rank the page, as a lot of black hat SEO games revolve around hiding and showing content with Javascript.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEO is at best Kremlinology and at worse a field that the black hats won over a long time ago.  My free unsolicited advice is to stay out of the SEO game, present your managers with estimates as so how long it will take to implement their SEO related changes, and leave it at that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Simple Superclass Name&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"[...] The names should be short and punchy.
  However, to make the names precise
  sometimes seems to require several
  words. A way out of this dilemma is
  picking a strong metaphor for the
  computation. With a metaphor in mind,
  even single words bring with them a
  rich web of associations, connections,
  and implications. For example, in the
  HotDraw drawing framework, my first
  name for an object in a drawing was
  &lt;strong&gt;DrawingObject&lt;/strong&gt;. Ward Cunningham came
  along with the typography metaphor: a
  drawing is like a printed, laid-out
  page. Graphical items on a page are
  figures, so the class became &lt;strong&gt;Figure&lt;/strong&gt;.
  In the context of the metaphor, &lt;strong&gt;Figure&lt;/strong&gt;
  is simultaneously shorter, richer, and
  more precise than &lt;strong&gt;DrawingObject&lt;/strong&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Qualified Subclass Name&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"The names of subclasses have two jobs.
  They need to communicate what class
  they are like and how they are
  different. [...] Unlike the names at
  the roots of hierarchies, subclass
  names arent used nearly as often in
  conversation, so they can be
  expressive at the cost of being
  concise. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Give subclasses that serve as the
  roots of hierarchies their own simple
  names. For example, &lt;em&gt;HotDraw&lt;/em&gt; has a
  class &lt;strong&gt;Handle&lt;/strong&gt; which presents figure-
  editing operations when a figure is
  selected. It is called, simply, &lt;strong&gt;Handle&lt;/strong&gt;
  in spite of extending &lt;strong&gt;Figure&lt;/strong&gt;. There is
  a whole family of handles and they
  most appropriately have names like
  &lt;strong&gt;StretchyHandle&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;TransparencyHandle&lt;/strong&gt;.
  Because &lt;strong&gt;Handle&lt;/strong&gt; is the root of its own
  hierarchy, it deserves a simple
  superclass name more than a qualified
  subclass name. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Another wrinkle in
  subclass naming is multiple-level
  hierarchies. [...] Rather than blindly
  prepend the modifiers to the immediate
  superclass, think about the name from
  the readers perspective. What class
  does he need to know this class is
  like? Use that superclass as the basis
  for the subclass name."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Interface&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Two styles of naming interfaces depend on how you are thinking of the interfaces. 
  Interfaces as classes without implementations should be named as if they were classes 
  (&lt;em&gt;Simple Superclass Name&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Qualified Subclass Name&lt;/em&gt;). One problem with this style of 
  naming is that the good names are used up before you get to naming classes. An 
  interface called &lt;strong&gt;File&lt;/strong&gt; needs an implementation class called something like 
  &lt;strong&gt;ActualFile&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;ConcreteFile&lt;/strong&gt;, or (yuck!) &lt;strong&gt;FileImpl&lt;/strong&gt; (both a suffix and an 
  abbreviation). In general, communicating whether one is dealing with a concrete or 
  abstract object is important, whether the abstract object is implemented as an 
  interface or a superclass is less important. Deferring the distinction between 
  interfaces and superclasses is well &gt;supported by this style of naming, leaving you 
  free to change your mind later if that &gt;becomes necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, naming concrete classes simply is more important to communication than 
  hiding the use of interfaces. In this case, prefix interface names with I. If the 
  interface is called &lt;strong&gt;IFile&lt;/strong&gt;, the class can be simply called &lt;strong&gt;File&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not that static typing is more productive than duck typing as much as it is simply different. With duck typing you always have to worry that your data has the right method and in Javascript or Ruby it shows up through a lot of method testing. With static typing it doesn't matter as long as it is the correct interface, so it really just eliminates a lot of the hassle of testing and conversions between types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are important because they are considered by the compiler to apply the interface principle. Basically, it can be explained by an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;namespace ns {

class A
{
};

void print(A a)
{
}

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wanted to print an A object, the code would be this one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ns::A a;
print(a);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that we didn't explicitly mention the namespace when calling the function. This is the interface principle: C++ consider a function taking a type as an argument as being part of the interface for that type, so no need to specify the namespace because the parameter already implied the namespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now why this principle is important? Imagine that the class A author did not provide a print() function for this class. You will have to provide one yourself. As you are a good programmer, you will define this function in your own namespace, or maybe in the global namespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;namespace ns {

class A
{
};

}

void print(A a)
{
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And your code can start calling the print(a) function wherever you want. Now imagine that years later, the author decides to provide a print() function, better than yours because he knows the internals of his class and can make a better version than yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then C++ authors decided that his version of the print() function should be used instead of the one provided in another namespace, to respect the interface principle. And that this "upgrade" of the print() function should be as easy as possible, which means that you won't have to change every call to the print() function. That's why "interface functions" (function in the same namespace as a class) can be called without specifying the namespace in C++.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's why you should consider a C++ namespace as an "interface" when you use one and keep in mind the interface principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want better explanation of this behavior, you can refer to the book &lt;a href="http://books.google.fr/books?id=mT7E5gDuW_4C&amp;amp;dq=exceptional+C%2B%2B&amp;amp;pg=PP1&amp;amp;ots=AXUPz0dWnW&amp;amp;sig=DAib0u-zXuY3lGCCUFPtzI33pCQ&amp;amp;hl=fr&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;resnum=1&amp;amp;ct=result#PPA119,M1"&gt;Exceptional C++ from Herb Sutter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Stick with Vim.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In computer programming, a branch
  table (sometimes known as a jump
  table) is a term used to describe an
  efficient method of transferring
  program control (branching) to another
  part of a program (or a different
  program that may have been dynamically
  loaded) using a table of branch
  instructions. The branch table
  construction is commonly used when
  programming in assembly language but
  may also be generated by a compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;A branch table consists of a serial
  list of unconditional branch
  instructions that is branched into
  using an offset created by multiplying
  a sequential index by the instruction
  length (the number of bytes in memory
  occupied by each branch instruction).
  It makes use of the fact that machine
  code instructions for branching have a
  fixed length and can be executed
  extremely efficiently by most
  hardware, and is most useful when
  dealing with raw data values that may
  be easily converted to sequential
  index values. Given such data, a
  branch table can be extremely
  efficient; it usually consists of the
  following steps: optionally validating
  the input data to ensure it is
  acceptable; transforming the data into
  an offset into the branch table, this
  usually involves multiplying or
  shifting it to take into account the
  instruction length; and branching to
  an address made up of the base of the
  table and the generated offset: this
  often involves an addition of the
  offset onto the program counter
  register.&lt;/p&gt;

As an example, a C switch statement is often implemented as a jump table where each jump entry will go to a particular "case" label.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In embedded systems, where memory usage is at a premium, many constructs are better served by using a jump table instead of more memory-intensive methods (like a massive if-else-if).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as a function executes, on finishing it jumps back to it's previous memory location or jumps to the next function, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And If your talking about what I think you are, you don't just need them in embedded systems but in any type of compiled/interpreted environment. &lt;/p&gt;

If you have a relatively static set of functions (such as system calls or virtual functions for a class) then you can create this table once and call the functions using a simple index into the array.  This would mean retrieving the pointer and calling a function or jumping to the machine code depending on the type of table used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits of doing this in embedded programming are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indexes are more memory efficient than machine code or pointers, so there is a potential for memory savings in constrained environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For any particular function the index will remain stable and changing the function merely requires swapping out the function pointer.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;MyJump(int c)

&lt;p&gt;Note that there's no return - the code that it jumps to will execute the return, and it will jump back to wherever myjump was called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is useful for state machines where you execute certain code based on the state variable.  There are many, many other uses, but this is one of the main uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's used where you don't want to waste time fiddling with the stack, and want to save code space.  It is especially of use in interrupt handlers where speed is extremely important, and the peripheral that caused the interrupt is only known by a single variable.  This is similar to the vector table in processors with interrupt controllers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One use would be taking a $0.60 microcontroller and generating a composite (TV) signal for video applications.  the micro isn't powerful - in fact it's just barely fast enough to write each scan line.  A jump table would be used to draw characters, because it would take too long to load a bitmap from memory, and use a for() loop to shove the bitmap out.  Instead there's a separate jump to the letter and scan line, and then 8 or so instructions that actually write the data directly to the port.&lt;/p&gt;

For background, I'm also a long-time vim user, but I learned emacs about 2 years ago, and now use them interchangeably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What drove me to the point of actually learning emacs was its useful ability to have a large number of files open at once, and to easily switch between them.  I was in the middle of introducing a feature that added and touched a large number of classes.  (This was C++, so there were typically two files per class.)  Since I was still firming up the interface, I would typically be in the middle of updating one file when I would realize that I needed to change another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With gvim, it was easiest to open a new window for each file, which was starting to get unwieldy.  With Emacs, though, it was simple to open a new file in the same window (Ctrl-x, Ctrl-f).  Once Emacs has a file open, it's very easy to switch back and forth between the open buffers (Ctrl-x, Ctrl-b).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking that one step further, a single emacs session may open many windows, so in addition to splitting the window vertically, I could decide, without interrupting work on a file, to open another next to it, letting me effectively work side-by-side while still keeping each window at the default 80-character width.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still some things that I find easier in vim (e.g. block-select mode, simple macro recording, diff mode), and things that are easier in Emacs (line alignment, file/buffer management, window/screen management).  Therefore, I find myself alternating between the two (and sometimes using both simultaneously), depending the editing task I anticipate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're still unsure, I'd suggest trying it out.  Run through the Emacs tutorial and then use it to write code for a morning or a day, leaning heavily on the help.  If you still don't like what you see, stay with vim.  Regardless of what the editor brings to the table, your familiarity and knowledge of the tool will by far be the most important factor in your productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You often see magic numbers embedded in file formats, because files can be sent around rather promiscuously and lose any metadata about how they were created. However magic numbers are also sometimes used for in-memory data structures, like ioctl() calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use this convention all over the place in some of the core classes of our internal framework to make the URL to controller mappings work.

Anyway, the point of my answer is that it seems well worth what is probably a slight performance decrease if it makes more flexible, dynamic code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;It's only equivalent if the modulus is always positive. The C and C++ standards don't specify the sign of the modulus when the first number is negative (until C++11, which &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; guarantee it will be negative, which is what most compilers were already doing). A bit-wise and gets rid of the sign bit, so it will always be positive (i.e. it's a true modulus, not a remainder). It sounds like that's what you want anyway though.&lt;/li&gt;

Simple queries may be easier with hql, while using the specification pattern you may find the Criteria API to be a better fit.  That stuff just stays encapsulated in your repository, and if your tests pass it doesn't much matter how you implement.&lt;/p&gt;

A side effect of many division routines is the modulus - so in few cases should division actually be faster than modulus.  I'm interested to see the source you got this information from.  Processors with multipliers have interesting division routines using the multiplier, but you can get from division result to modulus with just another two steps (multiply and subtract) so it's still comparable.  If the processor has a built in division routine you'll likely see it also provides the remainder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, there is a small branch of number theory devoted to &lt;a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics/Modular_arithmetic"&gt;Modular Arithmetic&lt;/a&gt; which requires study if you really want to understand how to optimize a modulus operation.  Modular arithmatic, for instance, is very handy for generating &lt;a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~carlson/mathcircles/magic.pdf"&gt;magic squares&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in that vein, here's a &lt;a href="http://piclist.org/techref/postbot.asp?by=time&amp;amp;id=piclist/2006/08/03/065022a"&gt;very low level look&lt;/a&gt; at the math of modulus for an example of x, which should show you how simple it can be compared to division:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe a better way to think about the problem is in terms of number
bases and modulo arithmetic. For example, your goal is to compute DOW
mod 7 where DOW is the 16-bit representation of the day of the
week. You can write this as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; DOW = DOW_HI*256 + DOW_LO

 DOW%7 = (DOW_HI*256 + DOW_LO) % 7
       = ((DOW_HI*256)%7  + (DOW_LO % 7)) %7
       = ((DOW_HI%7 * 256%7)  + (DOW_LO%7)) %7
       = ((DOW_HI%7 * 4)  + (DOW_LO%7)) %7
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expressed in this manner, you can separately compute the modulo 7
result for the high and low bytes. Multiply the result for the high by
4 and add it to the low and then finally compute result modulo 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computing the mod 7 result of an 8-bit number can be performed in a
similar fashion. You can write an 8-bit number in octal like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  X = a*64 + b*8 + c
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where a, b, and c are 3-bit numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  X%7 = ((a%7)*(64%7) + (b%7)*(8%7) + c%7) % 7
      = (a%7 + b%7 + c%7) % 7
      = (a + b + c) % 7
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;since &lt;code&gt;64%7 = 8%7 = 1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, a, b, and c are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  c = X &amp;amp; 7
  b = (X&amp;gt;&amp;gt;3) &amp;amp; 7
  a = (X&amp;gt;&amp;gt;6) &amp;amp; 7  // (actually, a is only 2-bits).
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest possible value for &lt;code&gt;a+b+c&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;7+7+3 = 17&lt;/code&gt;. So, you'll need
one more octal step. The complete (untested) C version could be
written like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;unsigned char Mod7Byte(unsigned char X)
{
    X = (X&amp;amp;7) + ((X&amp;gt;&amp;gt;3)&amp;amp;7) + (X&amp;gt;&amp;gt;6);
    X = (X&amp;amp;7) + (X&amp;gt;&amp;gt;3);

    return X==7 ? 0 : X;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a few moments writing a PIC version. The actual implementation
is slightly different than described above&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mod7Byte:
       movwf        temp1        ;
       andlw        7        ;W=c
       movwf        temp2        ;temp2=c
       rlncf   temp1,F        ;
       swapf        temp1,W ;W= a*8+b
       andlw   0x1F
       addwf        temp2,W ;W= a*8+b+c
       movwf        temp2   ;temp2 is now a 6-bit number
       andlw   0x38    ;get the high 3 bits == a'
       xorwf        temp2,F ;temp2 now has the 3 low bits == b'
       rlncf   WREG,F  ;shift the high bits right 4
       swapf   WREG,F  ;
       addwf        temp2,W ;W = a' + b'

 ; at this point, W is between 0 and 10


       addlw        -7
       bc      Mod7Byte_L2
Mod7Byte_L1:
       addlw        7
Mod7Byte_L2:
       return
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a liitle routine to test the algorithm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;       clrf    x
       clrf    count

TestLoop:
       movf        x,W
       RCALL   Mod7Byte
       cpfseq count
        bra    fail

       incf        count,W
       xorlw   7
       skpz
        xorlw        7
       movwf   count

       incfsz        x,F
       bra        TestLoop
passed:
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, for the 16-bit result (which I have not tested), you could
write:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;uint16 Mod7Word(uint16 X)
{
 return Mod7Byte(Mod7Byte(X &amp;amp; 0xff) + Mod7Byte(X&amp;gt;&amp;gt;8)*4);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, here are some easy-to-implement, correct-if-you-have-a-truly-random-number generator:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(0) Kyle's answer, which is O(n).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Generate a list of n pairs [(0, rand), (1, rand), (2, rand), ...], sort them by the second coordinate, and use the first k (for you, k=5) indices to get your random subset.  I think this is easy to implement, although it is O(n log n) time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Init an empty list s = [] that will grow to be the indices of k random elements.  Choose a number r in {0, 1, 2, ..., n-1} at random, r = rand % n, and add this to s.  Next take r = rand % (n-1) and stick in s; add to r the # elements less than it in s to avoid collisions.  Next take r = rand % (n-2), and do the same thing, etc. until you have k distinct elements in s.  This has worst-case running time O(k^2).  So for k &amp;lt;&amp;lt; n, this can be faster.  If you keep s sorted and track which contiguous intervals it has, you can implement it in O(k log k), but it's more work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@&lt;a href="#48129"&gt;Kyle &lt;/a&gt;- you're right, on second thought I agree with your answer.  I hastily read it at first, and mistakenly thought you were indicating to sequentially choose each element with fixed probability k/n, which would have been wrong - but your adaptive approach appears correct to me.  Sorry about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, and now for the kicker: asymptotically (for fixed k, n growing), there are n^k/k! choices of k element subset out of n elements [this is an approximation of (n choose k)].  If n is large, and k is not very small, then these numbers are huge.  The best cycle length you can hope for in any standard 32 bit random number generator is 2^32 = 256^4.  So if we have a list of 1000 elements, and we want to choose 5 at random, there's no way a standard random number generator will hit all the possibilities.  However, as long as you're ok with a choice that works fine for smaller sets, and always "looks" random, then these algorithms should be ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addendum&lt;/strong&gt;: After writing this, I realized that it's tricky to implement idea (2) correctly, so I wanted to clarify this answer.  To get O(k log k) time, you need an array-like structure that supports O(log m) searches and inserts - a balanced binary tree can do this.  Using such a structure to build up an array called s, here is some pseudopython:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Returns a container s with k distinct random numbers from {0, 1, ..., n-1}
def ChooseRandomSubset(n, k):
  for i in range(k):
    r = UniformRandom(0, n-i)                 # May be 0, must be &amp;lt; n-i
    q = s.FirstIndexSuchThat( s[q] - q &amp;gt; r )  # This is the search.
    s.InsertInOrder(q ? r + q : r + len(s))   # Inserts right before q.
  return s
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest running through a few sample cases to see how this efficiently implements the above English explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just completed a standards document for a team of 10-12 that work mostly in perl. The document says to use "perltidy-like indentation for complex data structures." We also provided everyone with example perltidy settings that would clean up their code to meet this standard. It was very clear and very much industry-standard for the language so we had great buyoff on it by the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When setting out to write this document, I asked around for some examples of great code in our repository and googled a bit to find other standards documents that smarter architects than I to construct a template. It was tough being concise and pragmatic without crossing into micro-manager territory but very much worth it; having &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; standard is indeed key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope it works out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always used braces in control structures, and place them on separate lines.  This eliminates problems with people adding code and including it or not including it mistakenly inside a control structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if(...)

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All switches/selects have a default case.  The default case logs an error if it's not a valid path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the same reason as above, any if...elseif... control structures MUST end with a default else that also logs an error if it's not a valid path.  A single if statement does not require this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the occasional case where a loop or control structure is intentionally empty, a semicolon is always placed within to indicate that this is intentional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;while(stillwaiting())
{
   ;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naming standards have very different styles for typedefs, defined constants, module global variables, etc.  Variable names include type. You can look at the name and have a good idea of what module it pertains to, its scope, and type.  This makes it easy to detect errors related to types, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are others, but these are the top off my head.&lt;/p&gt;

SessionState is accessed a lot less often as the viewstate.  I would keep the two separate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the ultimate solution would be storing the ViewState on the client some how and maybe worth looking at.  With &lt;a href="http://gears.google.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Google Gears&lt;/a&gt;, this could be possible now.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm looking for a way to monitor individual CPU core usage on these servers.  It is possible for an end-user to have a run-away process (e.g.  Internet Explorer or Outlook).  The core for that process may spike to near 100% leaving the other cores 'normal'.  Thus, the overall CPU usage on the server is just the total of all the cores or if 7 of the cores on a 8 core server are idle and the 8th is running at 100% then 1/8 = 12.5% usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What utility can I use to monitor multiple servers ?  If the CPU usage for a core is "high" what would I use to determine the offending process and then how could I automatically kill that process if it was on the 'approved kill process' list?&lt;/p&gt;

There is a built-in "store the viewstate in the session state" provider.  If you are storing the session state in some fast, out of proc system, that might be the best option for the viewstate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;edit: to do this add the following code to the your Page classes / global page base class&lt;/p&gt;

        get { return new SessionPageStatePersister(this); }

&lt;p&gt;Also... this is by no means a perfect (or even good) solution to a large viewstate.  As always, minimize the size of the viewstate as much as possible.  However, the SessionPageStatePersister is relatively intelligent and avoids storing an unbounded number of viewstates per session as well as avoids storing only a single viewstate per session.&lt;/p&gt;

This report should show the code itself, with the first few columns marked up according to the coverage tool's particular notation on whether a given path was executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be able to use this straight up, or you might have to preprocess it and either remove the code that was not executed, or add a new notation on each line that tells whether it was executed (most tools will only show path information at control points):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So from a coverage tool you might get a report like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;T- if(sometest)
   {
x     somecode;
   }
   else
   {
-     someother_code;
   }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notation T- indicates that the if statement only ever evaluated to true, and so only the first part of the code executed.  The later notation 'x' indicates that this line was executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be able to form a regex that matches only when the first column contains a T, F, or x so you can capture all the control statements executed and lines executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you'll only get coverage information at each control point, which then requires you to parse the C file and mark the execute lines yourself.  Not as easy, but not impossible either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, this sounds like an interesting question where the solution is probably more work than it's worth...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are three advantages of Java
  using byte code instead of going to
  the native code of the system:&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portability&lt;/strong&gt;: Each kind of computer has its unique instruction
  set. While some processors include the
  instructions for their predecessors,
  it's generally true that a program
  that runs on one kind of computer
  won't run on any other. Add in the
  services provided by the operating
  system, which each system describes in
  its own unique way, and you have a
  compatibility problem. In general, you
  can't write and compile a program for
  one kind of system and run it on any
  other without a lot of work. Java gets
  around this limitation by inserting
  its virtual machine between the
  application and the real environment
  (computer + operating system). If an
  application is compiled to Java byte
  code and that byte code is interpreted
  the same way in every environment then
  you can write a single program which
  will work on all the different
  platforms where Java is supported.
  (That's the theory, anyway. In
  practice there are always small
  incompatibilities lying in wait for
  the programmer.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt;: One of Java's virtues is its integration into the Web. Load
  a web page that uses Java into your
  browser and the Java code is
  automatically downloaded and executed.
  But what if the code destroys files,
  whether through malice or sloppiness
  on the programmer's part? Java
  prevents downloaded applets from doing
  anything destructive by disallowing
  potentially dangerous operations.
  Before it allows the code to run it
  examines it for attempts to bypass
  security. It verifies that data is
  used consistently: code that
  manipulates a data item as an integer
  at one stage and then tries to use it
  as a pointer later will be caught and
  prevented from executing. (The Java
  language doesn't allow pointer
  arithmetic, so you can't write Java
  code to do what we just described.
  However, there is nothing to prevent
  someone from writing destructive byte
  code themselves using a hexadecimal
  editor or even building a Java byte
  code assembler.) It generally isn't
  possible to analyze a program's
  machine code before execution and
  determine whether it does anything
  bad. Tricks like writing
  self-modifying code mean that the evil
  operations may not even exist until
  later. But Java byte code was designed
  for this kind of validation: it
  doesn't have the instructions a
  malicious programmer would use to hide
  their assault.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt;: In the microprocessor world RISC is generally preferable
  over CISC. It's better to have a small
  instruction set and use many fast
  instructions to do a job than to have
  many complex operations implemented as
  single instructions. RISC designs
  require fewer gates on the chip to
  implement their instructions, allowing
  for more room for pipelines and other
  techniques to make each instruction
  faster. In an interpreter, however,
  none of this matters. If you want to
  implement a single instruction for the
  switch statement with a variable
  length depending on the number of case
  clauses, there's no reason not to do
  so. In fact, a complex instruction set
  is an advantage for a web-based
  language: it means that the same
  program will be smaller (fewer
  instructions of greater complexity),
  which means less time to transfer
  across our speed-limited network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when considering byte code vs native, consider which trade-offs you want to make between portability, security, size, and execution speed. If speed is the only important factor, go native. If any of the others are more important, go with bytecode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll also add that maintaining a series of OS and architecture-targeted compilations of the same code base for every release can become very tedious. It's a huge win to use the same Java bytecode on multiple platforms and have it "just work."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import pyPdf
pdf = pyPdf.PdfFileReader(open(filename, "rb"))

&lt;p&gt;A comment in the extractText code notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Locate all text drawing commands, in
  the order they are provided in the
  content stream, and extract the text. 
  This works well for some PDF files,
  but poorly for others, depending on
  the generator used.  This will be
  refined in the future.  Do not rely on
  the order of text coming out of this
  function, as it will change if this
  function is made more sophisticated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether or not this is a problem depends on what you're doing with the text (e.g. if the order doesn't matter, it's fine, or if the generator adds text to the stream in the order it will be displayed, it's fine).  I have pyPdf extraction code in daily use, without any problems.&lt;/p&gt;

For example if one of the arguments to a function is noted to always be NULL, all handling for that argument can simply be omitted from the native code.

&lt;p&gt;FWIW, for SpamBayes we support 2.2 and above (2.2 requires installing the email package separately).  This isn't overly taxing, but the 2.3 additions are useful enough and 2.3 old enough that we'll probably drop 2.2 before long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it won't give you the result you are looking for.  Unless a thread/process has been explicitly bound to a single CPU then a run-away process will not spike one core to 100% while all the others idle.  The run-away process will bounce around between all the processors.  I don't know why windows schedules threads this way, presumably because there is no gain from forcing affinity and some loss due to having to handle interrupts on particular cores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see this easily enough just in task manager.  Watch the individual CPU graphs when you have a single compute bound process running.&lt;/p&gt;

In fact I was all ready working my way to understanding that it could be done (for list or report view) with ListView_GetCountPerPage, and I would use you way to get it for for the others, though I don't need the ListView_ApproximateViewRect since I will all ready know the new size of the ListView.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Lars Truijens I am already using the LVN_ODCACHEHINT and had though about using that to set the buffer size, however I need to read to the end of the SQL data to find the last item to get the number of rows returned from ODBC.  Since that would be the best time to fill the 'end cache' I think I have to set up the number of items (and therefore fill the buffer) before we get a call to LVN_ODCACHEHIN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess my real question is one of optimization for which I think Brian hinted at the answer.   The amount of overhead in trashing your buffer and reallocating memory is smaller than the overhead of going out to the network and doing an ODBC read, some make the buffer fairly small and change it often rather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have done a little more playing around, and it seems that think that LVN_ODCACHEHINT generally fills the main buffer correctly, and only misses if a row (in report mode) is partially visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I think the answer for the size of the cache is: The total number of displayed items, plus one row of displayed items (since in the icons views you have multiple items per row).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would then re-read the cache with each WM_SIZE and LVN_ODCACHEHINT if either had a different begin and end item number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you checking the HTTP response code in your autoupdater? If not, you should check that your download succeeded (HTTP 200) before you perform a checksum. Ideally, your app should retry failed downloads, because transient errors are an unavoidable "feature" of S3 that clients need to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

While the performance packs offer the ability to use the native platform's media library, they're only offered for Linux, Solaris and Windows. Furthermore, &lt;strong&gt;Windows-based JMF developers can unwittingly think JMF provides support for more formats than it does&lt;/strong&gt;, and be surprised when their application is unable to play those formats on other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Another knock against JMF is Sun's seeming abandonment of it. The &lt;strong&gt;API has not been touched since 1999&lt;/strong&gt;, and the last news item on JMF's home page was posted in November 2004.&lt;/p&gt;

$select.addOption = function(value,text){

Developing with Java is about the same on any linux distro; you are going to wind up having to install the JDK and tools of your choosing (Eclipse, Sun Studio, Tomcat, etc) so you may as well choose a distro on other criteria... perhaps how comfortable you are with it, how easy package management is, and if the look &amp;amp; feel suit your development habits are all big factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to answer your question more directly, a Java developer would do well with any major linux distro that they are comfortable with using in general.

For example, I once saw a system where record IDs &gt; 0 were treated normally, 0 itself was "new record", -1 was "this is the root" and -99 was "this was created in the root". 0 and -99 would cause the WebService to supply a new ID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's bad about this is that you're reusing a space (that of signed integers for record IDs) for special abilities. Maybe you'll never want to create a record with ID 0, or with a negative ID, but even if not, every person who looks either at the code or at the database might stumble on this and be confused at first. It goes without saying those special values weren't well-documented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The library is very good, very fast and very useful. It has lots of very nice data structures, some of which I did not know before starting to use this library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's Open-Source! This is a huge benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes you don't have exactly what you want. As far as my experience showed, the library's authors decided to go with a very fault-intolerant attitude, throwing exceptions about everything. This caused me to add a few fault-tolerant methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, a very nice library with some advanced data structures. Unfortunately, support for it is very lacking, as you can see from the fact that new releases (bugfixes, et al) range somewhere from 6 months to a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the steps I'd follow:&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;GET the login form, capture the the cookie in the response.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using Xpath and HtmlAgilityPack, find the "input type=hidden" field names and values.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;POST to login form's action with user name, password, and hidden field values in the request body. Include the cookie in the request headers. Again, capture the cookie in the response.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GET the pages you want, again, with the cookie in the request headers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On step 2, I mention a somewhat complicated method for automating the login. Usually, you can post with username and password directly to the known login form action without getting the initial form or relaying the hidden fields. Some sites have form validation (different from field validation) on their forms which makes this method not work.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.codeplex.com/htmlagilitypack" rel="nofollow"&gt;HtmlAgilityPack&lt;/a&gt; is a .NET library that allows you to turn ill-formed html into an XmlDocument so you can XPath over it.

For every request, I get back (among other things) a list of which routes serve the stop in question. For example, if the list includes result for bus route #1, 2, and 5, then I know that those serve this stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a many-to-many relationship set up between Route and Stop, and I want to dynamically check and update these associations on every request. There is no "master list" of which routes serve which stops, so this seems like the best way to get this data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that the way I'm doing it now is very inefficient:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# routes is an array of [number, destination] that I build while iterating over the data
routes.uniq.each do |route|
  number      = route[0]
  destination = route[1]

  r = Route.find_by_number_and_destination(number, destination)

  if !r
    r = Route.new :number =&amp;gt; number, :destination =&amp;gt; destination
    r.save
  end

  # I have to check if it already exists because I can't find a way
  # to create a uniqueness constraint on the join table with 2 foreign keys
  r.stops &amp;lt;&amp;lt; stop unless r.stops.include? stop
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, I have to do 2 things for every route I find:
1) Create it if it doesn't already exist, 2) Add a relationship to the current stop if it doesn't already exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a better way to do this, for example by getting a bunch of the data in memory and doing some of the processing on the app server side, in order to avoid the multitude of database calls I'm currently doing?&lt;/p&gt;

However, you are right about that process creation plays a less important role on NT than on Unix as NT, in contrast to Unix, favors multithreading over multiprocessing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rob, it is true that fork is relatively cheap when COW is used, but as a matter of fact, fork is mostly followed by an exec. And an exec has to load all images as well. Discussing the performance of fork therefore is only part of the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When discussing the speed of process creation, it is probably a good idea to distinguish between NT and Windows/Win32. As far as NT (i.e. the kernel itself) goes, I do not think process creation (NtCreateProcess) and thread creation (NtCreateThread) is significantly slower as on the average Unix. There might be a little bit more going on, but I do not see the primary reason for the performance difference here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at Win32, however, you'll notice that it adds quite a bit of overhead to process creation. For one, it requires the CSRSS to be notified about process creation, which involves LPC. It requires at least kernel32 to be loaded additionally, and it has to perform a number of additional bookkeeping work items to be done before the process is considered to be a full-fledged Win32 process. And let's not forget about all the additional overhead imposed by parsing manifests, checking if the image requires a compatbility shim, checking whether software restriction policies apply, yada yada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I see the overall slowdown in the sum of all those little things that have to be done in addition to the raw creation of a process, VA space, and initial thread. But as said in the beginning -- due to the favoring of multithreading over multitasking, the only software that is seriously affected by this additional expense is poorly ported Unix software. Although this sitatuion changes when software like Chrome and IE8 suddenly rediscover the benefits of multiprocessing and begin to frequently start up and teardown processes...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CIL switch is a jump table, that requires an index into a set of jump addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is only useful if the C# switch's cases are adjacent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;case 3: blah; break;
case 4: blah; break;
case 5: blah; break;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of little use if they aren't:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;case 10: blah; break;
case 200: blah; break;
case 3000: blah; break;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(You'd need a table ~3000 entries in size, with only 3 slots used)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With non-adjacent expressions, the compiler may start to perform linear if-else-if-else checks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With larger non- adjacent expression sets, the compiler may start with a binary tree search, and finally if-else-if-else the last few items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With expression sets containing clumps of adjacent items, the compiler may binary tree search, and finally a CIL switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is full of "mays" &amp;amp; "mights", and it is dependent on the compiler (may differ with Mono or Rotor).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I replicated your results on my machine using adjacent cases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;total time to execute a 10 way switch, 10000 iterations (ms) : 25.1383&lt;br&gt;
  approximate time per 10 way switch (ms)                      : 0.00251383&lt;/p&gt;

  approximate time per 50 way switch (ms)                      : 0.0026593&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;total time to execute a 5000 way switch, 10000 iterations (ms) : 23.7094&lt;br&gt;
  approximate time per 5000 way switch (ms)                      : 0.00237094&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;total time to execute a 50000 way switch, 10000 iterations (ms) : 20.0933&lt;br&gt;
  approximate time per 50000 way switch (ms)                      : 0.00200933&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I also did using non-adjacent case expressions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;total time to execute a 10 way switch, 10000 iterations (ms) : 19.6189&lt;br&gt;
  approximate time per 10 way switch (ms)                      : 0.00196189&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;total time to execute a 500 way switch, 10000 iterations (ms) : 19.1664&lt;br&gt;
  approximate time per 500 way switch (ms)                      : 0.00191664&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;total time to execute a 5000 way switch, 10000 iterations (ms) : 19.5871&lt;br&gt;
  approximate time per 5000 way switch (ms)                      : 0.00195871&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;A non-adjacent 50,000 case switch statement would not compile.&lt;br&gt;
  "An expression is too long or complex to compile near 'ConsoleApplication1.Program.Main(string[])'    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's funny here, is that the binary tree search appears a little (probably not statistically) quicker than the CIL switch instruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian, you've used the word "&lt;strong&gt;constant&lt;/strong&gt;", which has a very definite meaning from a computational complexity theory perspective. While the simplistic adjacent integer example may produce CIL that is considered O(1) (constant), a sparse example is O(log n) (logarithmic), clustered examples lie somewhere in between, and small examples are O(n) (linear).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn't even address the String situation, in which a static &lt;code&gt;Generic.Dictionary&amp;lt;string,int32&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; may be created, and will suffer definite overhead on first use. Performance here will be dependent on the performance of &lt;code&gt;Generic.Dictionary&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you check the &lt;a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-334.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;C# Language Specification&lt;/a&gt; (not the CIL spec)
you'll find "15.7.2 The switch statement" makes no mention of "constant time" or that the underlying implementation even uses the CIL switch instruction (be very careful of assuming such things).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, a C# switch against an integer expression on a modern system is a sub-microsecond operation, and not normally worth worrying about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course these times will depend on machines and conditions. I wouldnt pay attention to these timing tests, the microsecond durations were talking about are dwarfed by any real code being run (and you must include some real code otherwise the compiler will optimise the branch away), or jitter in the system. My answers are based on using &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f7dy01k1(VS.80).aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;IL DASM&lt;/a&gt; to examine the CIL created by the C# compiler. Of course, this isnt final, as the actual instructions the CPU runs are then created by the JIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have checked the final CPU instructions actually executed on my x86 machine, and can confirm a simple adjacent set switch doing something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  jmp     ds:300025F0[eax*4]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

I try to avoid reflection whenever possible.  I have been burned many times after refactoring code which had reflection in it.  Code compiles fine, tests even run, but under special circumstances (which the tests didn't cover) the program blows up run-time because of my refactoring in one of the objects the reflection code poked into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflection in OR mapper, you change the name or the type of the property in your object model: Blows up run-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 2:&lt;/strong&gt; You are in a SOA shop.  Web Services are complete decoupled (or so you think).  They have their own set of generated proxy classes, but in the mapping you decide to save some time and you do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ExternalColor c = (ExternalColor)Enum.Parse(typeof(ExternalColor), 
                                            internalColor.ToString());
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the covers this is also reflection but done by the .net framework itself.  Now what happens if you decide to rename &lt;strong&gt;InternalColor.Grey&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;InternalColor.Gray&lt;/strong&gt;?  Everything looks ok, it builds fine, and even runs fine.. until the day some stupid user decides to use the color Gray... at which point the mapper will blow up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In .Net 2 you could mimic it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; DedupCollection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; ( IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; input ) {

                    .OpenSubKey("Main");

//Get the current setting so that we can revert it after printjob
var defaultValue = regKey.GetValue("Print_Background");
regKey.SetValue("Print_Background", "yes");

//Do the printing

//Revert the registry key to the original value
regKey.SetValue("Print_Background", defaultValue);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to handle this might be to just read the value, and notify the user to adjust this himself before printing. I have to agree that tweaking with the registry like this is not a good practice, so I am open for any suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at the .Net property grid - anyone who's used Visual Studio will be familiar with it. You can point it at any object and it it will produce a simple property editor. That uses reflection, in fact most of VS's toolbox does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at unit tests - they're loaded by reflection (at least in NUnit and MSTest).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflection allows dynamic-style behaviour from static languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing it really needs is duck typing - the C# compiler already supports this: you can &lt;code&gt;foreach&lt;/code&gt; anything that looks like &lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&lt;/code&gt;, whether it implements the interface or not.  You can use the C#3 collection syntax on any class that has a method called &lt;code&gt;Add&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use reflection wherever you need dynamic-style behaviour - for instance you have a collection of objects and you want to check the same property on each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risks are similar for dynamic types - compile time exceptions become run time ones. You code is not as 'safe' and you have to react accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The .Net reflection code is very quick, but not as fast as the explicit call would have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To confirm the behaviour I created a standalone WinForms app with a timer to check the MainWindowHandle of the "DEVENV" (Visual Studio) process every 100ms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the interesting part of this test app...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    IntPtr oldHWnd = IntPtr.Zero;

    void GetMainwindowHandle()
    {
        Process[] processes = Process.GetProcessesByName("DEVENV");

        if (processes.Length!=1)
            return;

        IntPtr newHWnd = processes[0].MainWindowHandle;

        if (newHWnd != oldHWnd)
        {
            oldHWnd = newHWnd;
            textBox1.AppendText(processes[0].MainWindowHandle.ToString("X")+"\r\n");
        }

    }

    private void timer1Tick(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        GetMainwindowHandle();
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the value of MainWindowHandle changing when you (for example) click on a drop-down menu inside VS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i37.tinypic.com/11ky1yb.jpg" alt="MainWindowHandleMystery" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I've misunderstood the documentation.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can anyone shed light?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Atwood: Well, I originally asked on Twitter, because I just wanted something light weight.  I really didn't want to like write a windows service.  I felt like that was out of band code. Plus the code that actually does the work is a web page in fact, because to me that is a logical unit of work on a website is a web page.  So, it really is like we are calling back into the web site, it's just like another request in the website, so I viewed it as something that should stay inline, and the little approach that we came up that was recommended to me on Twitter was to essentially to add something to the application cache with a fixed expiration, then you have a call back so when that expires it calls a certain function which does the work then you add it back in to the cache with the same expiration.  So, it's a little bit, maybe "ghetto" is the right word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My approach has always been to have to OS (i.e. Cron or the Windows task scheduler) load a specific URL at some interval, and then setup a page at that URL to check it's queue, and perform whatever tasks were required, but I'd be interested to hear if there's a better way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the transcript, it looks like FogBugz uses the windows service loading a URL approach also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Spolsky: So we have this special page called heartbeat.asp.  And that page, whenever you hit it, and anybody can hit it at anytime: doesn't hurt.  But when that page runs it checks a queue of waiting tasks to see if there's anything that needs to be done.  And if there's anything that needs to be done, it does one thing and then looks in that queue again and if there's anything else to be done it returns a plus, and the entire web page that it returns is just a single character with a plus in it.  And if there's nothing else to be done, the queue is now empty, it returns a minus.  So, anybody can call this and hit it as many times, you can load up heartbeat.asp in your web browser you hit Ctrl-R Ctrl-R Ctrl-R Ctrl-R until you start getting minuses instead of pluses.  And when you've done that FogBugz will have completed all of its maintenance work that it needs to do.  So that's the first part, and the second part is a very, very simple Windows service which runs, and its whole job is to call heartbeat.asp and if it gets a plus, call it again soon, and if it gets a minus call it again, but not for a while.  So basically there's this Windows service that's always running, that has a very, very, very simple task of just hitting a URL, and looking to see if it gets a plus or a minus and, and then scheduling when it runs again based on whether it got a plus or a minus.  And obviously you can do any kind of variation you want on this theme, like for example, uh you could actually, instead of returning just a plus or minus you could say "Okay call me back in 60 seconds" or "Call me back right away I have more work to be done."  And that's how it works... so that maintenance service it just runs, you know, it's like, you know, a half page of code that runs that maintenance service, and it never has to change, and it doesn't have any of the logic in there, it just contains the tickling that causes these web pages to get called with a certain guaranteed frequency.  And inside that web page at heartbeat.asp there's code that maintains a queue of tasks that need to be done and looks at how much time has elapsed and does, you know, late-night maintenance and every seven days delete all the older messages that have been marked as spam and all kinds of just maintenance background tasks.  And uh, that's how that does that.&lt;/p&gt;

    return (!(NativeMethods.GetWindow(new HandleRef(this, handle), 4) != IntPtr.Zero)

&lt;p&gt;The same practice and library that can be applied to both Java and C# platforms, targeting the Windows, or Linux as application platforms, makes development on different platforms easier than needing to learn different frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although i'm planning to exmine the Subsonic, iBatis and LINQ, for now Hibernate and NHibernate seem like the right tool for the job while i have to target both Windows and Linux platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your situation (need to run background tasks in a web application) you could use the ServletContextListener included in the distribution to &lt;a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/quartz/api/org/quartz/ee/servlet/QuartzInitializerListener.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;initialize the engine at the startup of your web container&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that you have a number of possibilities to start (trigger) your background tasks (jobs), e.g. you can use Calendars or cron-like expressions. In your situation most probably you should settle with &lt;a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/quartz/api/org/quartz/SimpleTrigger.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;SimpleTrigger&lt;/a&gt; that lets you run jobs in fixed, regular intervals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jobs themselves can be described easily too in Quartz, however you haven't provided any details about what you need to run, so I can't provide a suggestion in that area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day I finally realized that all these books were trying to do was prevent me from making mistakes ... which is exactly the opposite of how me, and most people learn.  &lt;em&gt;Smart&lt;/em&gt; people make mistakes, and fail, quite frequently, but what makes them different is that they &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt; from their mistakes.  How could I learn when the books I was reading were preventing my from some &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; life lessons?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So from that point on I stopped reading non-technical books ... save for the ones that related to technical management .. which there aren't many.

I learned more from these brillant, crazy, egocentric, often times failures that I learned from any of the business books I previously read!  &lt;/p&gt;

Not a show stoper but I'm used to opening the front page of the site, there's a small login form, firefox' password manager already filled in the correct values, submit, done. One click.
Here - and it's currently the only site with openid I use - the password/form manager doesn't even fill in my "login id". I often close all browser windows and all cookies are erased - and I would like to keep it this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any firefox plugins you would recommend that make the login process easier? Maybe something that checks my status at myOpenId and performs the login if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately RichQ is right and I can't use Seatbelt. And Sxipper ...not quite what I had in mind ;) Anyway, both solutions would take away some of the "pain", so upvotes for both of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've also tried the ssl certificate. But that only adds more steps. Hopefully I did something wrong and some of those steps can be eliminated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click "login" at stackoverflow
&lt;li&gt;Click on the "select provider" Button.
&lt;li&gt;Click on MyOpenId
&lt;li&gt;Enter Username
&lt;li&gt;Click "Login" (Sxipper could reduce the previous 4 steps to a single mouseclick)
&lt;li&gt;MyOpenId login page is loaded
&lt;li&gt;Click "Sign in with an SSL certificate"
&lt;li&gt;Choose Certificate (grrr)
&lt;li&gt;Click "Login" (GRRR)
&lt;li&gt;Back to stackoverflow, finally.
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I really would like is:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click "login" at stackoverflow
&lt;li&gt;My (only) LoginId is filled in
&lt;li&gt;Click "Login"
&lt;li&gt;If necessary the certificate is chosen automagically, ssl login performed
&lt;li&gt;Back to stackoverflow without any further user interaction.
&lt;/ul&gt;That would be more or less what I'm used to - and I'm a creature of habit :)&lt;/p&gt;

//do something 
//...much later, a has been garbage-collected away.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, .Net informs me that I've already got a socket bound to 127.0.0.1:4567, which is technically true.  But no matter what code I put in ClassA's destructor, or no matter what functions I call on the socket (I've tried .Close() and .Disconnect(true)), the socket remains proudly bound to 127.0.0.1:4567.  What do I do to be able to 'un-bind' the socket?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I'm not relying solely on garbage collection (though I tried that approach as well).  I tried calling a.Close() or a.Disconnect() and only then instantiating aa; this doesn't solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I've also tried implementing IDisposable, but the code never got there without my calling the method (which was the equivalent of earlier attempts, as the method would simply try .Close and .Disconnect).  Let me try calling .Dispose directly and get back to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT (lots of edits, apologies): Implementing IDisposable and calling a.Dispose() from where 'a' loses scope doesn't work - my Dispose implementation still has to call either .Close or .Disconnect(true) (or .Shutdown(Both)) but none of those unbind the socket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any help would be appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

I'm &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; interested in PHP or perl or web development.  I want to &lt;em&gt;exclude&lt;/em&gt; such posts.  But with the tags, I can't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although discrete subforums are in a sense less flexible, as they generally force you to pick a category even if a question might fit into two (if SO had, say, areas for "Web Development", "Games development", "Computer Science", "Systems Programming", "Databases", etc. then sure, some people might want to post about developing of web-based games, for example) is it worth sacrificing some of that flexibility in order to make it easier to find the content that you are interested in, and hide the content that you are not interested in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any way with a pure tagging system to achieve the greater ease of use that subforums provide?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team normally consists of about 4 developers and 2 testers. The scrum master insists that every team member should contribute equally to the velocity calculation i.e. we should not distinguish between developers and testers when working out how much we can do in a sprint. The is correct according to Scrum, but here's the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite suggestions to the contrary, testers never help with non-test tasks and developers never help with non-dev tasks, so we are not cross functional team members at all. Also, despite various suggestions, testers normally spend the first few days of each sprint waiting for something to test. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end result is that typically we take on far more dev work than we actually have capacity for in the sprint. For example, the developers might contribute 20 days to the velocity calculation and the testers 10 days. If you add up the tasks after sprint planning though, dev tasks add up to 25 days and test tasks add up to 5 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you guys deal with this sort of situation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your query's a start, but it might not work when you have multiple schemas.  For example, if I log into our instance as myself, I have read access to all our tables.  But if I don't qualify the table name with the schema I'll get an ORA-00942 for tables without synonyms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
SQL&gt; select * from tools; 
select * from tools 
              * 
ERROR at line 1: 
ORA-00942: table or view does not exist 
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The table still shows up in all_tables though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
SQL&gt; select owner, table_name from all_tables where table_name = 'TOOLS';

Buying TFS with the intention of only using it for Version Control would clearly be a waste of money.  TFS is an integrated suite of tools to automate all aspects of Application Lifecycle Management (and pretty much geared to "The Enterprise".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also per Ben S's post - I don't understand your comment about locks.  Locks aren't required in TFS at all.  Administrators can configure TFS to work like VSS (features demanded by some "unwise" customers) to "Get-Latest on Checkout" which I believe also does a check-out lock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But through "normal" use of TFS a "check-out" prompts a user for the lock type - and the default should be "none".  A user CAN select a check-out (or a check-in lock) - but it is not required.  If you don't want locks, don't use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TFS does track which users have check-outs on the server for various both performance reasons (make get-latest faster) and project management (I like to see what developers have files checked out and how long their check-outs are).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not real familiar with SVN (I've never used it) - so I can't comment that "mergeing is worse with TFS" - and haven't hit the merge bug Ben S reported - but I've had great success with branching and merging using TFS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One use case I know TFS is still pretty weak at is for users who are regularly "offline".  TFS is a "Server Product" that assumes the users are connected the majority of the time. The offline experience improved in the 2008 release (it was dismal in 2005) but still has a long way to go.  If you have developers who need (or want) to often be disconnected from the network for long periods of time - you are likely better off with SVN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another feature to consider for SVN fans who are using TFS is the &lt;a href="http://www.codeplex.com/SvnBridge"&gt;SVN Bridge&lt;/a&gt; a codeplex which allows users to use TortiseSVN to connect to TFS.  I good friend and colleague of mine uses it extensively and loves it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also the comment about a lack of command line surprises me - the command line tools are extensive (although many require a seperate download of &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/tfs2008/bb980963.aspx"&gt;TFS Power Tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect Ben's comments are based on an eval of the 2005 release which was clearly a "Microsoft V1.0" product.  The product is currently in 2.1 with Version 3 coming in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a specific example of a project I'm working on : a list of unique id / name pairs are being retrieved from a remote web-service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this list will change infrequently (once per day), &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;will be read-only from the point of view of the application where it is being used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;will be stored at the application level for all requests to access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given those points, I plan to store the returned values at the application level in a singleton class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial approach was to iterate through the list returned from the remote service and store it in a NameValueCollection in a singleton class, with methods to retrieve from the collection based on an id:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sugarsoap soapService = new sugarsoap();
branch_summary[] branchList = soapService.getBranches();

foreach (branch_summary aBranch in branchList)
{
    branchNameList.Add(aBranch.id, aBranch.name);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alternative using LINQ is to simply add a method that works on the list directly once it has been retrieved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public string branchName (string branchId) 
{
    //branchList populated in the constructor
    branch_summary bs = from b in branchList where b.id == branchId select b;
    return branch_summary.name;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is either better than the other - is there a third way?  I'm open to all answers, for both approaches and both in terms of solutions that offer elegance, and those which benefit performance.&lt;/p&gt;

(Or, better yet, before a check-in from a PR or DPK) Simply put, I am still extremely familiar with my code, so most bug fixes become super simple. With this approach, I tend to leave roughly 15% of my dev time to bug fixing. At least when I do estimates. So in a 16 week run I'd leave around 2-3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

You need to know average bugs-per-loc number to estimate total bugs count.

Having used both, and worked with very large companies in implementing TFS, here's my two cents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) If you are using TFS 2005, upgrade to TFS 2008. You'll thank me. There are a ton of improvements in TFS 2008 that make it workable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) If you live in Visual Studio and you want the IDE integration, go with TFS. I've used SVN integration and almost always drop back to using TortoiseSVN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) If you like the idea of accounts being integrated with Windows Authentication, go with TFS. The manageability from that end is nice. There may be hooks for SVN - I'm not positive, but if you like the GUI driven management, TFS is hard to beat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) If you need to track metrics or have easier ways of implementing things like check-in policies, go with TFS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) If you have people who won't implement it if it isn't MSFT, go with TFS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) If you do more than just .NET (Java work, Eclipse, etc) go with SVN. Yes there are very good products out there (like Teamprise) that work well with TFS. But unless the other languages are a small part of your shop, just stick with SVN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of that, the SCM features of both are about equivalent. They both do branching and merging, the both do atomic check-ins, they both support renames and moves. I think for people just getting started with the branching and merging concept, having the branches be visible in Source Control Explorer is nice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TFS really isn't that expensive ($1200 maybe?). Compared to SVN it is, perhaps. The integration to reporting services and SharePoint is nice, but again, if you aren't using that, then it doesn't matter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I'd say is to download the 180-day trial of TFS and give it a go. Run a trial side-by-side. I think you'll be happy no matter which way you go.&lt;/p&gt;

That isn't a properly integrated team but neither is yours from the sound of it.

&lt;p&gt;List, Map and Set serve different purposes. I suggest reading about the Java Collections Framework at &lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/collections/interfaces/index.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/collections/interfaces/index.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be a bit more concrete:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use List if you need an array-like data structure and you need to iterate over the elements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use Map if you need something like a dictionary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use a Set if you only need to decide if something belongs to the set or not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About your second question...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main difference between Vector and ArrayList is that the former is synchronized, the latter is not synchronized. You can read more about synchronization in &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0321349601" rel="nofollow"&gt;Java Concurrency in Practice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between Hashtable (note that the T is not a capital letter) and HashMap is similiar, the former is synchronized, the latter is not synchronized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say that there are no rule of thumb for preferring one implementation or another, it really depends on your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

Another thing to add with that approach - you may have decided over time that you want to refactor the way your application is organized (folders etc) and this will give you an oppurtunity to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been in situations where we organized a solution haphazardly without thought (let alone major changes in the application) which led to a desire to organize things differently - and the move from VSS to TFS is a great oppurtunity to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as the original question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And: this migration will for sure mean that our working habits have to be modified in some way. Do you think that this changes could be a problem for the organization? Think to a group of about 20 .net developers, in a single site&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say - yes your working habits will change but much more for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You no should use "Check-out" Locks and "Get-Latest on Check-out".  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can now effectively Branch and Merge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will now have "Changesets" all files checked-in at the same time will be grouped together.  This makes historical change tracking much easier - but more importantly - rollbacks are much easier (ie find all files checked in at the same time and roll them back)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Associating Check-ins to Work Items.  Don't overlook Work Items!  The biggest mistake you can make is to only use TFS as a VSS replacement.  The Build and Project Management features are excellent - you paid for them  - USE THEM!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Rob Rolnick says 1:1 is a good rule of thumb- however in cases where a specification is bad the client may push for "bugs" which are actually badly specified features. I was recently involved in a project which used many releases but more time was spent on bug fixing than actual development due to the terrible specification. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensure a good specification/design and your testing/bug fixing time will be reduced because it will be easier for testers to see what and how to test and any clients will have less lee-way to push for extra features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Main Level contains:
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;separate folders for css, images, js, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;folders that hold .html templates for subdirecty-type urls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.bowlsk.com/"&gt;http://www.bowlsk.com/&lt;/a&gt; maps to HomePage (default package), template at "index.html"&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.bowlsk.com/games/view-series.html?series=7130"&gt;http://www.bowlsk.com/games/view-series.html?series=7130&lt;/a&gt; maps to ViewSeriesPage (again, default package), template at "games/view-series.html"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's nasty.  How do I restructure?  I had 2 ideas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Main Folder containing: appdef, indexes, main.py?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subfolder for code.  Does this have to be my first package?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subfolder for templates.  Folder heirarchy would match package heirarchy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individual subfolders for css, images, js, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Main Folder containing appdef, indexes, main.py?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subfolder for code + templates.  This way I have the handler class right next to the template, because in this stage, I'm adding lots of features, so modifications to one mean modifications to the other.  Again, do I have to have this folder name be the first package name for my classes?  I'd like the folder to be "src", but I don't want my classes to be "src.WhateverPage"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a best practice?  With Django 1.0 on the horizon, is there something I can do now to improve my ability to integrate with it when it becomes the official GAE templating engine?  I would simply start trying these things, and seeing which seems better, but pyDev's refactoring support doesn't seem to handle package moves very well, so it will likely be a non-trivial task to get all of this working again.&lt;/p&gt;

Why you would choose between their implementing classes is another thing. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ArrayList&lt;/strong&gt; is quick on retrieving, but slow on inserting. It's good for an implementation that reads a lot but doesn't insert/remove a lot. It keeps its data in one continuous block of memory, so every time it needs to expand, it copies the whole array.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LinkedList&lt;/strong&gt; is slow on retrieving, but quick on inserting. It's good for an implementation that inserts/removes a lot but doesn't read a lot. It doesn't keep the entire array in one continuous block of memory.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HashSet&lt;/strong&gt; doesn't guarantee the order of iteration, and therefore is fastest of the sets. It has high overhead and is slower than ArrayList, so you shouldn't use it except for a large amount of data when its hashing speed becomes a factor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TreeSet&lt;/strong&gt; keeps the data ordered, therefore is slower than HashSet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Map:&lt;/strong&gt; The performance and behavior of HashMap and TreeMap are parallel to the Set implementations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vector and Hashtable should not be used. They are synchronized implementations, before the release of the new Collection hierarchy, thus slow. If synchronization is needed, use Collections.synchronizedCollection().&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that isn't the exact signature, there is also &lt;code&gt;CeRunAppAtEvent&lt;/code&gt;, they should both be in the MSDN docs (but linking is useless the way MSDN urls always change)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The normal way to use these (and &lt;code&gt;RunAppAtTime&lt;/code&gt; in the managed world via &lt;code&gt;OpenNETCF.Win32.Notify&lt;/code&gt; ) is that for periodic execution, every time your app runs, it will rescedule itself for its next run-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your app is running, the new instance should bring up the already running process. If it isn't running, then it is just like starting up normally - from mmory it passes some argument to the process so it can tell it is being scheduled and not started some other way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assume you will have a refresh method on the singleton class for when the properties need to change and also that you have some way of notifying the singleton to update when the list changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both solutions are viable. I think LINQ will populate the collection faster in the constructor (but not noticeably faster). Traditional collection based approaches are fine. Personally, I would choose the LINQ version if only because it is new tech and I like to use it. Assuming your deployment environment has .NET 3.5...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have a method on your webservice for getting branches by Id? That would be the third option if the branch info is needed infrequently.&lt;/p&gt;

I have just undergone converting my company's web application from a custom in-house ORM layer into sqlAlchemy so I am far from an expert but something that occurred to me was that sqlAlchemy has types for all of the attributes it maps from the database so why not use that to help output the right html onto the page. So we use sqlAlchemy for the back end and Cheetah templates for the front end but everything in between is basically our own still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have never managed to find a framework that does exactly what we want without compromise and prefer to get all the bits that work right for us and write the glue our selves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 1. For each data type sqlAlchemy.types.INTEGER etc. Add an extra function toHtml (or many maybe toHTMLReadOnly, toHTMLAdminEdit whatever) and just have that return the template for the html, now you don't even have to care what data type your displaying if you just want to spit out a whole table you can just do (as a cheetah template or what ever your templating engine is).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt; &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;  #for $field in $dbObject.c:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &amp;lt;th&amp;gt;$field.name&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;  #end for  &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt; &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt; &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;  #for $field in dbObject.c:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;$field.type.toHtml($field.name, $field.value)&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;  #end for  &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt; &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/table&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this basic method and stretching pythons introspection to its potential, in an afternoon I managed to make create read update and delete code for our whole admin section of out database, not yet with the polish of django but more then good enough for my needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 3 Discovered the need for a third step just on Friday, wanted to upload files which as you know needs more then just the varchar data types default text box. No sweat, I just overrode the rows class in my table definition from VARCHAR to FilePath(VARCHAR) where the only difference was FilePath had a different toHtml method. Worked flawlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that said, if there is a shrink wrapped one out there that does just what you want, use that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indices on cross table should be enough optimisation. Selecting appropriate items would be  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM items WHERE id IN  
    (SELECT DISTINCT item_id FROM item_tag WHERE

    AND ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which is admittedly, not so efficient for large number of comparing tags. If you are to maintain tag count in memory, you could make query to start with tags that are not often, so AND sequence would be evaluated quicker. Depending on expected number of tags to be matched against and expectancy of matching any single of them this could be OK solution, if you are to match 20 tags, and expect that some random item will match 15 of them, then this would still be heavy on a database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My approach is to have a Tag Table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; TagId (PK)| TagName (Indexed)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, you have a TagXREFID column in your items table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This TagXREFID column is a FK to a 3rd table, I'll call it TagXREF:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; TagXrefID | ItemID | TagId
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to get all tags for an item would be something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT Tags.TagId,Tags.TagName 
     FROM Tags,TagXref 
     WHERE TagXref.TagId = Tags.TagId 
         AND TagXref.ItemID = @ItemID
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to get all items for a tag, I'd use something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM Items, TagXref
     WHERE TagXref.TagId IN 
          ( SELECT Tags.TagId FROM Tags
                WHERE Tags.TagName = @TagName; )
     AND Items.ItemId = TagXref.ItemId;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To AND a bunch of tags together, You would to modify the above statement slightly to add AND Tags.TagName = @TagName1 AND Tags.TagName = @TagName2 etc...and dynamically build the query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Build it yourself, running something like Linux or *BSD. The benefit of this, is that it makes it easy to do the dynamic part of your question, it's just a matter of a few well-placed shell/python/perl/whatever scripts. The drawback is that your ceiling traffic rate might not be what it would be on a purpose-built firewall device, although you should still be able to achieve data rates in the 300Mbit/sec range. (You start hitting PCI bus limitations at this point) This may be high enough to where it won't be a problem for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buy a dedicated "firewall device" - Possible drawbacks of doing this, is that doing the "dynamic" part of what you're trying to accomplish is somewhat more difficult - depending on the device, this could be easy (Net::Telnet/Net::SSH come to mind), or not. If you are worried about peak traffic rates, you'll have to carefully check the manufacturer's specifications - several of these devices are prone to the same traffic limitations as "regular" PC's, in that they still run into the PCI bus bandwidth issue, etc. At that point, you might as well roll your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess you could read this more as a "pro's and con's" of doing either, if you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FWIW, we run dual FreeBSD firewalls at my place of employment, and regularly push 40+Mbit/sec with no noticeable load/issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vector and Hashtable are synchronised and therefore might be a bit slower.

In the case of Map, ConcurrentMap adds extra operations to make the interface useful. ConcurrentHashMap is a good implementation of ConcurrentMap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LinkedList is almost never a good idea. Even if you are doing a lot of insertions and removal, if you are using an index to indicate position then that requires iterating through the list to find the correct node. ArrayList is almost always faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Map and Set, the hash variants will be faster than tree/sorted. Hash algortihms tend to have O(1) performance, whereas trees will be O(log n).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# First, find all the relevant routes, just for caching.

r.stops &amp;lt;&amp;lt; stop

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;
.containerdiv { float: left; position: relative; } 
.cornerimage { position: absolute; top: 0; right: 0; }

&lt;p&gt;I suspect that &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/48474#48484" rel="nofollow"&gt;Espo's solution&lt;/a&gt; may be inconvenient because it requires you to position both images absolutely. You may want the first one to position itself in the flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, there is a natural way to do that is CSS. You put position: relative on the container element, and then absolutely position children inside it. Unfortunately, you cannot put one image inside another. That's why I needed container div. Notice that I made it a float to make it autofit to its contents. Making it display: inline-block should theoretically work as well, but browser support is poor there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I deleted size attributes from the images to illustrate my point better. If you want the container image to have its default sizes and you don't know the size beforehand, you cannot use the &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/48474/how-do-i-position-one-image-on-top-of-another-in-html#48482" rel="nofollow"&gt;background trick&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;There isn't really a direct equivalent though, finalisers look like C destructors, but behave differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You're supposed to nest &lt;code&gt;using&lt;/code&gt; blocks, that's why the C# code layout defaults to putting them on the same line...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;using (SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection("DB con str") )
using (SqlCommand com = new SqlCommand( con, "sql query") )
{

    //technically we're nested twice
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you're not using &lt;code&gt;using&lt;/code&gt; you can just do what it does under the hood anyway:&lt;/p&gt;

try
{

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Items (ID pk, Name, &amp;lt;properties&amp;gt;)
Tags (ID pk, Name)
TagItems (TagID fk, ItemID fk)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works fast for the write times, and keeps everything normalized, but you may also note that for each tag, you'll need to join tables twice for every further tag you want to AND, so it's got slow read. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A solution to improve read is to create a caching table on command by setting up a stored procedure that essentially creates  new table that represents the data in a flattened format...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CachedTagItems(ID, Name, &amp;lt;properties&amp;gt;, tag1, tag2, ... tagN)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you can consider how often the Tagged Item table needs to be kept up to date, if it's on every insert, then call the stored procedure in a cursor insert event. If it's an hourly task, then set up an hourly job to run it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to get really clever in data retrieval, you'll want to create a stored procedure to get data from the tags. Rather than using nested queries in a massive case statement, you want to pass in a single parameter containing a list of tags you want to select from the database, and return a record set of Items. This would be best in binary format, using bitwise operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In binary format, it is easy to explain. Let's say there are four tags to be assigned to an item, in binary we could represent that &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;0000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all four tags are assigned to an object, the object would look like this...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1111
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If just the first two...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1100
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it's just a case of finding the binary values with the 1s and zeros in the column you want. Using SQL Server's Bitwise operators, you can check that there is a 1 in the first of the columns using very simple queries.&lt;/p&gt;

Given that you are on a shared host, it is improbable that you can access to that file, and even if you would access it, it is probable that it contains then entries for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the websites hosted on the given machine (setting up separate logging for each VirtualHost is certainly possible with Apache, but I don't know if it is a common practice).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possible workaround would be for you to write out a logfile from your pages. However this is rather difficult and can have a severe performance impact (you have to serialize the writes to the logfile for one, if you don't want to get garbage from time to time). All in all, I would suggest going with an online analytics service, like Google Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to modify this &lt;a href="http://wordaligned.org/articles/a-subversion-pre-commit-hook" rel="nofollow"&gt;script&lt;/a&gt; to validate that the check-in file does not have a Carriage Return in the EOL formatting. The EOL format is CR LF in Windows and LF in Unix. When a User checks-in code with the Windows format. It does not compile in Unix anymore. I know this can be done on the client side but I need to have this validation done on the server side. To achieve this, I need to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Make sure the file I check is not a binary, I dont know how to do this with svnlook, should I check the mime:type of the file? The &lt;a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.reposadmin.create.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Red Book&lt;/a&gt; does not indicate this clearly or I must have not seen it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) I would like to run the &lt;a href="http://linux.about.com/od/commands/l/blcmdl1_dos2uni.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;dos2unix&lt;/a&gt; command to validate that the file has the correct EOL format. I would compare the output of the dos2unix command against the original file. If there is a diff between both, I give an error message to the client and cancel the check-in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like your comments/feedback on this approach&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

Basically some resource-intensive calls that get queued, cached, and dispatched when the underlying system gets around to it.  When the asynchronous call finally receives a response I would like a callback event to be raised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am having some problems coming up with a mechanism to do callbacks in PHP.  I have come up with a method that works for now but I am unhappy with it.  Basically it involves passing a reference to the object and the name of the method on it that will serve as the callback (taking the response as an argument) and then use eval to call the method when need be.  This is sub-optimal for a variety of reasons, is there a better way of doing this that anyone knows of? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Apache configuration, I add directives like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Directory /data/www/path/to/some/site/js/&amp;gt;
 AddHandler application/x-httpd-php .js
 php_value auto_prepend_file gzip-js.php

&amp;lt;/Directory&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;gzip-js.php in the &lt;code&gt;js&lt;/code&gt; directory looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?php
 header("Content-type: text/javascript; charset: UTF-8");

 header("Content-type: text/css; charset: UTF-8");
?&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Technically, you can achieve loose coupling with both -- the underlying implementation is still not exposed to the calling code, and you can use Abstract Factory pattern to return an underlying implementation (interface implementation vs. abstract class extension) to increase the flexibility of your design. In fact, you could argue that abstract classes give you slightly more, since they allow you to both require implementations to satisfy your code ("you MUST implement start()") and provide default implementations ("I have a standard paint() you can override if you want to") -- with interfaces, implementations must be provided, which over time can lead to brittle inheritance problems through interface changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, though, I use interfaces mainly due to Java's single inheritance restriction. If my implementation MUST inherit from an abstract class to be used by calling code, that means I lose the flexibility to inherit from something else even though that may make more sense (e.g. for code reuse or object hierarchy).&lt;/p&gt;

For every "new" or dynamic memory allocation there needs to be a "delete" a memory de-allocation. Some times the "delete" can be hidden, as with smartpointers but it is still there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int main()
{
  int *pI = new int;
  int *pArr = new int[10];
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so far in the code we have allocated two chunks of dynamic memory. The first is just a general int the second is an array of ints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  delete pI;
  delete [] pArr;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;these delete statements clear the memory that was allocated by the "new"s&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  int ppArr = new int *[10];

  for( int indx = 0; indx &amp;lt; 10; ++indx )
  {
    ppArr[indx] = new int;
  }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bit of code is doing both of the previous allocations.  First we are creating space for our int in a dynamic array.  We then need to loop through and allocate an int for each spot in the array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  for( int indx = 0; indx &amp;lt; 10; ++indx )
  {
    delete ppArr[indx];
  }
  delete [] ppArr;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the order that I allocated this memory and then that I de-allocated it in the reverse order. This is because if we were to do the delete [] ppArr; first we would loose the array that tells us what our other pointers are. That chunk or memory would be given back to the system and so can no longer be reliably read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  int a=0;
  int b=1;
  int c=2;

  ppArr = new int *[3];

  ppArr[0] = &amp;amp;a;
  ppArr[1] = &amp;amp;b;
  ppArr[2] = &amp;amp;c;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This I think should be mentioned as well. Just because you are working with pointers does not mean that the memory those pointers point to was dynamically allocated. That is to say just because you have a pointer doesn't mean it necessarily needs to be delete. The array I created here is dynamically allocated but the pointers point to local instances of ints When we delete this we only need to delete the array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  delete [] ppArr;

  return 0;

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end dynamically allocated memory can be tricky and anyway you can wrap it up safely like in a smart pointer or by using stl containers rather then your own can make your life much more pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;... anonymous types [are] a great tool for quick and simple temporary results.  We don't need to declare classes to hold temporary results thanks to temporary types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;basically they're useful to hold information in the local scope temporarily.  Anything more requires the use of reflection and can become quite a problem.  The example they give in the above-quoted book is in writing to console the id, name, and amount of memory taken up by each running process.  They create an anonymous type, add it to a list (all one statement) and then use ObjectDumper to output it.  Therefore the code no longer needs a separately declared class to hold the id, name and memory used but its all declared implicitly bringing the line count down to 4:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var pl = new List&amp;lt;Object&amp;gt;();
foreach(var p in Process.GetProcesses())
  pl.Add(new {p.Id, p.ProcessName, Memory=p.WorkingSet64});
ObjectDumper.Write(pl);

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Required for GoF type patterns, such as the visitor pattern&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allows for alternate implementations.  For example, multiple data access object implementations may exist for a single interface that abstracts the database engine in use (AccountDaoMySQL and AccountDaoOracle may both implement AccountDao)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Class may implement multiple interfaces.  Java does not allow multiple inheritance of concrete classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstracts implementation details.  Interfaces may include only public API methods, hiding  implementation details.  Benefits include a cleanly documented public API and well documented contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Used heavily by modern dependency injection frameworks, such as &lt;a href="http://www.springframework.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.springframework.org/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Java, interfaces can be used to create dynamic proxies - &lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/Proxy.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/Proxy.html&lt;/a&gt;.  This can be used very effectively with frameworks such as Spring to perform Aspect Oriented Programming. Aspects can add very useful functionality to Classes without directly adding java code to those classes.  Examples of this functionality include logging, auditing, performance monitoring, transaction demarcation, etc.  &lt;a href="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/aop.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/aop.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mock implementations, unit testing - When dependent classes are implementations of interfaces, mock classes can be written that also implement those interfaces.  The mock classes can be used to facilitate unit testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;copying some text from the technet blog:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So looking at the definition of buffered I/O above, we can see where the perceived performance problems lie - in the file system cache overhead.  Unbuffered I/O (or a raw file copy) is preferred when attempting to copy a large file from one location to another when we do not intend to access the source file after the copy is complete.  This will avoid the file system cache overhead and prevent the file system cache from being effectively flushed by the large file data.  Many applications accomplish this by calling CreateFile() to create an empty destination file, then using the ReadFile() and WriteFile() functions to transfer the data.
CreateFile() - The CreateFile function creates or opens a file, file stream, directory, physical disk, volume, console buffer, tape drive, communications resource, mailslot, or named pipe. The function returns a handle that can be used to access an object. 
ReadFile() - The ReadFile function reads data from a file, and starts at the position that the file pointer indicates. You can use this function for both synchronous and asynchronous operations. 
WriteFile() - The WriteFile function writes data to a file at the position specified by the file pointer. This function is designed for both synchronous and asynchronous operation.
For copying files around the network that are very large, my copy utility of choice is ESEUTIL which is one of the database utilities provided with Exchange.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

The model has 10-15 persistent classes with 3-5 levels of depth in the relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then have a separate jvm that is the server using this data.  As it is running continuously we just have one long db session (read only).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is currently no intra-jvm cache involved - so we manually signal one jvm from the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when the webapp changes some data, it signals the server to reload the changed data.  What we have found is that we need to tell hibernate to purge the data and then reload it.  Just doing a fetch/merge with the db does not do the job - mainly in respect of the objects several layers down the hierarchy.  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;with loss tolerant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you mean "with loss tolerance" ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, UDP is not "loss tolerant". You can send 100 packets to someone, and they might only get 95 of those packets, and some might be in the wrong order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For things like video streaming, and multiplayer gaming, where it is better to miss a packet than to delay all the other packets behind it, this is the obvious choice&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most other things though, a missing or 'rearranged' packet is critical. You'd have to write some extra code to run on top of UDP to retry if things got missed, and enforce correct order. This would add a small bit of overhead in certain places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, some very very smart people have done this, and they called it TCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of it this way: If a packet goes missing, would you rather just get the next packet as quickly as possible and continue (use UDP), or do you actually need that missing data (use TCP). The overhead won't matter unless you're in a really edge-case scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Browsers do all sort of tricks to try and minimize the bandwith and there are many ways in the HTTP protocol to do that, all of which are dealt with by apache - if you are just serving a local file. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not, then &lt;strong&gt;it's your responsibility&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a look at least at the ETag and the If-Modified-Since mechanics which are supported by all current browsers and seem to be the most robust way to query the server for updated content. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A possible way to serve a CSS file to browsers using the If-Modified-Since-Header is something like this (the empty headers to turn off any non-caching headers PHP sends per default):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$p = 'path/to/css/file'
$i = stat($p);
if ($_SERVER['HTTP_IF_MODIFIED_SINCE']){
    $imd = strtotime($_SERVER['HTTP_IF_MODIFIED_SINCE']);
    if ( ($imd &amp;gt; 0) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ($imd &amp;gt;= $i['mtime'])){
        header('HTTP/1.0 304 Not Modified');
        header('Expires:');
        header('Cache-Control:');
        header('Last-Modified: '.date('r', $i['mtime']));
        exit;
    }
}
header('Last-Modified: '.date('r', $i['mtime']));
header('Content-Type: text/css');
header('Content-Length: '.filesize($p));
header('Cache-Control:');
header('Pragma:');
header('Expires:');
readfile($p);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code will use the if-modified-since-header the browser sends to check if the actual file on the server has changed since the date the browser has given. If so, the file is sent, otherwise, a 304 Not Modified is returned and the browser does not have to re-download the whole content (and if it's intelligent enough, it keeps the parsed CSS around in memory too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another mechanic involving the server sending a unique ETag-Header for each piece of content. The Client will send that back using an  If-None-Match header allowing the server to decide not only on the date of last modification but also on the content itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This just makes the code more complicated though, so I have left it out. FF, IE and Opera (probably Safari too) all send the If-Modified-Since header when they receive content with a Last-Modified header attached, so this works fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also keep in mind that certain versions of IE (or the JScript-Runtime it uses) &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; have problems with GZIP-transferred content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh. And I know that's not part of the question, but so does Acrobat in some versions. I've had cases and cases of white screens while serving PDFs with gzip transfer encoding.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Notes to Inheritors:&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The Message property is overridden in classes that require control over message content or format. Application code typically accesses this property when it needs to display information about an exception that has been caught.&lt;/p&gt;

If I understand correctly, you have a both a web app (read/write) a standalone application (read-only?) using Hibernate to access a shared database. The changes you make with the web app aren't visible to the standalone app. Is that right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If so, have you considered using a different second-level cache implementation? I'm wondering if you might be able to use a clustered cache that is shared by both the web application and the standalone application. I believe that SwarmCache, which is integrated with Hibernate, will allow this, but I haven't tried it myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, though, you should know that the contents of a given cache will never be aware of activity by another application (that's why I suggest having both apps share a cache). Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think an important question to ask is what exactly is the exception message for?  It is not for knowing where the exception came from, the stack trace is for that; it is not to encapsulate an exception in a more general one, that should be done with the InnerException field; in the case where your exception is only raised from a particular place in your code it isn't even for describing what kind of error you had - thats what the type of the exception is for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally I use the message field to provide simple, human-readable tips that a programmer that is not me, seeing this error for the first time can use to gain an understanding of the underlying system.  I consider the message field to be appropriate for a short (one sentence) explanation, a hint as to how this error is frequently raised, or a reference to further reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as far as I understand your question, I think that the best way to store this 'additional information' that is received from another system is as an InnerException.  I don't know Elmah, but if it's worth its salt it will check for InnerExceptions and store them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Static methods should deal entirely with abstract properties and concepts of a class - they should in no way relate to instance specific attributes (and most compilers will yell if they do).&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the car example, speed, kms driven are clearly attribute related. Gear shifting and speed calculation, when considered at the car level, are attribute dependent - but consider a carModel class that inherits from car: at this point theyy could become static methods, as the required attributes (such as wheel diameter) could be defined as constants at that level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to determine if a user has disconnected (stop button, closed browser, etc.) the server must attempt to send a packet.  If the TCP/IP connection has been closed, an &lt;code&gt;IOException&lt;/code&gt; will be thrown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, a Java application could send a space character at various points during processing.  An &lt;code&gt;IOException&lt;/code&gt; would signal that the client has gone away and processing can be aborted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there may be a few issues with this technique:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sending characters during processing will cause the response to be "committed", so it may be impossible to set HTTP headers, cookies, etc. based on the result of the long-running serverside processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the output stream is buffered, the space characters will not be sent immediately, thereby not performing an adequate test.  It may be possible to use &lt;code&gt;flush()&lt;/code&gt; as a workaround.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be difficult to implement this technique for a given framework or view technology (JSP, etc.)  For example, the page rendering code will not be able to sent the content type after the response has been committed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

     }
     return instance;
   }
   public synchronized void increment(){
        count++;
   }

   public synchronized void decrement(){
        count--;
        if( count&amp;lt;0 ) {
            count=0;
        }
   }

   public synchronized boolean isClear(){
         return count==0;    

    }
   }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state is in ONLY in the instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the singleton can be modified later to do pooling, thread-local instances etc.
And none of the already written code needs to change to get the benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public static class LessUgly {
       private static Hashtable&amp;lt;String,LessUgly&amp;gt; session;
       private static FIFO&amp;lt;LessUgly&amp;gt; freePool = new FIFO&amp;lt;LessUgly&amp;gt;();
       private static final POOL_SIZE=5;
       private int count;

       private LessUgly(){
       }

       public static synchronized getInstance(){
         if( session==null){
            session = new Hashtable&amp;lt;String,LessUgly&amp;gt;(POOL_SIZE);
            for( int i=0; i &amp;lt; POOL_SIZE; i++){
               LessUgly instance = new LessUgly();  
               freePool.add( instance)
            }
         }
         LessUgly instance = session.get( Session.getSessionID());
         if( instance == null){
            instance = freePool.read();
         }
         if( instance==null){
             // TODO search sessions for expired ones. Return spares to the freePool. 
             //FIXME took too long to write example in blog editor.
         }
         return instance;
       }     
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's possible to do something similar with a static class but there will be per-call overhead in the indirect dispatch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get the instance and pass it to a function as an argument. This lets code be directed to the  "right" singleton. We know you'll only need one of it... until you don't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big benefit is that stateful singletons can be made thread safe, whereas a static class cannot, unless you modify it to be a secret singleton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cross-platform compatibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20050808-5183.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ajax&lt;/a&gt; works in &lt;a href="http://www.musingsfrommars.org/2006/03/ajax-dhtml-library-scorecard.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;any modern browser&lt;/a&gt; that can run &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" rel="nofollow"&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;. Flex requires Flash or anything else that can handle &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWF" rel="nofollow"&gt;SWF&lt;/a&gt;s but, once that's installed, it's a &lt;a href="http://blog.arc90.com/2006/07/10_reasons_we_love_flex_2.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;total freeride&lt;/a&gt; as far as compatibility. Silverlight is &lt;a href="http://wildermuth.com/2008/04/03/Silverlight_Compatibility_Confusion" rel="nofollow"&gt;tricky and misunderstood&lt;/a&gt; so carefully consider your &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverlight#Compatibility" rel="nofollow"&gt;userbase&lt;/a&gt; before going with this MS foray into the rich web applications arms race. Also keep in mind that Silverlight is still in Beta, so it may become more widely used and installed in the future as it is developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Performance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm fearful of making too many statements about performance because it really depends on how much you are willing to optimize and the exact nature of your application. Also, some technology stacks are just never going to be very fast. &lt;a href="http://www.jamesward.com/wordpress/2007/04/30/ajax-and-flex-data-loading-benchmarks/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Some people out there have been making comparisons&lt;/a&gt;, but again, &lt;a href="http://metalinkltd.com/?p=108" rel="nofollow"&gt;it depends on a great many factors&lt;/a&gt; (even the version of the browser from which you are testing!). It's probably best to choose based on other factors and optimize once you've started to develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Developer tools&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are the "golden standard" dev tools for each of the three:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ajax has basically unlimited options, depending on the rest of your technology and architecture choices. The big questions you're actually faced with are which libraries to rely upon, and Google has voiced a pretty well adopted answer with things like &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Web Toolkit&lt;/a&gt;. When you get right down to it, it's just XML and JavaScript, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flex is from Adobe and, just like with Flash development, you'd better stick with &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/flexdownloads/index.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;their homegrown tools&lt;/a&gt; because--well--they're making the standards as they go along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has positioned Microsoft Expression Blend versions 2.0 and 2.5 for designing the UI of Silverlight 1.0 and 2 applications respectively. Visual Studio 2008 can be used to develop and debug Silverlight applications (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverlight#Development_tools" rel="nofollow"&gt;from Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Community support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is both official and unofficial community, corporate, and open-source support for all three options. Whichever you are already integrated with and which makes you feel most at home are very individual things, but I'll offer this advice: stick with what you know. If you are a MS developer and have MSDN as your homepage, you are probably going to think the &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=1840cab5-196c-4264-b55d-562242a72625&amp;amp;displaylang=en" rel="nofollow"&gt;Silverlight documentation&lt;/a&gt; and forums are really helpful. Flex has a very similar story; the forums are pretty good and if you're a Flash person already, you're going to be right at home with their &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/documentation/en/flex/" rel="nofollow"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/" rel="nofollow"&gt;user community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Ajax is basically all over the place because you can implement so many different ways and use so many widely-varied libraries. Each library can have it's own forums to visit and mailing lists to lurk within for answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, all three have corporate giants trying to foster their communities and to get the best support possible to the developers that will give them greater market share in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ubiquity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ajax -- Supported by all modern browsers across platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flex -- Runtime (Flash Player) has very wide installed base for Windows, Mac OS, Linux. Linux version was a bit buggy the last time I checked, though&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silverlight -- Runtime has quite low installed base (and no Linux support) at the moment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choice of programming language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Unordeded because of subjectivity, but note that Silverlight offers the most choice. Also note that the existing language experience of developers in your team should be taken into account.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silverlight: Any .NET language (C#, Visual Basic, IronPython(?), IronRuby(?)) (and XAML for UI definition)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ajax: JavaScript (and XHTML for UI definition)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flex: ActionScript 3 (and MXML for UI definition)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;API Stability and compatibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flex -- Runtime is the same across platforms and browsers, more mature and stable at the moment than Silverlight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silverlight -- Runtime is the same across platforms and browsers, less mature than Flex/Flash, v2.0 is still in beta&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ajax -- Compatibility problems across browsers (may be mitigated via Ajax libraries, though)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web/Browser Integration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ajax -- Content is native inside browser, based on standards: searchable by browser and search engine crawlers, subject to any standard UI practices the browser and operating system have established&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flex and Silverlight -- Content not native to browser (i.e. runs in its own little "sandbox/rectangle"): not necessarily subject to established UI practices for the given platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developer Tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ajax -- Your favorite code editor, browser and debugging toolkit for the browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flex -- Flex SDK is available for Windows, Mac OS and Linux for free and can be used with your favorite code editor. A Command-line debugger is included, but the Adobe-provided profiler is only available in the commercial Flex Builder IDE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silverlight -- &lt;em&gt;AFAIK&lt;/em&gt;, The SDK is available for Windows for free and can be used with your favorite .NET development tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why Use Nested Classes?
There are several compelling reasons for using nested classes, among them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a way of logically grouping classes that are only used in one place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It increases encapsulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nested classes can lead to more readable and maintainable code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logical grouping of classesIf a class is useful to only one other class, then it is logical to embed it in that class and keep the two together. Nesting such "helper classes" makes their package more streamlined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;s&gt;Increased encapsulationConsider two top-level classes, A and B, where B needs access to members of A that would otherwise be declared private. By hiding class B within class A, A's members can be declared private and B can access them. In addition, B itself can be hidden from the outside world.&lt;/s&gt; &amp;lt;- This doesn't apply to C#'s implementation of nested classes, this only applies to Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More readable, maintainable codeNesting small classes within top-level classes places the code closer to where it is used. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can you tell when packets arrive, and how big the packet is, do you have to do all the heavy lifting yourself?

For instance, in the past when sending variable length binary data, I would put an int at the beginning that said how many bytes to expect.  I'd do a read requesting a number of bytes greater than the largest possible packet in my protocol, and then I'd compare the first int against however many bytes I'd received, and either process it or try more reads until I'd gotten the full packet, depending.&lt;/p&gt;

In other cases this means wrapping the third-party library in some API that you come up with.  &lt;/p&gt;

You can be notified that there is data available to be read, but you won't know how many bytes are available.  In most IP protocols that use variable length packets, there will be a header with a known fixed length prepended to the packet.  This header will contain the length of the packet.  You read the header, get the length of the packet, then read the packet.  You repeat this pattern (read header, then read packet) until communication is complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When reading data from a socket, you request a certain number of bytes.  The read call may block until the requested number of bytes are read, but it can return fewer bytes than what was requested.  When this happens, you simply retry the read, requesting the remaining bytes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a typical C function for reading a set number of bytes from a socket:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/* buffer points to memory block that is bigger than the number of bytes to be read */
/* socket is open socket that is connected to a sender */
/* bytesToRead is the number of bytes expected from the sender */
/* bytesRead is a pointer to a integer variable that will hold the number of bytes */
/*           actually received from the sender. */
/* The function returns either the number of bytes read, */
/*                             0 if the socket was closed by the sender, and */
/*                            -1 if an error occurred while reading from the socket */
int readBytes(int socket, char *buffer, int bytesToRead, int *bytesRead)
{
    *bytesRead = 0;
    while(*bytesRead &amp;lt; bytesToRead)
    {
        int ret = read(socket, buffer + *bytesRead, bytesToRead - *bytesRead);
        if(ret &amp;lt;= 0)
        {
           /* either connection was closed or an error occurred */
           return ret;
        }
        else
        {
           *bytesRead += ret;
        }
    }
    return *bytesRead;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

I'm now writing a module which needs to temporarily set new hover behavior for some elements. The new module has no access to the original code for the hover functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to store the old hover functions before I set new ones so I can restore them when finished with the temporary hover behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think these can be stored using the jquery.data() function:&lt;/p&gt;

$('#foo').data('oldhoverin',???)

$('#foo').data('oldhoverout',???);

$('#foo').hover(newhoverin,newhoverout);

Thanks for the suggestion, and for helping clarify what I'm searching for. Maybe I have to go into the source of jquery and figure out how these callbacks are stored internally. Maybe I should change the question to "Is it possible to do this without modifying jquery?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;STAThread()&amp;gt; Public Shared Sub Main()

    splash = New frmSplash
    splash.Show()

    ' Your startup code goes here...

    UpdateSplashAndLogMessage("Startup part 1 done...")

    ' ... and more as needed...

    splash.Hide()
    Application.Run(myMainForm)
End Sub
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the .NET CLR starts your application, it creates a 'main' thread and starts executing your main() on that thread. The Application.Run(myMainForm) at the end does two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starts the Windows 'message pump', using the thread that has been executing main() as the GUI thread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designates your 'main form' as the 'shutdown form' for the application. If the user closes that form, then the Application.Run() terminates and control returns to your main(), where you can do any shutdown you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no need to spawn a thread to take care of the splash window, and in fact this is a bad idea, because then you would have to use thread-safe techniques to update the splash contents from main().&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need other threads to do background operations in your application, you can spawn them from main(). Just remember to set Thread.IsBackground to True, so that they will die when the main / GUI thread terminates. Otherwise you will have to arrange to terminate all your other threads yourself, or they will keep your application alive (but with no GUI) when the main thread terminates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Darn my dyslexia (by which I mean careless reading).  For some reason I've always read "descriptor" as "decorator" and vice versa, even when I'm the one typing both of them.  I'll leave my post intact since it has valid information, albeit information which has absolutely nothing to do with the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term "decorator" itself is actually the name of a design pattern described in the famous "Design Patterns" book.  The Wikipedia article contains many examples in different programming languages of decorator usage: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the decorators in that article object-oriented; they have classes implementing a predefined interface which lets another existing class behave differently somehow, etc.  Python decorators act in a functional way by replacing a function at runtime with another function, allowing you to effectively modify/replace that function, insert code, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is known in the Java world as Aspect-Oriented programming, and the AspectJ Java compiler lets you do these kinds of things and compile your AspectJ code (which is a superset of Java) into Java bytecode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not familiar enough with C# or Ruby to know what their version of decorators would be.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, I use Subsonic for my data access, Devexpress components for UI and Peter Blum Data Entry Suite for data entry and validation.  Subsonic is open source, Devexpress Peter Blum's controls have source code available for an extra fee. It would be impossible for me to get the functionality of these control if I tried to write them myself.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach allows me to focus on the custom functionality of my application without having to worry about how I will access the database or how I make an editable treelist that looks pretty.  Sure I don't have a fully configured and working forum but I know that I'll be using a SQL database for my app and I won't have to try and get different data storage components to work together. I don't have a wiki but I know how to use the devexpress ui components and formatting and validating data entry is breeze with Peter Blum's controls.  In other words, learn tools (and of course choose them carefully) that will speed development of all of your projects then you can focus on portions of your application that have to be customized.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not too concerned if it's open source or not as long as source code is available. If it's open source I donate to the project. If it's a commercial component I will pay a fair price. In any case, the tools help to make programming fun and the results have data integrity and are great looking. If I develop a wiki or forum I know that I can get them to work together seamlesslessly.  Finally, all of the tools I have mentioned have been around for a long time and are written by outstanding developers with great reputations.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The basic premise would be to show your splash on a separate thread as soon as possible.  That's the way I would lean, similar to what aku's illustrated, since it's the way I'm most familiar with.  I was not aware of the VB function Guy mentioned.  And, even thought it's a &lt;em&gt;VB&lt;/em&gt; library, he is right -- it's all IL in the end.  So, even if it feels &lt;em&gt;dirty&lt;/em&gt; it's not all that bad!  :)  I think you'll want to be sure that either VB provides a separate thread for in that override or that you create one yourself -- definitely research that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming you create another thread to display this splash, you will want to be careful of cross thread UI updates.  I bring this up because you mentioned updating progress.  Basically, to be safe, you need to call an update function (that you create) on the splash form using a delegate.  You pass that delegate to the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zyzhdc6b.aspx"&gt;Invoke&lt;/a&gt; function on your splash screen's form object.  In fact if you call the splash form directly to update progress/UI elements on it, you'll get an exception provided you are running on the .Net 2.0 CLR.  As a rule of thumb, any UI element on a form must be updated by the thread that created it -- that's what Form.Invoke insures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I would likely opt to create the splash (if not using the VB overload) in the main method of your code.  To me this is better than having the main form perform creation of the object and to be so tightly bound to it.  If you take that approach, I'd suggest creating a simple interface that the splash screen implements -- something like IStartupProgressListener -- which receives start-up progress updates via a member function.  This will allow you to easily swap in/out either class as needed, and nicely decouples the code.  The splash form can also know when to close itself if you notify when start-up is complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; keyword on a function declaration indicates to the compiler that the function is contractually obligated not to modify the state of A. Thus you are unable to call non-&lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; functions within &lt;em&gt;Foo()&lt;/em&gt; nor change the value of member variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;mutable&lt;/code&gt; keyword instructs the compiler to accept modifications to the member variable which would otherwise cause a compiler error. It is used when the function needs to modify state but the object is considered logically consistent (constant) regardless of the modification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typed constants, on the other hand, can be structured values - arrays and records. These guys need actual storage in the executable - i.e. they need to have storage allocated for them such that, when the OS loads the executable, the value of the typed constant is physically contained at some location in memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explain why, historically, typed constants in early Delphi and its predecessor, Turbo Pascal, are writable (and thus essentially initialized global variables), we need to go back to the days of DOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DOS runs in real-mode, in x86 terms. This means that programs have direct access to physical memory without any &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit"&gt;MMU&lt;/a&gt; doing virtual-physical mappings. When programs have direct access to memory, no memory protection is in effect. In other words, if there is memory at any given address, it is both readable and writable in real-mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in a Turbo Pascal program for DOS with a typed constant, whose value is allocated at an address in memory at runtime, that typed constant will be writable. There is no hardware MMU getting in the way and preventing the program from writing to it. Similarly, because Pascal has no notion of 'const'ness that C++ has, there is nothing in the type system to stop you. A lot of people took advantage of this, since Turbo Pascal and Delphi did not at that time have initialized global variables as a feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on to Windows, there is a layer between memory addresses and physical addresses: the memory management unit. This chip takes the page index (a shifted mask) of the memory address you're trying to access, and looks up the attributes of this page in its &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_table"&gt;page table&lt;/a&gt;. These attributes include readable, writable, and for modern x86 chips, non-executable flags. With this support, it's possible to mark sections of the .EXE or .DLL with attributes such that when the Windows loader loads the executable image into memory, it assigns appropriate page attributes for memory pages that map to disk pages within these sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the 32-bit Windows version of the Delphi compiler came around, it thus made sense to make const-like things &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; const, as the OS also has this feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least from the demos I saw recently, it looks like ADO.Net Data Services is built on WCF stack on the server. Please correct me if I am wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not intending to start a REST vs SOAP debate but I guess things are not that crystal clear anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions or guidelines on what to use where? &lt;/p&gt;

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, this function overflows and returns a really large negative value.  To try and track down exactly where this was happening, I added a cout statement so that the function looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;float function(){
    float x = SomeValue;
    cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; x;

&lt;p&gt;(If it's any help, the value stored in the float is just an integer value, and not a particularly big one.  I just put it in a float to avoid casting.)&lt;/p&gt;

    assumed.  For each element in WORDS, NAME is set to that element, and

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for w in word1 word2 word3
do
  doSomething($w)
done
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably you want to iterate along some numbers, so you can use the &lt;code&gt;seq&lt;/code&gt; command to generate a list of numbers for you: (from 1 to 100 for example)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;seq 1 100
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and use it in the FOR loop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for n in $(seq 1 100)
do
  doSomething($n)
done
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the &lt;code&gt;$(...)&lt;/code&gt; syntax. It's a bash behaviour, it allows you to pass the output from one command (in our case from &lt;code&gt;seq&lt;/code&gt;) to another (the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is really useful when you have to iterate over all directories in some path, for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're going to be using a lot of advanced UI controls like trees, lists, tab controls, etc then consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;JavaScript/HTML - No native support for anything beyond things basic drop down boxes, buttons, and text fields.  If you want something like a tree control or tab control then you'll have to roll your own or find a third party library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adobe ActionScript - Native support for a wide array of advanced UI controls&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silverlight - 1.0 had very limited UI controls, but 2.0 will be adding many more and I'm sure we'll continue to see controls added in future releases.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This happens because of the difference between the IEEE spec and the hardware the code is running on.  Your CPU likely has 80 bit floating point registers that get use to hold the 32-bit float value. This means that there is far more precision while the value stays in a register than when it is forced to a memory address (also known as 'homing' the register).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you passed the value to cout the compiler had to write the floating point to memory, and this results in a lost of precision and interesting behaviour WRT overflow cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the MSDN documentation on VC++ &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e7s85ffb(VS.80).aspx"&gt;floating point switches&lt;/a&gt;.  You could try compiling with /fp:strict and seeing what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For UDP, life gets a lot simpler, in that you can call recv/recvfrom/recvmsg with the packet size you need (you'd likely send fixed-length packets from the source anyway), and make the assumption that if data is available, it's there in multiples of packet-length sizes. (I.E. You call recv* with the size of your sending side packet, and you're set.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For TCP, life gets a bit more interesting - for the purpose of this explanation, I will assume that you already know how to use socket(), bind(), listen() and accept() - the latter being how you get the file descriptor (FD) of your newly made connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways of doing the I/O for a socket - blocking, in which you call read(fd, buf, N) and the read sits there and waits until you've read N bytes into buf - or non-blocking, in which you have to check (using select() or poll()) whether the FD is readable, and THEN do your read().&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When dealing with TCP-based connections, the OS doesn't pay attention to the packet sizes, since it's considered a continual stream of data, not seperate packet-sized chunks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your application uses "packets" (packed or unpacked data structures that you're passing around), you ought to be able to call read() with the proper size argument, and read an entire data structure off the socket at a time. The only caveat you have to deal with, is to remember to properly byte-order any data that you're sending, in case the source and destination system are of different byte endian-ness. This applies to both UDP and TCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as *NIX socket programming is concerned, I highly recommend W. Richard Stevens' "Unix Network Programming, Vol. 1" (UNPv1) and "Advanced Programming in an Unix Environment" (APUE). The first is a tome regarding network-based programming, regardless of the transport, and the latter is a good all-around programming book as it applies to *NIX based programming. Also, look for "TCP/IP Illustrated", Volumes 1 and 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these products have a handy feature which produces sample XML files based on your schema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Oracle's JDeveloper (based on Borland Jbuilder, I believe) tries to provide a decent schema editor, but falls short in that it sometimes produces invalid schema files.  I stopped using it soon after noticing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend checking out IBM's &lt;a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xmlsqc" rel="nofollow"&gt;XML Schema Quality Checker&lt;/a&gt;.  This command line tool validates your schema against WC3's XML Schema language.  This is a good idea even if you've built your schema using another tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is that DAOs should only be responsible for holding properties of the real world objects they are modeling, and only have getter and setter methods (or just direct property access).  This makes serializing the DAOs to a file, or creating methods for a generic compare / generic copy easier to write, as the code wouldn't contain a whole bunch of "if" statements to skip these helper methods. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This just leaves option 3, which most would agree to be correct behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Option 3 has a few advantages, with the biggest advantage being unit testing.  This is because both Needle and Haystack objects can be easily mocked up now, whereas if option 1 or 2 were used, the internal state of either Needle or Haystack would have to be modified before a search could be performed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, with the searcher now in a separate class, all search code can be held in one place, including common search code.  Whereas if the search code was put into the DAO, common search code would either be stored in a complicated class hierarchy, or with a Searcher Helper class anyway.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I am aware of the store password functionality in browsers, but my scripts go a step further by checking if I'm logged into the site when it loads (by traversing HTML) and then submitting a post to the login page.  This removes the step of having to load up the site, entering the login page, entering my credentials, then hitting submit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using it for RPC style services seems like a bad fit, though unfortunately even some very basic features like being able to perform a filtered counts etc. aren't available which often means you'll end up using some RPC just to meet the requirements of your customers i.e. so you can display a paged grid etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WCF 3.5 pre-SP1 was a fairly weak RESTful platform, with SP1 things have improved in both Uri templates and with the availability of ATOMPub support, such that it's becoming more capable, but they don't really provide any elegant solution for supporting say JSON, XML, ATOM or even something more esoteric like payload like CSV simultaneously, short of having to make use of URL rewriting and different extension, method name munging etc. - rather then just selecting a serializer/deserializer based on the headers of the request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With WCF it's still difficult to create services that work in a more a natural restful manor i.e. where resources include urls, and you can transition state by navigating through them - it's a little clunky - ADO.Net data services does this quite well with it's AtomPub support though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My recommendation would be use web services where they're naturally are services and strong service boundaries being enforced, use ADO.Net Data services for rich web-style clients (websites, ajax, silverlight) where the composability of the url queries can save a lot of plumbing and your domain model is pretty basic... and roll your own REST layer (perhaps using an MVC framework as a starting point) if you need complete control over the information i.e. if you're publishing an API for other developers to consume on a social platform etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My 2 worth!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;try

    remoteKey = RegistryKey.OpenRemoteBaseKey(

    UnauthorizedAccessException myexception = e;
    //Console.WriteLine("{0}: {1}: {2}",
    //    e.GetType().Name, e.Message, addr.Value);

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This entire bit of code was designed before anyone had thought you might not use your local logon for everything. I can't work out how you do authentication for remotely connecting to the registry, anyway, and this code looks like it's only used in one case, when it can't get this information from WMI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

This is really not something that you would want to do. You would have to have multiple 'header' files to import depending on the content and where you want to use the tag. Maintenance nightmare.

public ActionResult EmptyID()

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;News.mvc/Archive/2008

&lt;p&gt;I have a form on this page like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;form&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;select name="year"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;option value="2007"&amp;gt;2007&amp;lt;/option&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/select&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submitting the form should go to News.mvc/Archive/2007 if '2007' is selected in the form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This requires the form 'action' attribute to be "News.mvc/Archive".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if I declare a form like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;form method="get" action="&amp;lt;%=Url.RouteUrl("News-Archive")%&amp;gt;"&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it renders as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;form method="get" action="/News.mvc/Archive/2008"&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, your route doesn't have a default value for "year", so the URL "/News.mvc/Archive" is actually not valid for routing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, you're expect form values to show up as route parameters, but that's not how HTML works. If you use a plain form with a select and a submit, your URLs will end up having "?year=2007" on the end of them. This is just how GET-method forms are designed to work in HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you need to come to some conclusion about what's important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want the user to be able to select something from the dropdown and that changes the submission URL, then you're going to have to use Javascript to achieve this (by intercepting the form submit and formulating the correct URL).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're okay with /News.mvc/Archive?year=2007 as your URL, then you should remove the {year} designator from the route entirely. You can still leave the "int year" parameter on your action, since form values will also populate action method parameters.&lt;/li&gt;

I've been using Sleep() calls to coordinate the order of the calls from the different threads, but that's not really reliable. It's also a lot slower because you have to sleep long enough that the timing usually works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/multithreadedtc/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Multithreaded TC Java library&lt;/a&gt; from the same group that wrote FindBugs. It lets you specify the order of events without using Sleep(), and it's reliable. I haven't tried it yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest limitation to this approach is that it only lets you test the scenarios you suspect will cause trouble. As others have said, you really need to isolate your multithreaded code into a small number of simple classes to have any hope of thoroughly testing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you've carefully tested the scenarios you expect to cause trouble, an unscientific test that throws a bunch of simultaneous requests at the class for a while is a good way to look for unexpected trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

This application uses the Win32 CryptoAPI to generate a TripleDES session key for encrypting/decrypting data. We're using the &lt;a href="http://www.phdcc.com/cryptorc4.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;exponent of one trick&lt;/a&gt; to export the session key out as a blob, which allows the blob to be stored somewhere in a decrypted format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is how can we use this in our .NET application (C#). The framework encapsulates/wraps much of what the CryptoAPI is doing. Part of the problem is the CryptAPI states that the TripleDES algorithm for the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa386986(VS.85).aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider&lt;/a&gt; is 168 bits (3 keys of 56 bits). However, the .NET framework states their keys are 192 bits (3 keys of 64 bits). Apparently, the 3 extra bytes in the .NET framework is for parity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we need to read the key portion out of the blob and somehow be able to use that in our .NET application. Currently we are not getting the expected results when attempting to use the key in .NET. The decryption is failing miserably. Any help would be greatly appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;list&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; maps directly to an
IList.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;bag&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; maps to an IList. A  does not completely comply
with the IList interface because the
Add() method is not guaranteed to
return the correct index. An object
can be added to a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;bag&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; without
initializing the IList. Make sure to
either hide the IList from the
consumers of your API or make it
well documented.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;set&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; maps to an Iesi.Collections.ISet. That
interface is part of the
Iesi.Collections assembly
distributed with NHibernate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so if you want an IList to be returned, then you would use the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;list&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; mapping. In your case, I'd probably map using the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;list&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; mapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay here is the solution, (thanks to Brad for leading me there).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Require default value in route:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;routes.MapRoute(
       "News-Archive",                                              
       "News.mvc/Archive/{year}",                           
       new { controller = "News", action = "Archive", year = 0 }
   );
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Add a redirect to parse GET parameters as though they are URL segments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public ActionResult Archive(int year)
{
   if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(Request["year"]))
   {
       return RedirectToAction("Archive", new { year = Request["year"] });
   }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Make sure you have your redirect code for Request params &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; any code for redirecting "default" year entries.  i.e.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public ActionResult Archive(int year)
{
   if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(Request["year"]))
   {
       return RedirectToAction("Archive", new { year = Request["year"] });
   }
   if (year == 0)
   {
       /* ... */
   }
   /* ... */
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Explicitly specify the default value for year in the Url.RouteUrl() call:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Url.RouteUrl("News-Archive", new { year = 0 })
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to create identifiers that are not valid in your language is not a good idea. If you really want to set variables like that, use attribute macros:&lt;/p&gt;

  end
end

s = SillySetter.new
s.foo = 5              # -&amp;gt; setting foo= 5
s.foo.bar.baz = 4      # -&amp;gt; setting foo.bar.baz= 4

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.hoozi.com/Articles/AESEncryption.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;algorithm&lt;/a&gt; is simple. The Sun Java website has a &lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Security/AES/AES_v1.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;section explaining how to do AES&lt;/a&gt; encryption in Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Wikipedia...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;... the Advanced
  Encryption Standard (AES), also known
  as Rijndael, is a block cipher adopted
  as an encryption standard by the U.S.
  government. It has been analyzed
  extensively and is now used worldwide,
  as was the case with its
  predecessor, the Data Encryption
  Standard (DES)...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as a rule of thumb you are not supposed to use DES or its variants because it is being phased out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of now, it is better to use AES. There are other options like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twofish" rel="nofollow"&gt;Twofish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)" rel="nofollow"&gt;Blowfish&lt;/a&gt; etc also. Note that Twofish can be considered as an advanced version of Blowfish.&lt;/p&gt;

Currently, we are using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. The algorithm often returns a lot of false-positives (if we set the minimum-score too low), sometimes it doesn't find a match when it should (when the minimum-score is too high) and, most of the times, we need to check the results by hand. We thought we should try other alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have any experiences with the algorithms?
Do you know how the algorithms compare to one another?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd really appreciate some advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, I'm sorry I forgot to mention that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, we're not using it to match duplicate data. We have a list of strings that we are looking for - we call it search-list. And then we need to process texts from various sources (like RSS feeds, web-sites, forums, etc.) - we extract parts of those texts (there are entire sets of rules for that, but that's irrelevant) and we need to match those against the search-list. If the string matches one of the strings in search-list - we need to do some further processing of the thing (which is also irrelevant).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can not perform the normal comparison, because the strings extracted from the outside sources, most of the times, include some extra words etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it's not for duplicate detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a page that pulls dynamic content from a javabean and passes the list of objects to a custom tag for processing into html. Within each object is a bunch of html to be output that contains a second custom tag that I would like to also be rendered. The problem is that the tag invocation is rendered as plaintext.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example might serve me better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 Pull information from a database and return it to the page via a javabean. Send this info to a custom tag for outputting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;jsp:useBean id="ImportantNoticeBean" scope="page" class="com.mysite.beans.ImportantNoticeProcessBean"/&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;%-- Declare the bean --%&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;c:forEach var="noticeBean" items="${ImportantNoticeBean.importantNotices}"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;%-- Get the info --%&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;mysite:notice importantNotice="${noticeBean}"/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;%-- give it to the tag for processing --%&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/c:forEach&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this tag should output a box div like so&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*SNIP* class for custom tag def and method setup etc
out.println("&amp;lt;div class=\"importantNotice\"&amp;gt;");
out.println("   " + importantNotice.getMessage());
out.println("   &amp;lt;div class=\"importantnoticedates\"&amp;gt;Posted: " + importantNotice.getDateFrom() + " End: " + importantNotice.getDateTo()&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;");
out.println("   &amp;lt;div class=\"noticeAuthor\"&amp;gt;- " + importantNotice.getAuthor() + "&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;");
out.println("&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;");
*SNIP*
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This renders fine and as expected&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class="importantNotice"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a very important message. Everyone should pay attenton to it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class="importantnoticedates"&amp;gt;Posted: 2008-09-08 End: 2008-09-08&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class="noticeAuthor"&amp;gt;- The author&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 If, in the above example, for instance, I were to have a custom tag in the importantNotice.getMessage() String:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*SNIP* "This is a very important message. Everyone should pay attenton to it. &amp;lt;mysite:quote author="Some Guy"&amp;gt;Quote this&amp;lt;/mysite:quote&amp;gt;" *SNIP*
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important notice renders fine but the quote tag will not be processed and simply inserted into the string and put as plain text/html tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class="importantNotice"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a very important message. Everyone should pay attenton to it. &amp;lt;mysite:quote author="Some Guy"&amp;gt;Quote this&amp;lt;/mysite:quote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class="importantnoticedates"&amp;gt;Posted: 2008-09-08 End: 2008-09-08&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class="noticeAuthor"&amp;gt;- The author&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class="importantNotice"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a very important message. Everyone should pay attenton to it. &amp;lt;div class="quote"&amp;gt;Quote this &amp;lt;span class="authorofquote"&amp;gt;Some Guy&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;    // or wahtever I choose as the output
    &amp;lt;div class="importantnoticedates"&amp;gt;Posted: 2008-09-08 End: 2008-09-08&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class="noticeAuthor"&amp;gt;- The author&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this has to do with processors and pre-processors but I am not to sure about how to make this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in answer by &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/49274/safe-integer-parsing-in-ruby/53359#53359"&gt;Joseph Pecoraro&lt;/a&gt;, you might want to watch for strings that are valid non-decimal numbers, such as those starting with &lt;code&gt;0x&lt;/code&gt; for hex and &lt;code&gt;0b&lt;/code&gt; for binary, and potentially more tricky numbers starting with zero that will be parsed as octal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby 1.9.2 added optional second argument for radix so above issue can be avoided:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Integer('23')                                     # =&amp;gt; 23
Integer('0x23')                                   # =&amp;gt; 35
Integer('023')                                    # =&amp;gt; 19
Integer('0x23', 10)
# =&amp;gt; #&amp;lt;ArgumentError: invalid value for Integer: "0x23"&amp;gt;
Integer('023', 10)                                # =&amp;gt; 23
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is for a corporate environment, of course all their accounts are setup this way. Weird thing is, that in the download dialog, the Content-Type is not recognized:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;header( 'Pragma: public' );

&lt;p&gt;It is, however, useful to understand what is difficult about learning C, which might help you understand what's making it difficult for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd say the things that would prove difficult in C for someone coming from PHP would be :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pointers and memory management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is pretty much the reason you're learning C I imagine, so there's not really any getting around it. Learning lower level assembly type languages might make this easier, but C is probably a bridge to do that, not the other way around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of builtin data structures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; PHP and co all have native String types, and useful things like hash tables built in, which is not the case in C. In C, a String is just an array of characters, which means you'll need to do a lot more work, or look seriously at libraries which add the features you're used to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of builtin libraries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Languages like PHP now days almost always come with stacks of libraries for things like database connections, image manipulation and stacks of other things. In C, this is not the case other than a very thin standard library which revolves mostly around file reading, writing and basic string manipulation. There are almost always good choices available to fill these needs, but you need to include them yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suitability for high level tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you try to implement the same type of application in C as you might in PHP, you'll find it very slow going. Generating a web page, for example, isn't really something plain C is suited for, so if you're trying to do that, ou'll find it very slow going.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preprocessor and compilation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Most languages these days don't have a preprocessor, and if you're coming from PHP, the compilation cycle will seem painful. Both of these are performance trade offs in a way - Scripting languages make the trade off in terms of developer efficiency, where as C prefers performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sure there are more that aren't springing to mind for me right now. The moral of the story is that trying to understand what you're finding difficult in C may help you proceed. If you're trying to generate web pages with it, try doing something lower level. If you're missing hash tables, try writing your own, or find a library. If you're struggling with pointers, stick with it :)&lt;/p&gt;

I'll refer you to &lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/effective/"&gt;Josh Bloch in Effective Java&lt;/a&gt;, who writes (item 16) why to prefer the use of interfaces over abstract classes. By the way, if you haven't got this book, I highly recommend it! Here is a summary of what he says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Existing classes can be easily retrofitted to implement a new interface.&lt;/strong&gt; All you need to do is implement the interface and add the required methods. Existing classes cannot be retrofitted easily to extend a new abstract class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interfaces are ideal for defining mix-ins.&lt;/strong&gt; A mix-in interface allows classes to declare additional, optional behavior (for example, Comparable). It allows the optional functionality to be mixed in with the primary functionality. Abstract classes cannot define mix-ins -- a class cannot extend more than one parent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interfaces allow for non-hierarchical frameworks.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have a class that has the functionality of many interfaces, it can implement them all. Without interfaces, you would have to create a bloated class hierarchy with a class for every combination of attributes, resulting in combinatorial explosion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interfaces enable safe functionality enhancements.&lt;/strong&gt; You can create wrapper classes using the Decorator pattern, a robust and flexible design. A wrapper class implements and contains the same interface, forwarding some functionality to existing methods, while adding specialized behavior to other methods. You can't do this with abstract methods - you must use inheritance instead, which is more fragile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the advantage of abstract classes providing basic implementation? You can provide an abstract skeletal implementation class with each interface. This combines the virtues of both interfaces and abstract classes. Skeletal implementations provide implementation assistance without imposing the severe constraints that abstract classes force when they serve as type definitions. For example, the &lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/collections/index.html"&gt;Collections Framework&lt;/a&gt; defines the type using interfaces, and provides a skeletal implementation for each one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't store them in the repository, the absolutely do need to be archived and versioned somehow, and your build system needs to know how to get them. Lots of people in Java world seem to use Maven for fetching dependencies automatically, but I've not used I, so I can't really recommend for or against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One good option might be to keep a separate repository of third party systems. If you're on Subversion, you could then use subversion's externals support to automatically check out the libraries form the other repository. Otherwise, I'd suggest keeping an internal Anonymous FTP (or similar) server which your build system can automatically fetch requirements from. Obviously you'll want to make sure you keep all the old versions of libraries, and have everything there backed up along with your repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download encryption libraries from &lt;a href="http://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Bouncycastle&lt;/a&gt; then you need to download the "Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy" from &lt;a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; (the files are at the bottom of the download page). Make sure you read the Readme-file on how to install it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have done this, and using the sample code supplied with the Bountycastle package you should be able to encrypt your data. You can go with a tripple DES implementation, which will give you 112 bits key (often referred to as 128 bit, but only 112 of them are actually secure), or as previously stated, you can use AES. My money would be on AES.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am looking for solution for the entire page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to specify only width of the element to be centered. Height of the element is not known in design time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When minimizing window, scrolling should appear only when all white space is gone.
In other words, width of screen should be represented as:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"leftSpace width=(screenWidth-widthOfCenteredElement)/2"+&lt;br /&gt;
"centeredElement width=widthOfCenteredElement"+&lt;br /&gt;
"rightSpace width=(screenWidth-widthOfCenteredElement)/2"  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the same for the height:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"topSpace height=(screenHeight-heightOfCenteredElement)/2"+&lt;br /&gt;
"centeredElement height=heightOfCenteredElement"+&lt;br /&gt;
"bottomSpace height=(screenWidth-heightOfCenteredElement)/2"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By practical I mean that use of tables is OK. I intend to use this layout mostly for special pages like login. So CSS purity is not so important here, while following standards is desirable for future compatibility.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Executive summary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    Attribute selectors may match in four ways:

    [att]
    Match when the element sets the "att" attribute, whatever the value of the attribute.
    [att=val]
    Match when the element's "att" attribute value is exactly "val".
    [att~=val]
    Match when the element's "att" attribute value is a space-separated list of
    "words", one of which is exactly "val". If this selector is used, the words in the 
    value must not contain spaces (since they are separated by spaces).
    [att|=val]
    Match when the element's "att" attribute value is a hyphen-separated list of
    "words", beginning with "val". The match always starts at the beginning of the
    attribute value. This is primarily intended to allow language subcode matches
    (e.g., the "lang" attribute in HTML) as described in RFC 3066 ([RFC3066]).
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#selectors"&gt;CSS3 also defines a list of selectors&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="http://rakaz.nl/item/how_well_do_browsers_support_css_selectors"&gt;the compatibility varies hugely&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's also &lt;a href="http://tools.css3.info/selectors-test/test.html"&gt;a nifty test suite&lt;/a&gt; that that shows which selectors work in your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for your example,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a[href^=http]
{
    background: url(external-uri);
    padding-left: 12px;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;should do the trick. Unfortunately, it is not supported by IE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people do suggest obfuscator, but they just do renaming of classes, methods, and fields with tough-to-remember character sequences but what about sensitive constant values?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you have developed the encryption and decryption component based on a password based encryption technique. Now in this case, any average Java person can use &lt;a href="http://www.kpdus.com/jad.html"&gt;JAD&lt;/a&gt; to decompile the class file and easily retrieve the password value (defined as constant) as well as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_%28cryptography%29"&gt;salt&lt;/a&gt; and in turn can decrypt the data by writing small independent program!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds like a bad idea: You are letting someone encrypt stuff with a 'hidden' key that you give him. I don't think this can be made secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe asymmetrical keys could work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deploy an encrypted license with a public key to decrypt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;let the customer create a new license and send it to you for encryption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;send a new license back to the client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure, but I believe the client can actually encrypt the license key with the public key you gave him. You can then decrypt it with your private key and re-encrypt as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could keep a separate public/private key pair per customer to make sure you actually are getting stuff from the right customer - now &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are responsible for the keys...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT *
   FROM Thing
   WHERE ID IN (SELECT max(ID) FROM Thing 
                   WHERE ThingID IN (1,2,3,4)
                   GROUP BY ThingID)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Given the highest ID also means the newest price)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I suggest you add a "IsCurrent" column that is 0 if it's not the latest price or 1 if it is the latest. This will add the possible risk of inconsistent data, but it will speed up the whole process a lot when the table gets bigger (if it is in an index). Then all you need to do is to...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT *
   FROM Thing
   WHERE ThingID IN (1,2,3,4)
     AND IsCurrent = 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, Markus updated the question to show that ID is a uniqueid, not an int. That makes writing the query even more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT T.* 
   FROM Thing T
   JOIN (SELECT ThingID, max(PriceDateTime)
            WHERE ThingID IN (1,2,3,4)
            GROUP BY ThingID) X ON X.ThingID = T.ThingID 
                                AND X.PriceDateTime = T.PriceDateTime
   WHERE ThingID IN (1,2,3,4)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd really suggest using either a "IsCurrent" column or go with the other suggestion found in the answers and use "current price" table and a separate "price history" table (which would ultimately be the fastest, because it keeps the price table itself small).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I know that the ThingID at the bottom is redundant. Just try if it is faster with or without that "WHERE". Not sure which version will be faster after the optimizer did its work.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A GSM modem connected to a PC running
  a web based (ASP.NET) application. In
  the application the user selects a
  phone number from a list of phone nos.
  When he clicks on a button named the
  PC should call the selected phone
  number. When the person on the phone
  responds he should be able to have a
  conversation with the PC user.
  Similarly there should be a facility
  to send SMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I don't want any code listings. I just need to know what would be the requirements besides asp.net, database for storing phone numbers, and GSM modem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any help in terms of reference websites would be highly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One issue I don't like is when I want to delete a whole bunch of stuff, it will go through my collection and do a delete on each one.  This takes ages, so for this kind of instance, I've had to write some custom sql (delete from table where blah).  I'm no expert on XPO, but that's what I found.&lt;/p&gt;

If you capture that event, by adding an eventlistener to the body, you can look at the event.target and see what element was at that position. I'm unsure as to what degree IE supports this method, maybe someone else knows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of specs on the system:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual Studio 2005, C#&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Primary project is a Web Application Project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;40 projects in total (4 Web projects)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We use the internal VS webserver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We extensively use user controls, right down to a user control which contains a textbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have a couple of inline web projects that allows us to do partial deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About 120 user controls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About 200.000 lines of code (incl. HTML)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We use Source Safe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I would like to know is how to bring down the time it takes when hitting the site with a browser for the first time. And, I'm not talking about post full deployment - I'm talking about doing a small change in the code, build, refresh browser.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This first hit, takes about 1 minute 15 seconds before data gets back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To speed things up, I have experimented a little with Ram disks, specifically changing the &amp;lt;compilation&amp;gt; attribute in web.config, setting the tempDirectory to my Ram disk. 

This does speed things up a bit. Interestingly though, this totally removed ALL IO access during first hit from the browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Remarks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We never do a full compile during development, only partial. For example, the class library being worked on is compiled and then the main site is compiled which then copies the binaries from the class library to the bin directory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that the asp.net engine needs to parse all the ascx/aspx files after critical files have been changed (bin dir for example) but, what I don't understand is why it needs to do that when only &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; library dll has been modified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, anybody know of a way to either:
Sub segment the solutions to provide faster first hit or fine tune settings in config files or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, again: I'm only talking about development, NOT production deployment, so doing the pre-built compile option is not applicable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Ruvan&lt;/p&gt;
