When the VS2005 code returns a vector, the object has memory layout different from what VS2008 expects. That should be the reason for the broken values you see in the returned date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a rule of thumb, you should always compile all C++ modules of a project with the same compiler and all settings/#defines equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One particular #define that causes similar behaviour is the SECURE_SCL #define of VS2008. Two modules compiled with different settings will create exactly your problems, because #defining SECURE_SCL introduces more member variables to various C++ library classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;another option might be to change the date to a string and concatenate with the id so you have only one column. This would be slightly nasty though.&lt;/p&gt;

UpdateID int not null,
PriceDateTime datetime not null,

&lt;p&gt;Also many of the obfuscators are also able to scramble your string constants and remove unused code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another possible solution (not necessarily excluding the obfuscation) is to use &lt;a href="http://www.componio.com/products/jinstaller/jinstaller_secure_edition/jarcryp.html"&gt;encrypted JAR files&lt;/a&gt; and a custom classloader that does the decryption (preferably using native runtime library).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third (and possibly offering the strongest protection) is to use native ahead of time compilers like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection"&gt;GCC&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.excelsior-usa.com/jet.html"&gt;Excelsior JET&lt;/a&gt;, for example, that compile your Java code directly to a platform specific native binary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case You've got to remember that as the saying goes in Estonian "Locks are for animals". Meaning that every bit of code is available (loaded into memory) during the runtime and given enough skill, determination and motivation, people can and will decompile, unscramble and hack your code... Your job is simply to make the process as uncomfortable as you can and still keep the thing working...&lt;/p&gt;

I am using it to show a new div with a list gathered from a database when a button is pressed.  The problem is the button needs to do a postback to get this list as I don't want to make the call to the database unless it's needed.  The postback however stops the animation mid flow and resets it.  The button is within an update panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally I would want the animation to start once the postback is complete and the list has been gathered.  I have looked into using the &lt;code&gt;ScriptManager&lt;/code&gt; to detect when the postback is complete and have made some progress.  I have added two javascript methods to the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function linkPostback() {

        var prm = Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManager.getInstance();
        prm.add_endRequest(playAnimation)
    }

    function playAnimation() {
        var onclkBehavior = $find("ctl00_btnOpenList").get_OnClickBehavior().get_animation();
        onclkBehavior.play();
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Ive changed the &lt;code&gt;btnOpenList.OnClientClick=linkPostback();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This almost solves the problem.  Im still get some animation stutter.  The animation starts to play before the postback and then plays properly after postback.  Using the &lt;code&gt;onclkBehavior.pause()&lt;/code&gt; has no effect.  I can get around this by setting the &lt;code&gt;AnimationExtender.Enabled = false&lt;/code&gt; and setting it to true in the buttons postback event.  This however works only once as now the AnimationExtender is enabled again.  I have also tried disabling the &lt;code&gt;AnimationExtender&lt;/code&gt; via javascript but this has no effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a way of playing the animations only via javascript calls?  I need to decouple the automatic link to the 
buttons click event so I can control when the animation is fired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, a GSM modem is probably not the way you'd want to go as they usually don't allow for concurrency. So unless you just want one user at the time to use your service, you'd probably need another solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, think about cost issues - at least where I live, providing such a service would be prohibitively expensive using a normal GSM modem and a normal contract - but this is drifting into off-topicness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next issue will be to get voice data from the client to the server (which will relay it to the phone system - using whatever practical means). Pure browser based functionality won't be of much help, so you would absolutely need something plugin based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flash may work, seeing they provide access to the microphone, but please don't ask me about the details. I've never done anything like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, privacy would be a concern. While GSM data is encrypted, the path between client and server is not per default. And even if you use SSL, you'd have to convince your users trusting you that you don't record all the conversations going on, but this too is more of a political than a coding issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you'd have to think of bandwidth. Voice uses a lot of it and also it requires low latency. If you use a SIP trunk, you'll need the bandwidth twice per user: Once from and to your client and once from and to the SIP trunk. Calculate with 10-64 KBit/s per user and channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A feasible architecture would probably be to use a SIP trunk (they optimize on using VoIP as much as possible and thus can provide much lower rates than a GSM provider generally does. Also, they allow for concurrency), an Asterisk box (&lt;a href="http://www.asterisk.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.asterisk.org&lt;/a&gt; - a free PBX), some custom made flash client and a custom made SIP client on the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, this is quite the undertaking :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First and foremost - do not bind your form data directly to a database.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a separate data/model layer that you bind your form widgets to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there on, you have several options available to you depending on the level of stability and availability you need to provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably one of the simplest solutions here would be to just enable/disable the parts of application that need to interact with a database based on the connection state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next level of protection would include caching the part of the data model locally and while the database connection is down, using local cache for viewing and disabling any functions that require explicit database connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the trickiest thing (that may also provide the most stable experience to the end user) is to replicate the database locally and use some sort of synchronization schema to keep your copy of the database in sync with remote db.&lt;/p&gt;

There are applications that can work offline - Microsoft Outlook for example. Such applications doesn't treat connectivity exceptions as critical, they can save your work locally and synchronize it later. Another applications such as online games will treat communication problem as critical exception and will quit if connection gets lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of error handling, I think that you should control exceptions on all layers rather than relying on some general exception handling piece of code. Your business layer should understand what happened on lower layer (data access layer in our case)  and respond correspondingly. Connection lost should not be treated as &lt;em&gt;unexpected exception&lt;/em&gt; in my opinion. For good practices of exceptions management I recommend to take a look at &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc309505.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;Exception Handling Application Block&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerning application behavior, you should answer yourself on the following question "Does my application have business value for customer in disconnected state?" In many cases it would be beneficial to end user to be able to continues their work in disconnected state. However such behavior tremendously hard to implement.&lt;/p&gt;

The simplest solution, if your backend is FSFS (the default on recent versions), is to make a filesystem copy of the entire repository folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a Berkley DB backend, if you're not sure of what your backend is, or if you're changing SVN version numbers, you're going to want to use svnadmin to dump your old repository and load it into your new repository.  Using &lt;code&gt;svnadmin dump&lt;/code&gt; will give you a single file backup that you can copy to the new system.  Then you can create the new (empty) repository and use &lt;code&gt;svnadmin load&lt;/code&gt;, which will essentially replay all the commits along with its metadata (author, timestamp, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read more about the dump/load process here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch05s03.html#svn-ch-5-sect-3.5"&gt;http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch05s03.html#svn-ch-5-sect-3.5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you do &lt;code&gt;svnadmin load&lt;/code&gt;, make sure you use the &lt;code&gt;--force-uuid&lt;/code&gt; option, or otherwise people are going to have problems switching to the new repository.  Subversion uses a UUID to identify the repository internally, and it won't let you switch a working copy to a different repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't have filesystem access, there may be other third party options out there (or you can write something) to help you migrate: essentially you'd have to use the svn log to replay each revision on the new repository, and then fix up the metadata afterwards.  You'll need the pre-revprop-change and post-revprop-change hook scripts in place to do this, which sort of assumes filesystem access, so YMMV.  Or, if you don't want to keep the history, you can use your working copy to import into the new repository.  But hopefully this isn't the case.&lt;/p&gt;

If you want a copy that's a merge, then use copy (or &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/copy.html"&gt;deepcopy&lt;/a&gt;, depending on what you want) and then update.  The two lines of code are much more readable - more Pythonic - than the single line creation with .items() + .items().  Explicit is better than implicit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, when you use .items() (pre Python 3.0), you're creating a new list that contains the items from the dict.  If your dictionaries are large, then that is quite a lot of overhead (two large lists that will be thrown away as soon as the merged dict is created).  update() can work more efficiently, because it can run through the second dict item-by-item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/timeit.html"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

41.484580039978027
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMO the tiny slowdown between the first two is worth it for the readability.  In addition, keyword arguments for dictionary creation was only added in Python 2.3, whereas copy() and update() will work in older versions.&lt;/p&gt;

Some terminology -&lt;/p&gt;

D(X) = Dectrypt X. (Note that D(E(X)) = X)
IV = Initialization vector. A random sequence to bootstrap the CBC algorithm
CBC = Cipher block chaining.

&lt;p&gt;A really simple CBC implementation can look like:
P1, P2, P3 = Plain text messages&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. Generate an IV, just random bits.
2. Calculate E( P1 xor IV) call this C1
3. Calculate E( P2 xor C1) call this C2
4. Calculate E( P3 xor C2) call this C3.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the result of encrypting P1, P2 and P3 (in that order) is different from encrypting P2, P1 and P3 (in that order). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in a CBC implementation, order is important. Any algorithm where order is important can not, by definition, be thread safe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is untested, but it should to the trick:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^([^.]+)\.blah\.domain\.com$
RewriteRule ^/(.*)$           http://blah.domain.com/%1/$1 [L,R]

The first three steps allow your app to act as a role handler for the relevant URL schemes (HTTP and HTTPS) and the final step makes it the default role handler for those schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Add the URL schemes your app can handle to your application's info.plist file&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add support for &lt;code&gt;http://&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;https://&lt;/code&gt; you'd need to add the following to your application's info.plist file. This tells the OS that your application is capable of handling HTTP and HTTP URLs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-xml prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;CFBundleURLTypes&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;array&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;dict&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;key&amp;gt;CFBundleURLName&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;string&amp;gt;http URL&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;key&amp;gt;CFBundleURLSchemes&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;array&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;string&amp;gt;http&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/array&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/dict&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;dict&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;key&amp;gt;CFBundleURLName&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;string&amp;gt;Secure http URL&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;key&amp;gt;CFBundleURLSchemes&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;array&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;string&amp;gt;https&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/array&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/dict&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/array&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Write an URL handler method&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method will be called by the OS when it wants to use your application to open a URL. It doesn't matter which object you add this method to, that'll be explicitly passed to the Event Manager in the next step. The URL handler method should look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- (void)getUrl:(NSAppleEventDescriptor *)event 
    withReplyEvent:(NSAppleEventDescriptor *)replyEvent
{
  // Get the URL
  NSString *urlStr = [[event paramDescriptorForKeyword:keyDirectObject] 
    stringValue];

  //TODO: Your custom URL handling code here
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Register the URL handler method&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, tell the event manager which object and method to call when it wants to use your app to load an URL. In the code here I'm passed &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; as the event handler, assuming that we're calling &lt;code&gt;setEventHandler&lt;/code&gt; from the same object that defines the &lt;code&gt;getUrl:withReplyEvent:&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should add this code somewhere in your application's initialisation code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;NSAppleEventManager *em = [NSAppleEventManager sharedAppleEventManager];
[em 
  setEventHandler:self 
  andSelector:@selector(getUrl:withReplyEvent:) 
  forEventClass:kInternetEventClass 
  andEventID:kAEGetURL];
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some applications, including early versions of Adobe AIR, use the alternative WWW!/OURL AppleEvent to request that an application opens URLs, so to be compatible with those applications you should also add the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[em
  setEventHandler:self 
  andSelector:@selector(getUrl:withReplyEvent:) 
  forEventClass:'WWW!' 
  andEventID:'OURL'];
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Set your app as the default browser&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything we've done so far as told the OS that your application is &lt;em&gt;a browser&lt;/em&gt;, now we need to make it &lt;em&gt;the default browser&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've got to use the Launch Services API to do this. In this case we're setting our app to be the default role handler for HTTP and HTTPS links:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CFStringRef bundleID = (CFStringRef)[[NSBundle mainBundle] bundleIdentifier];
OSStatus httpResult = LSSetDefaultHandlerForURLScheme(CFSTR("http"), bundleID);
OSStatus httpsResult = LSSetDefaultHandlerForURLScheme(CFSTR("https"), bundleID);
//TODO: Check httpResult and httpsResult for errors
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(It's probably best to ask the user's permission before changing their default browser.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Custom URL schemes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that you can also use these same steps to handle your own custom URL schemes. If you're creating a custom URL scheme it's a good idea to base it on your app's bundle identifier to avoid clashes with other apps. So if your bundle ID is &lt;code&gt;com.example.MyApp&lt;/code&gt; you should consider using &lt;code&gt;x-com-example-myapp://&lt;/code&gt; URLs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, &lt;strong&gt;the main problem has always initialization&lt;/strong&gt;.. You need to remember that the designer cannot/does not instantiate forms in the same way it does at run time (similarly, it cannot do this with web dev, which is why care is needed with custom control rendering).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;strong&gt;once a form is changed, a complete re-build of the project is required&lt;/strong&gt; in order to propagate the changes to the form to the child forms that inherit from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally have seen no evidence to suggest that it has been "shunned". &lt;strong&gt;AFAIK, its still good practice to exercise code re-use where possible. Visual inheritance provides that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May I suggest creating a new question with the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; problems you are having, with sample code? We can then look at it to see if we can get it working and explain why :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve the problem, first define a table valued function to retrieve the top n rows from Thing for a specific id, date ordered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CREATE FUNCTION dbo.fn_GetTopThings(@ThingID AS GUID, @n AS INT)
  RETURNS TABLE
AS
RETURN
  SELECT TOP(@n) *
  FROM Things
  WHERE ThingID= @ThingID
  ORDER BY PriceDateTime DESC
GO
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then use the function to retrieve the top 1 records in a query:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT *
   FROM Thing t
CROSS APPLY dbo.fn_GetTopThings(t.ThingID, 1)
WHERE t.ThingID IN (1,2,3,4,5,6)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The magic here is done by the APPLY clause which &lt;strong&gt;applies the function to every row in the left result set&lt;/strong&gt; then joins with the result set returned by the function then retuns the final result set. (Note: to do a left join like apply, use OUTTER APPLY which returns all rows from the left side, while CROSS APPLY returns only the rows that have a match in the right side)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BlaM:
Because I can't post comments yet( due to low rept points) not even to my own answers ^^, I'll answer in the body of the message:
   -the APPLY clause even, if it uses table valued functions it is optimized internally by SQL Server in such a way that it doesn't call the function for every row in the left result set, but instead takes the inner sql from the function and converts it into a join clause with the rest of the query, so the performance is equivalent or even better (if the plan is chosen right by sql server and further optimizations can be done) than the performance of a query using subqueries), and in my personal experience APPLY has no performance issues when the database is properly indexed and statistics are up to date (just like a normal query with subqueries behaves in such conditions)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;lowercase, lowercase_with_underscores&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commonly used for local variables and function names (typical C syntax).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;UPPERCASE, UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commonly used for constants and variables that never change. Some (older) languages like BASIC also have a convention for using all upper case for all variable names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CamelCase, javaCamelCase:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically used for function names and variable names. Some use it only for functions and combine it with lowercase or lowercase_with_underscores for variables. When javaCamelCase is used, it's typically used both for functions and variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This syntax is also quite common for external APIs, since this is how the Win32 and Java APIs do it. (Even if a library uses a different convention internally they typically export with the (java)CamelCase syntax for function names.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;prefix_CamelCase, prefix_lowercase, prefix_lowercase_with_underscores:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commonly used in languages that don't support namespaces (i.e. C). The prefix will usually denote the library or module to which the function or variable belongs. Usually reserved to global variables and global functions. Prefix can also be in UPPERCASE. Some conventions use lowercase prefix for internal functions and variables and UPPERCASE prefix for exported ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are of course many other ways to name things, but most conventions are based on one of the ones mentioned above or a variety on those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW: I forgot to mention Hungarian notation on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;There's an varying number of text-only menu items and the page layout is fluid.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The remaining items should be spread optimally on the menu bar.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was always taught that you should only have execute permissions of stored procedures to your data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should never have select / insert / update / delete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This is because of performance and security)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get the data out of LINQ you obviously need select permissions.  I know you can use stored procs with LINQ, but since I can't do joins what's the point?&lt;/p&gt;

This solution doesn't work with WebKit browsers, though (e.g. Chromium, Midori, Epiphany), they still show trailing space after the last item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put the menu bar in a &lt;em&gt;justified paragraph&lt;/em&gt;. Problem is that the last line of a justified paragraph won't be rendered justified, for obvious reasons. Therefore I add a wide invisible element (e.g. an img) which warrants that the paragraph is at least two lines long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the menu bar is justified by the same algorithm the browser uses for justifying plain text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div style="width:500px; background:#eee;"&amp;gt;

 &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There's an varying number of text-only menu items and the page layout is fluid.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The first menu item should be left-aligned, the last menu item should be right-aligned. The remaining items should be spread optimal on the menu bar.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The number is varying,so there's no chance to pre-calculate the optimal widths.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Note that a TABLE won't work here as well:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If you center all TDs, the first and the last item aren't aligned correctly.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If you left-align and right-align the first resp. the last items, the spacing will be sub-optimal.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remark: Do you notice I cheated? To add the space filler element, I have to make some guess about the width of the menu bar. So this solution is not completely down to the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major requirement is to be able to use it in a designer without adding any C# code.  In order for that to even be feasible, it needs to retain its structure in the tree-view model.  In other words, if I were working with this in Expression Blend or Mobiform Aurora, I would be able to select the chart from the logical tree or select any of the individual pens to edit their properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A waterfall process makes itself redundant by the time you've finished due to the amount of time it takes to complete. By the time you've finished the client has changed the way they work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why iterative development and iterative releases work so much better than waterfall. You'll spend less time developing redundant packages and you'll make the customer happier too by being better able to respond to the changes in their requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paradigm in general is better. You don't blueprint and create perfection. You assume from the outset that it wont be perfect and you "grow" the software by making it flexible and easy to change. &lt;/p&gt;

It was designed around loose typed languages like C, and not for strong typed languages like C++. At the time I was programming Windows 3.0 using Borland's Turbo Pascal 1.0 for Windows, which later became Delphi. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway long story short at this time the team I was working on developed our own standards very simple and applicable to almost all languages, based on simple prefixes -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a - argument &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;l - local &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;m - member &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;g - global&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emphasis here is on scope, rely on the compiler to check type, all you need care about is scope, where the data lives. This has many advantages over nasty old Hungarian notation in that if you change the type of something via refactoring you don't have to search and replace all instances of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly 16 years later I still promote the use of this practice, and have found it applicable to almost every language I have developed in. &lt;/p&gt;

I prefer it to Emma because it does branch coverage as well as line coverage and because I think the HTML reports it generates are nicer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of why branch coverage is important is code that uses the ternary operator (a ? b : c).  If the tool does only line coverage, this statement will be considered 100% covered even if it always executes the same branch.  With branch coverage it will be only 50% covered unless both branches have been executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code coverage doesn't directly help you write better code, but it does help you write better tests, which in turn help you write better code.  Code coverage will uncover execution paths that are not being exercised by your tests.  As well as indicating where you can improve your tests, this can also identify pieces of code that can be removed (since they are not being used).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use a continuous integration tool, such as &lt;a href="http://hudson-ci.org"&gt;Hudson&lt;/a&gt;, you can plot your coverage scores over time, which can be useful for indentifying trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also look into the AutoSize property. It takes care of sizing when the value of the label, say, changes. Also, don't forget about Docking and Anchoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all well and good, and is a tremdous improvement over what we did in the past, but we have a problem with rerunning scripts.  Obviously this isn't a problem with some scripts like altering procedures, because you can run them over and over without adversly affecting the system. Right now to add metadata and run statements like create/alter table statements we add code to check and see if the objects exists, and if they do, don't run them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our problem is that we really only get one shot to run the script, because once the script has been run, the objects are in the environment and system won't run the script again.  If something needs to change once it's been deployed, we have a difficult process of running update scripts agaist the update scripts and hoping that everything falls in the correct order and all of the PKs line up between the environments (the databases are, shall we say, "special").&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short of dropping the database and starting the process from scratch (the last most current release), does anyone have a more elegant solution to this?  &lt;/p&gt;

Firstly, email can take a long time to go through.  There isn't any guaranteed time that an email will be delivered in.  It's not even guaranteed that the email will get there at all.  I know things usually are quick, but it's not uncommon to take up to 10 minutes for a round trip to be completed. Also, unless you're encrypting the email, the link you are sending back is sent in the open. That means anybody can use that link to log in.  Depending one how secure you want to be, this may or may not be an issue, but it's definitely something to think about.

This technique is present also in Java language, where one can convert string to class using &lt;code&gt;Class.forClass('classname')&lt;/code&gt; method. It is also quite handy to defer algorithm complexity to several classes instead of having list of if-conditions. Dynamic class names are especially well suited in situations where you want your code to remain open for extension without the need for modifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I myself often use different classes in conjunction with database tables. In one column I keep class name that will be used to handle the record. This gives me great power of adding new types of records and handle them in unique way without changing a single byte in existing code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You shouldn't be concerned about the performance. It has almost no overhead and objects themselves are super fast in PHP. If you need to spawn thousands of identical objects, use &lt;a href="http://www.dofactory.com/Patterns/PatternFlyweight.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;Flyweight&lt;/a&gt; design pattern to reduce memory footprint. Especially, you should not sacrifice your time as a developer just to save milliseconds on server. Also op-code optimisers work seamlessly with this technique. Scripts compiled with Zend Optimizer did not misbehave.&lt;/p&gt;

  of the server process so you know when
  the server is ready before starting
  the client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is more elegant than sleeping for a fixed (or supplied via parameter) amount of time. However, 
&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.process.waitforinputidle.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;WaitForInputIdle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;applies only to processes with a user
  interface and, therefore, a message
  loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so this may not work, depending on the characteristics of launch-server-application. However, as Lars pointed out to me, the question referred to a &lt;em&gt;windowed&lt;/em&gt; application (which I missed when I read the question), so his solution is probably best.&lt;/p&gt;

Simply explaining things to somebody else often gives you insights into what you are doing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to work with somebody that recommended "talking to teddy" - i.e. pick your favourite stuffed toy (Mr Binky), explain the ins and outs of that new RESTful API you are working on to Mr Binky. Slap your head as a blinding flash of inspiration hits you - "gah, I &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; that I needed another resource in there, thanks Binkster!". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mind you, I'm not sure of that colleagues sanity...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a more reasoned approach, couldn't you form a loose alliance with another developer where you bounce your projects off each other, even if you then go back to working in isolation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only complications are addressing more than 4GB of memory space, dealing with pieces of code you can't cross-compile to a 32-bit architecture (64 bit object files for which you have no source, etc), and general 64 bit migration issues (platform specific code such as checking for 0xFFFFFFFF instead of -1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What other problems are you running into doing bounds checking on your program?  Are you unable to compile a 32 bit version?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not your ideal solution, certainly, and one should always check the code they're going to run, but in this case you might not have a choice, unless you want to do your own bounds checking (which is a good idea in any case...).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I believe happens, is that when the cursor moves from a parent element onto a child element, a mouseout event occurs on the parent element, and a mouseover event occurs on the child element. However, if the mouseover handler on the child element does not catch the event and stop it propagating, the parent element will also receive the mouseover event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have discovered one possible solution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    TIDs are "tuple identifiers" or row addresses.  The TID contains the
    page number and the index of the offset to the row relative to the
    page boundary.  TIDs are presently implemented as 4-byte integers.
    The TID uniquely identifies each row in a table.  Every row has a
    TID.  The high-order 23 bits of the TID are the page number of the page
    in which the row occurs.  The TID can be addressed in SQL by the name 
    `tid.'
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you can limit the number of rows coming back using something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;select * from SomeTable where tid &amp;lt; 2048&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method is somewhat inexact in the number of rows it returns. It's fine for my requirement though because I just want to limit rows coming back from a very large result set to speed up testing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no requirement by Subversion to run on a server, I actually run it on my local machine and keep my repositories on a separate drive. Connecting to the repository uses svn:// instead of http://. I'm not sure why you require that it does not expose itself to the network, but this would be a matter of security via obscurity.

&lt;p&gt;Once the repository has been created, commits and updates from the repository are as simple as right-clicking on a folder in Windows Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;

They essentially take away the central repository part, so it should be ideal to use when you're a solo developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another advantage is that when you decide to add people to your one-man team, you don't have to set up a central repository. All they have to do is clone your repository and they're good to go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're windows based and are used to a shell plugin like TortoiseSVN I'd pick mercurial. Their windows integration is just a bit better than git's, using TortoiseHg. The git counterpart (cheetah) is on hold at the moment, due to the developer getting sick and tired of all the demands people were making ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If DVCS is too exotic for this situation you could always rely on SVN. I've heard good stories about the already mentioned VisualSVN solution. Install, make some repositories and go. Install TortoiseSVN for shell integration, or perhaps Subclipse or ankhSVN for eclipse and visual studio, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: I have not actually tried git or mercurial in a real life project, just some test setups. I now have a simple project WITH version control (using mercurial in my case), without having to have access to a central repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide the fields you want in the code.  Bit-pack as much as possible.  For example, dates could be "number of days since 2007," and then you can get away with 16-bits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add an extra "checksum" field.  (You'll see why in a second.)  The value of this field is a checksum of the packed bytes from the other fields.  We use "first 32 bits from MD5."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encrypt everything using &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Encryption_Algorithm"&gt;TEA&lt;/a&gt;.  For the key, use something that identifies the customer (e.g. company name + personal email address), that way if someone wants to post a key on the interweb they have to include their own contact info in plain text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convert hex to a string in some sensible way.  You can do straight hex digits but some people like to pick a different set of 16 characters to make it less obvious.  Also include dashes or something regularly so it's easier to read it over the phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To decrypt, convert hex to string and decrypt with TEA.  But then there's this extra step: Compute your own checksum of the fields (ignoring the checksum field) and compare to the given checksum.  &lt;em&gt;This is the step that ensures no one tampered with the key&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is that TEA mixes the bits completely, so if even one bit is changed, all other bits are equally likely to change during TEA decryption, therefore the checksum will not pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this hackable?  Of course!  Almost everything is, but this is tight enough and simple to implement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If tying to contact information is not sufficient, then include a field for "Node ID" and lock it to MAC address or somesuch as you suggest.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What is static analysis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyzing code without executing it. Generally used to find bugs or ensure conformance to coding guidelines. The classic example is a compiler which finds lexical, syntactic and even some semantic mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When should you use it, and when shouldn't it be used?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Static analysis tools should be used when they help maintain code quality. If they're used, they should be integrated into the build process, otherwise they will be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What are potential gotchas regarding proper and improper usage/application of static analysis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two common pathologies occur when using static analysis tools:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tools produces spurious warnings/errors that the developers cannot silence. Eventually, most of the warnings are spurious and the developers stop paying attention to the output. This is why many teams require that code compile cleanly. If developers feel comfortable ignoring compiler warnings, the compile phase will eventually be filled with warning nobody ever pays attention to, even though they may be bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tools take too long to run and developers never bother to run them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Any languages that don't have a good static analysis tool, and what do you do when you don't have an option for automated analysis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a number of reasons, many of the dynamic languages (ruby, python, perl) don't have static analysis tools that are as strong as those available in static languages. The standard method of finding bugs and making sure the code is working in dynamic languages are unit tests which help build confidence that the code actually works (hat-tip: Chris Conway).&lt;/p&gt;

He gave me a baffled look and asked when anyone would ever need to do such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off the top of my head I didn't have a good answer for him, other than "hey, I need to do it right now".  So I sat down and came up with a list of some of the things I've actually done with reflection in various languages.  Unfortunately, most of my examples come from my web programming in Python, and I was hoping that the people here would have more examples.  Here's the list I came up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given a config file with lines like&lt;br /&gt;
x = "Hello World!"&lt;br /&gt;
y = 5.0&lt;br /&gt;
dynamically set the fields of some &lt;code&gt;config&lt;/code&gt; object equal to the values in that file.  (This was what I wished I could do in C++, but actually couldn't do.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When sorting a list of objects, sort based on an arbitrary attribute given that attribute's name from a config file or web request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When writing software that uses a network protocol, reflection lets you call methods based on string values from that protocol.  For example, I wrote an IRC bot that would translate&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;!some_command arg1 arg2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
into a method call &lt;code&gt;actions.some_command(arg1, arg2)&lt;/code&gt; and print whatever that function returned back to the IRC channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When using Python's __getattr__ function (which is sort of like method_missing in Ruby/Smalltalk) I was working with a class with a whole lot of statistics, such as late_total.  For every statistic, I wanted to be able to add _percent to get that statistic as a percentage of the total things I was counting (for example, stats.late_total_percent).  Reflection made this very easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So can anyone here give any examples from their own programming experiences of times when reflection has been helpful?  The next time a co-worker asks me why I'd "ever want to do something like that" I'd like to be more prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For mobile apps, you can also implement auto-upgrades, although it is a little trickier.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, to answer your question in a broad sense, I don't know if it is expected that all enterprise apps should make upgrading easy, but it certainly is worth the money from an IT support standpoint to architect them to allow for easy upgrading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Casual web-based games have moved away from Java to Flash, because a considerably higher percentage of casual web surfers have Flash installed than have a JRE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Console and PC games do not use Java to any extent. They are primarily C++ right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High end smartphones (Symbian, Windows Mobile, iPhone, etc) have native SDKs, and if they support Java at all tend to discourage its use. Blackberry is Java based, but there are relatively few games for the Blackberry. I'd have to speculate there is not much demand for games on that device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one place where Java is commonly used for games is in low end mobile phones. This has not been a terribly successful category, only a few companies have made money. There are two problems with this space, so far as I can tell:&lt;br /&gt;
* write-once-run-anywhere never worked out. The QA and testing load to support a reasonable selection of devices is demanding, and never-ending since new phones come out all the time.&lt;br /&gt;
* To distribute your game you need a business relationship with the wireless carrier, and they demand a 50% (or more) cut.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last thing: the games industry is famous for programmer burnout. You should search Google for stories about developers at Electronic Arts. Games nowadays are extraordinarily large projects which &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; meet a particular deadline to have a chance at making their sales targets, and they ratchet up the hours as needed to meet that deadline. Developer burnout is handled via the never-ending supply of young developers enamored with developing games for a living, i.e. replace burned out engineers with fresh ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you know what you're getting into.&lt;/p&gt;

If we implemented an auto-upgrade, our customers would mutiny!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large installations have peculiar issues that don't apply to small ones.  For example, with 2000 users (not all of whom are, let us say, the most sophisticated of tool users), tool-training is a big deal: training time, internal demos, internal process documents, etc..  They cannot unleash a new feature or UI change without a chance to understand how it fits in their process and therefore what their internal best practices are and how to communicate that to their users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also when applications fail, it's the internal IT team who are responsible.  Therefore, they want time to install a new version in a test area, beat it up, and deploy on a Saturday only when they're good and ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see the value in making minor patches more easy to install, particularly when the patch is just for a bug-fix and not for anything that would require retraining, and if the  admins still get final say over when it's installed.  But even then, I don't believe anyone has ever asked for this!  Whether because they don't want it or they are trained to not expect it, it doesn't seem worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least that's what happened to me, if I remember correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;QueryPerformanceCounter and QueryPerformanceFrequency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms644904.aspx"&gt;QueryPerformanceCounter&lt;/a&gt; will return a "performance counter" which is actually a CPU-managed 64-bit counter that increments from 0 starting with the computer power-on. The frequency of this counter is returned by the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms644905.aspx"&gt;QueryPerformanceFrequency&lt;/a&gt;. To get the time reference in &lt;strong&gt;seconds&lt;/strong&gt;, divide performance counter by performance frequency. In Delphi:    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function QueryPerfCounterAsUS: int64;     
begin
  if QueryPerformanceCounter(Result) and
     QueryPerformanceFrequency(perfFreq)
  then
    Result := Round(Result / perfFreq * 1000000);
  else
    Result := 0;
end;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On multiprocessor platforms, QueryPerformanceCounter &lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt; return consistent results regardless of the CPU the thread is currently running on. There are occasional problems, though, usually caused by bugs in hardware chips or BIOSes. Usually, patches are provided by motherboard manufacturers. Two examples from the MSDN:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/895980"&gt;Programs that use the QueryPerformanceCounter function may perform poorly in Windows Server 2003 and in Windows XP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/274323"&gt;Performance counter value may unexpectedly leap forward&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem with QueryPerformanceCounter is that it is quite slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;RDTSC instruction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can limit your code to one CPU (SetThreadAffinity), you can use &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDTSC"&gt;RDTSC&lt;/a&gt; assembler instruction to query performance counter directly from the processor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function CPUGetTick: int64;
asm
  dw 310Fh // rdtsc
end;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RDTSC result is incremented with same frequency as QueryPerformanceCounter. Divide it by QueryPerformanceFrequency to get time in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QueryPerformanceCounter is much slower thatn RDTSC because it must take into account multiple CPUs and CPUs with variable frequency. From &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/09/08/8931563.aspx"&gt;Raymon Chen's blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;(QueryPerformanceCounter) counts elapsed time. It has to, since its value is 
  governed by the QueryPerformanceFrequency function, which returns a number 
  specifying the number of units per second, and the frequency is spec'd as not 
  changing while the system is running. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;For CPUs that can run at variable speed, this means that the HAL cannot 
  use an instruction like RDTSC, since that does not correlate with elapsed time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;timeGetTime&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms713418.aspx"&gt;TimeGetTime&lt;/a&gt; belongs to the Win32 multimedia Win32 functions. It returns time in milliseconds with 1 ms resolution, at least on a modern hardware. It doesn't hurt if you run   timeBeginPeriod(1) before you start measuring time and timeEndPeriod(1) when you're done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;GetLocalTime and GetSystemTime&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Vista, both &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms713418.aspx"&gt;GetLocalTime&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms724390.aspx"&gt;GetSystemTime&lt;/a&gt; return current time with millisecond precision, but they are not accurate to a millisecond. Their accuracy is typically in the range of 10 to 55 milliseconds. (&lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/09/02/459952.aspx"&gt;Precision is not the same as accuracy&lt;/a&gt;)
On Vista, GetLocalTime and GetSystemTime both work with 1 ms resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

Both can key off either the MAC address or a physical dongle, can be either node-locked (tied to one machine only) or "floating" (any authorized machine on the network can get a license doled out by a central license server, up to a maximum number of simultaneously checked-out copies determined by how much they've paid for).  There are a variety of flexible ways to set it up, including expiration dates, individual sub-licensed features, etc.  Integration into an application is not very difficult.  These are just the two I've used, I'm sure there are others that do the job just as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These programs are easily cracked, meaning that there are known exploits that let people either bypass the security of your application that uses them, either by cutting their own licenses to spoof the license server, or by merely patching your binary to bypass the license check (essentially replacing the subroutine call to their library with code that just says "return 'true'".  It's more complicated than that, but that's what it mostly boils down to.  You'll see cracked versions of your product posted to various Warez sites.  It can be very frustrating and demoralizing, all the more so because they're often interested in cracking for cracking sake, and don't even have any use for your product or knowledge of what to do with it.  (This is obvious if you have a sufficiently specialized program.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, some people will say you should write your own, maybe even change the encryption scheme frequently.  But I disagree.  It's true that rolling your own means that known exploits against FLEXlm or RLM won't instantly work for your application.  However, unless you are a total expert on this kind of security (which clearly you aren't or you wouldn't be asking the question), it's highly likely that in your inexperience you will end up writing a much less secure and more crackable scheme than the market leaders (weak as they may be).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other reason not to roll your own is simply that it's an endless cat and mouse game.  It's better for your customers and your sales to put minimal effort into license security and spend that time debugging or adding features.   You need to come to grips with the licensing scheme as merely "keeping honest people honest", but not preventing determined cracking.  Accept that the crackers wouldn't have paid for the software anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everybody can take this kind of zen attitude.  Some people can't sleep at night knowing that somebody somewhere is getting something for nothing.  But try to learn to deal with it.  You can't stop the pirates, but you can balance your time/effort/expense trying to stop all piracy versus making your product better for users.  Remember, sometimes the most pirated applications are also the most popular and profitable.  Good luck and sleep well.&lt;/p&gt;

   public static IConfigurationObject Factory(List&amp;lt;string&amp;gt; keyValuePair) {

       switch (keyValuePair[0]) {

          case "x":
              return new x(keyValuePair[1]);
              break;
          /* etc. */
          default:
              throw new ArgumentException("Wrong parameter in the file");
       }

  }

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strongest assumption here is that all your objects can be treated partly like the same (ie, they implement the same interface (IConfigurationObject in the example) or belong to the same inheritance tree).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they don't, then it depends on your program flow and what are you doing with them. But nonetheless, they should :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Given your explanation, you could have one Factory per file type, the switch in it would be the authoritative source on the allowed types per file type and they probably share something in common. Reflection is possible, but it's riskier because it's less obvious and self documenting than this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this specific case isn't specified, my reading of this says that the actual rendering of a 'selected' 'disabled' element is left up to the browser.  As long as the user cannot select it then it's working as standard.  It does say that a script can act upon the element, so it is possible for Javascript to set a disabled option as selected (or disable a selected option).  This isn't contrary to the standards, but on form submission, that option's value couldn't be the selected value.  The select list would (I assume) have to have an empty value in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unit testing (isn't this the third pilar?)... Well... I don't do any unit testing at all :(, and that's one of the things I'd like to change for future projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I design I try to take notes of all my internal thoughts (it's more or less like talking to your teddy, isn't it?).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also have a TODO list. I wonder if there is some application (or web application) to better monitorize all these tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll take a look to some of the modern methodologies and try to incorporate some techniques to my own methodology. &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/49594/developing-on-your-own#49637" rel="nofollow"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; seems really interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;let's say you have a table Customers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;create table Customers (
   id int identity(1,1) primary key,
   first_name varchar(255) not null,
   last_name varchar(255) not null
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and later you want to add a status column.  Don't modify your original table script, that one has already run (and can have the if(! exists) syntax to prevent it from causing errors while running again).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, have a new script, called add_customer_status.sql&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in this script you'll have something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;alter table Customers
add column status varchar(50) null

update Customers set status = 'Silver' where status is null

alter table Customers
alter column status varchar(50) not null
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again you can wrap this with an if(! exists) block to allow re-running, but here we've leveraged the notion that this is a change script, and we adapt the database accordingly.  If there is data already in the customers table then we're still okay, since we add the column, seed it with data, then add the not null constraint.&lt;/p&gt;

One one hand it's simple to determine if a key is valid (if the class has a setter setKey(String data)), on the other hand i can change the type of the (textual) input data and hide the transformation (e.g simple cast to int in getKey()), so the rest of the application can rely on correctly typed data.
If the type of some key-value-pair changes for one object (e.g. form int to float), i only have to change it in the data-object and its users but don't have to keep in mind to check the parser too. This might not be a sensible approach, if performance is an issue...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some additional language elements, like Properties (think getters and setters) and the ability to overload operators.  In general you don't need all of these things to get work done, but you do need to think about how they could be used.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newer features in the language like LINQ are just something you'll have to pick up over time.  Most C# programmers who have been working in the language for years don't really use LINQ outside of some experimentation.  Hopefully this will change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for .NET, well it's huge, just like the JAVA API, and picking it up is really a long labor of many years.  You can become quite good with sections of it though and be super productive very quickly.  My suggestions would be to focus on System.IO, System.XML, and System.Data, those seems to be the libraries that I see used most. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BackgroundWorker control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WaitHandles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Callback functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;polling an ASyncResult object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally you want to start at the top of that list and work down.  That means first look and see if a backgroundworker control is appropriate to the situation.  However, it pretty much assumes windows forms and that you're only spawning one new thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So next try waithandles.  Waithandles are good for coordinating several threads together.   You can kick them all off and wait for them all to finish, or if you want to keep a certain number active you keep waiting for just one and spawning the next when it finishes.  Or maybe you know one thread will finish much sooner, so you can wait for it to finish, do a little bit of work, and then wait for the rest to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waithandles might seem like a bit much if, say, you're only spawning one additional thread and you don't want to block until it's finished.  Then you might use a callback, so that the function you designate will be called as soon as the thread completes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if and only if for some reason none of the above will work you can fall back to polling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can think of 5 different ways to get a new thread in .Net, also roughly in order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OS created, normally as the result of winforms event (including the BackgoundWorker).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obj.Begin___()/End____().  Certain CLR classes already have these asynchronous methods defined for you, and obviously you want to use them when they're available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem().  Use this most of the time to create your own threads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delegate.BeginInvoke()/EndInvoke().  You can wrap any method this way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thread.Start().  You &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do it this way, but I read something recently (don't have the link now) that if QueueUserWorkItem won't work the delegate method is probably better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: @&lt;a href="#50460" rel="nofollow"&gt;George Mauer &lt;/a&gt;--  I have seen that as well, but this does not stop the page from rendering, just the Mediawiki engine from parsing the rest of the wikitext. Its as if hitting the custom function is signalling mediawiki that processing is done. I am in the process of diving into the rabbit hole but was hoping someone else has seen this behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to watch for when using a background worker that I have found is exception handlings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an exception is thrown on the async process it will not throw an exception to the main thread, the process will finish and BackgroundWorker RunWorkerCompleted event will fire with the error being hidden in the RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs.Error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the fact that BackgroundWorker has functionality which is easy to implement but even easier to wrongly implement in a subtle way, like cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal is to take advantage of as much of the current state as possible: that there is a connection between the two machines, that I'm authenticated on both, that I'm in the working directory of the file---so I don't have to open another terminal and copy and paste the remote host and path in, which is what I do now. The best solution also wouldn't require any setup before the session began, but if the setup was a one-time or able to be automated, than that's perfectly acceptable.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scratch that, this still applies, but I think what your doing is reading a configuration file and parsing it into this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;KeyValuePair&amp;lt;String,String&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; itemConfig = 
    new List&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;KeyValuePair&amp;lt;String,String&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, we can still use a reflection factory to instantiate the objects, I'd just pass in the nested inner list to it, instead of passing each individual key/value pair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OLD POST:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a clever little way to do this using reflection:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic idea:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a common base class for each Object class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put all of these classes in their own assembly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put this factory in that assembly too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pass in the KeyValuePair that you read from your config, and in return it finds the class that matches KV.Key and instantiates it with KV.Value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;   
      public class KeyValueToObjectFactory
      { 
         private Dictionary _kvTypes = new Dictionary();

        public KeyValueToObjectFactory()
        {
            // Preload the Types into a dictionary so we can look them up later
            // Obviously, you want to reuse the factory to minimize overhead, so don't
            // do something stupid like instantiate a new factory in a loop.

            foreach (Type type in typeof(KeyValueToObjectFactory).Assembly.GetTypes())
            {
                if (type.IsSubclassOf(typeof(KVObjectBase)))
                {
                    _kvTypes[type.Name.ToLower()] = type;
                }
            }
        }

        public KVObjectBase CreateObjectFromKV(KeyValuePair kv)
        {
            if (kv != null)
            {
                string kvName = kv.Key;

                // If the Type information is in our Dictionary, instantiate a new instance of that class.
                Type kvType;
                if (_kvTypes.TryGetValue(kvName, out kvType))
                {
                    return (KVObjectBase)Activator.CreateInstance(kvType, kv.Value);
                }
                else
                {
                    throw new ArgumentException("Unrecognized KV Pair");
                }
            }
            else
            {
                return null;
            }
        }
    }

  &lt;p&gt;The basic difference between UNION and UNION ALL is union operation eliminates the duplicated rows from the result set but union all returns all rows after joining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a performance hit when using UNION vs UNION ALL, since the database server must do additional work to remove the duplicate rows, but usually you do not want the duplicates (especially when developing reports).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;UNION Example:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT 'foo' AS bar UNION SELECT 'foo' AS bar

| bar |
+-----+
| foo |
+-----+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

&lt;h1&gt;UNION ALL example:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT 'foo' AS bar UNION ALL SELECT 'foo' AS bar
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

But I'm still rolling my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to second this question, and add my puzzlement that there is still no free, community-based tool for this problem.  Obviously, scripts are not a satisfactory way to maintain a database schema; neither are instances.  So, why don't we keep metadata in a separate (and while we're at it, platform-neutral) format?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's what I'm doing now.  My master database schema is a version-controlled XML file, created initially from a simple web service.  A simple javascript program compares instances against it, and a simple XSL transform yields the CREATE or ALTER statements.  It has limits, like &lt;a href="http://www.rikware.com/RikMigrations.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;RikMigrations&lt;/a&gt;; for instance it doesn't always sequence inter-depdendent objects correctly.  (But guess what &amp;#8212; neither does &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=56E5B1C5-BF17-42E0-A410-371A838E570A&amp;amp;displaylang=en" rel="nofollow"&gt;Microsoft's SQL Server Database Publication tool&lt;/a&gt;.)  Really, it's too simple.  I simply didn't include objects (roles, users, etc.) that I wasn't using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my view is that this problem is indeed inadequately addressed, and that sooner or later we'll have to get together and tackle the devilish details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MacOS X kernel does not directly dereference pointers from the user app anyway, as it resides its own separate address space. A user-space pointer in an ioctl call, for example, must first be resolved to its physical address and then a new virtual address created in the kernel address space. It doesn't really matter whether that pointer in the ioctl was 64 bits or 32 bits, the kernel does not dereference it directly in either case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So mixing a 32 bit kernel and 64 bit binaries can work, and vice-versa. The thing you cannot do is mix 32 bit libraries with a 64 bit application, as pointers passed between them would be truncated. MacOS X supplies more of its frameworks in both 32 and 64 bit versions in each release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;List comprehensions.  I often find myself filtering/mapping lists, and being able to say &lt;code&gt;[line.replace("spam","eggs") for line in open("somefile.txt") if line.startswith("nee")]&lt;/code&gt; is really nice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functions are first class objects.  They can be passed as parameters to other functions, defined inside other function, and have lexical scope.  This makes it really easy to say things like &lt;code&gt;people.sort(key=lambda p: p.age)&lt;/code&gt; and thus sort a bunch of people on their age without having to define a custom comparator class or something equally verbose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything is an object.  Java has basic types which aren't objects, which is why many classes in the standard library define 9 different versions of functions (for boolean, byte, char, double, float, int, long, Object, short).  &lt;code&gt;Array.sort&lt;/code&gt; is a good example.  Autoboxing helps, although it makes things awkward when something turns out to be null.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Properties.  Python lets you create classes with read-only fields, lazily-generated fields, as well as fields which are checked upon assignment to make sure they're never 0 or null or whatever you want to guard against, etc.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Default and keyword arguments.  In Java if you want a constructor that can take up to 5 optional arguments, you must define 6 different versions of that constructor.  And there's no way at all to say &lt;code&gt;Student(name="Eli", age=25)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functions can only return 1 thing.  In Python you have tuple assignment, so you can say &lt;code&gt;spam, eggs = nee()&lt;/code&gt; but in Java you'd need to either resort to mutable out parameters or have a custom class with 2 fields and then have two additional lines of code to extract those fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built-in syntax for lists and dictionaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operator Overloading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally better designed libraries.  For example, to parse an XML document in Java, you say&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Document doc = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance().newDocumentBuilder().parse("test.xml");&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
and in Python you say&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;doc = parse("test.xml")&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I could go on and on with further examples, but Python is just overall a much more flexible and expressive language.  It's also dynamically typed, which I really like, but which comes with some disadvantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java has much better performance than Python and has way better tool support.  Sometimes those things matter a lot and Java is the better language than Python for a task; I continue to use Java for some new projects despite liking Python a lot more.  But as a language I think Python is superior for most things I find myself needing to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;

behind that is that Dispose runs when called, whereas setting the object to
null simply adds a entry to the Finalize queue in GC, and we cannot
determine when GC will run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no performance benefit in implementing the Dispose method on types that use only managed resources (such as arrays) because they are automatically reclaimed by the garbage collector. Use the Dispose method primarily on managed objects that use native resources and on COM objects that are exposed to the .NET Framework. Managed objects that use native resources (such as the FileStream class) implement the IDisposable interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An elegant means of inoking Dispose that have adopted is using the "using" construct. For those of you who may not be familiar with the construct, it provide a means to implicity invoke Dispose() on an instance that implements IDisposable even if an exception is thrown durring the operation. The following is an example of the using construct: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;using(DisposableClass dc = new DisposableClass()) 
{ 
   dc.PerformActionOnUmanagedResources(); 
   dc.PerformAnotherActionOnUmanagedResources(); 
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous example, if an exception was thrown in the PerformActionOnUmanagedResources() method, although the PerformAnotherActionOnUmanagedResources() method would not be processed, the using block will still implicity invoke the Dispose method on dc ensuring the realese of any unmanaged resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The garbage collector looks for rooted objects, and circular dependencies don't prevent collection if neither object is rooted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a caveat: if object A has a reference to object B, and object B is being disposed, you may want to clean up that relationship or else you could end up with a leak. The most common place this surfaces is in event handlers (the reference from A-&gt;B is one that B controls, because it subscribed to an event on A). In this case, if A is still rooted, B cannot be collected even though it's been disposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Carl RE: Don't need a tool.  I agree that any form of code review is better than nothing.  I also agree that tools can sometimes cause less interaction, which reduces important effects like teaching and sharing.  However, in-person meetings-based reviews take tons of time, so typically you cannot do those on 100% of your check-ins.  Therefore, might I suggest that tool-based review is appropriate for the bulk of changes (so it can be done swiftly and without interruption), but that people should not be afraid to put down the tool and talk to one another &lt;em&gt;at any time&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, most of the things that the OS does wouldn't necessarily perform any faster running at 64 bits - the OS is not a heavy data processor, and those portions that are (streams, disk I/O, etc) are likely converted to 64 bit (plugins to the OS anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The schema has a version number - this is represented by a table which has one row per version which, as well as the version number, carries boring things like a date/time stamp for when that version came into existence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By having the schema create/modify DDL wrapped in code that performs the changes for us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context above one would build the schema change code as part of the build process then run it and it would only apply schema changes that haven't already been applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our experience (which is bound not to be representative) in most cases the schema changes are sufficiently small/fast that they can safely be run in a transaction which means that if it fails we get a rollback and the db is "safe" - although one would always recommend taking backups before applying schema updates if practicable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I evolved this out of nasty painful experience. Its not a perfect system (or an original idea) but as a result of working this way we have a high degree of confidence that if there are two instances of one of our databases with the same version that then the schema for those two databases will be the same in almost all respects and that we can safely bring any db up to the current schema for that application without ill effects. (That last isn't 100% true unfortunately - there's always an exception - but its not too far from the truth!)&lt;/p&gt;

The scheduling algorithm they outline (and is shown to be only about 1% worse than an optimal solution in tests) has an interesting way of scheduling tasks they call the LEDF Heuristic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the paper:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The low-energy earliest deadline rst
  heuristic, or simply LEDF, is an
  extension of the well-known earliest
  deadline rst (EDF) algorithm. The
  operation of LEDF is as follows: LEDF
  maintains a list of all released
  tasks, called the ready list. When
  tasks are released, the task with the
  nearest deadline is chosen to be
  executed. A check is performed to see
  if the task deadline can be met by
  executing it at the lower voltage
  (speed). If the deadline can be met,
  LEDF assigns the lower voltage to the
  task and the task begins execution.
  During the tasks execution, other
  tasks may enter the system. These
  tasks are assumed to be placed
  automatically on the ready list.
  LEDF again selects the task with the
  nearest deadline to be executed. As
  long as there are tasks waiting to be
  executed, LEDF does not keep the pro-
  cessor idle. This process is repeated
  until all the tasks have been
  scheduled.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in pseudo-code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Repeat forever {
    if tasks are waiting to be scheduled {
        Sort deadlines in ascending order
        Schedule task with earliest deadline
        Check if deadline can be met at lower speed (voltage)
        If deadline can be met,
            schedule task to execute at lower voltage (speed)
        If deadline cannot be met,
            check if deadline can be met at higher speed (voltage)
        If deadline can be met,
            schedule task to execute at higher voltage (speed)
        If deadline cannot be met,
            task cannot be scheduled: run the exception handler!
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that real-time scheduling is an interesting and evolving problem as small, low-power devices become more ubiquitous. I think this is an area in which we'll see plenty of further research and I look forward to keeping abreast!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;StringBuffer did share up to 1.4, but not since 5.0. Sharing has theoretical multi-threading problems. The 5.0 memory model (actually implemented by 1.4) adds final field semantics that correctly allow Strings to be immutable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would start with this set of articles:
&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x98tx3cf%28VS.71%29.aspx"&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x98tx3cf(VS.71).aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the quick summary of those articles.  First, include these headers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#define CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC
#include &amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;crtdbg.h&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you need to call this when your program exits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;_CrtDumpMemoryLeaks();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if your program does not exit in the same place every time, you can call this at the start of your program:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;_CrtSetDbgFlag ( _CRTDBG_ALLOC_MEM_DF | _CRTDBG_LEAK_CHECK_DF );
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when the program exits all the allocations that were not free'd will be printed in the Output Window along with the file they were allocated in and the allocation occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strategy works for most programs.  However, it becomes difficult or impossible in certain cases.  Using third party libraries that do some initialization on startup may cause other objects to appear in the memory dump and can make tracking down your leaks difficult.  Also, if any of your classes have members with the same name as any of the memory allocation routines( such as malloc ), the CRT debug macros will cause problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other techniques explained in the MSDN link referenced above that could be used as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've read the other thread about &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43500/is-there-a-built-in-method-to-compare-collections-in-c" rel="nofollow"&gt;Enumerable.SequenceEqual&lt;/a&gt;, but it's not exactly what I'm looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, two collections would be equal if they both contain the same items (no matter the order).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;collection1 = {1, 2, 3, 4};
collection2 = {2, 4, 1, 3};

collection1 == collection2; // true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I usually do is to loop through each item of one collection and see if it exists in the other collection, then loop through each item of the other collection and see if it exists in the first collection. (I start by comparing the lengths).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (collection1.Count != collection2.Count)
    return false; // the collections are not equal

foreach (Item item in collection1)
{
    if (!collection2.Contains(item))
        return false; // the collections are not equal
}

foreach (Item item in collection2)
{
    if (!collection1.Contains(item))
        return false; // the collections are not equal
}

return true; // the collections are equal
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this is not entirely correct, and it's probably not the most efficient way to do compare two collections for equality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example I can think of that would be wrong is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;collection1 = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}
collection2 = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which would be equal with my implementation. Should I just count the number of times each item is found and make sure the counts are equal in both collections?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The examples are in some sort of C# (let's call it pseudo-C#), but give your answer in whatever language you wish, it does not matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all of my SELECT queries were against views of only the current rows for each table (highest revision number).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views looked like this&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT
    dbo.tblBook.BookId,
    dbo.tblBook.RevisionId,
    dbo.tblBook.Title,
    dbo.tblBook.AuthorId,
    dbo.tblBook.Price,
    dbo.tblBook.Deleted
FROM
    dbo.tblBook INNER JOIN
    (
        SELECT
            BookId,
            MAX(RevisionId) AS RevisionId
        FROM
            dbo.tblBook
        GROUP BY
            BookId
    ) AS CurrentBookRevision ON
    dbo.tblBook.BookId = CurrentBookRevision.BookId AND
    dbo.tblBook.RevisionId = CurrentBookRevision.RevisionId
WHERE
    dbo.tblBook.Deleted = 0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my inserts (and updates and deletes) were all handled by stored procedures (one per table).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stored procedures looked like this&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ALTER procedure [dbo].[sp_Book_CreateUpdateDelete]
    @BookId      uniqueidentifier,
    @RevisionId  bigint,
    @Title       varchar(256),
    @AuthorId    uniqueidentifier,
    @Price       smallmoney,
    @Deleted     bit
as
    insert into tblBook
        (
            BookId,
            RevisionId,
            Title,
            AuthorId,
            Price,
            Deleted
        )
    values
        (

            @Price,
            @Deleted
        )
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revision numbers were handled per-transaction in the Visual Basic code&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Shared Sub Save(ByVal UserId As Guid, ByVal Explanation As String, ByVal Commands As Collections.Generic.Queue(Of SqlCommand))

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a system preserves all past versions of each row, but can be a real pain to manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total history preserved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fewer stored procedures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;relies on non-database application for data integrity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;huge amount of code to be written&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No foreign keys managed within database (goodbye automatic Linq-to-SQL-style object generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I still haven't come up with a good user interface to retrieve all that preserved past versioning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wouldn't go to such trouble on a new project without some easy-to-use out-of-the-box ORM solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm curious if the Microsoft Entity Framework can handle such database designs well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff and the rest of that Stack Overflow team must have had to deal with similar issues while developing Stack Overflow:  Past revisions of edited questions and answers are saved and retrievable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe Jeff has stated that his team used Linq to SQL and MS SQL Server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder how they handled these issues.&lt;/p&gt;

It was long ago available as "align" and "align0" in the FASTA package.  The difference was that the "0" version wasn't as biased about avoiding end-gapping, which often allowed favoring high-quality internal matches easier.  Smith-Waterman, I suspect you're aware, is a local aligner and is the original basis of BLAST.  FASTA had it's own local aligner as well that was slightly different.  All of these are essentially heuristic methods for estimating Levenshtein distance relevant to a scoring metric for individual character pairs (in bioinformatics, often given by Dayhoff/"PAM", Henikoff&amp;amp;Henikoff, or other matrices and usually replaced with something simpler and more reasonably reflective of replacements in linguistic word morphology when applied to natural language).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's not be precious about labels:  Levenshtein distance, as referenced in practice at least, is basically edit distance and you have to estimate it because it's not feasible to compute it generally, and it's expensive to compute exactly even in interesting special cases:  the water gets deep quick there, and thus we have heuristic methods of long and good repute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now as to your own problem:  several years ago, I had to check the accuracy of short DNA reads against reference sequence known to be correct and I came up with something I called "anchored alignments".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is to take your reference string set and "digest" it by finding all locations where a given N-character substring occurs.  Choose N so that the table you build is not too big but also so that substrings of length N are not too common.  For small alphabets like DNA bases, it's possible to come up with a perfect hash on strings of N characters and make a table and chain the matches in a linked list from each bin.  The list entries must identify the sequence and start position of the substring that maps to the bin in whose list they occur.  These are "anchors" in the list of strings to be searched at which an NW alignment is likely to be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When processing a query string, you take the N characters starting at some offset K in the query string, hash them, look up their bin, and if the list for that bin is nonempty then you go through all the list records and perform alignments between the query string and the search string referenced in the record.  When doing these alignments, you line up the query string and the search string &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; the anchor and extract a substring of the search string that is the same length as the query string and which contains that anchor at the same offset, K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you choose a long enough anchor length N, and a reasonable set of values of offset K (they can be spread across the query string or be restricted to low offsets) you should get a subset of possible alignments and often will get clearer winners.  Typically you will want to use the less end-biased align0-like NW aligner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method tries to boost NW a bit by restricting it's input and this has a performance gain because you do less alignments and they are more often between similar sequences.  Another good thing to do with your NW aligner is to allow it to give up after some amount or length of gapping occurs to cut costs, especially if you know you're not going to see or be interested in middling-quality matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, this method was used on a system with small alphabets, with K restricted to the first 100 or so positions in the query string and with search strings much larger than the queries (the DNA reads were around 1000 bases and the search strings were on the order of 10000, so I was looking for approximate substring matches justified by an estimate of edit distance specifically).  Adapting this methodology to natural language will require some careful thought:  you lose on alphabet size but you gain if your query strings and search strings are of similar length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, allowing more than one anchor from different ends of the query string to be used simultaneously might be helpful in further filtering data fed to NW.  If you do this, be prepared to possibly send overlapping strings each containing one of the two anchors to the aligner and then reconcile the alignments... or possibly further modify NW to emphasize keeping your anchors mostly intact during an alignment using penalty modification during the algorithm's execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this is helpful or at least interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there an alternative to using SvcUtil's command line step back in time to generate the proxy? With ASMX services a test harness was automatically provided; is there a good alternative today with WCF? &lt;/p&gt;

That book's precursor (and a little better organized, but not much, as a tutorial) is Michele Leroux Bustamante's Learning WCF.

Does anyone have any recommendations on a key storage solution or method?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your replies, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;spoulson, the issue is actually both the "scopes" that you mentioned. I suppose I should have been clearer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data itself, as well as the logic that encrypts it and decrypts it is abstracted away into an ASP.NET profile provider. This profile provider allows both encrypted profile properties as well as plain text ones. The encrypted property values are stored in exactly the same way the plain text ones are - with the obvious exception that they've been encrypted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the key will need to be able to be summoned for one of three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The authorized web application, running on an authorized server, needs to encrypt data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Same as #1, but for decrypting the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authorized members of our business team need to view the encrypted data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I'm imagining it is that nobody would ever actually know the key - there would be a piece of software controlling the actual encrypting and decrypting of data. That said, the key still needs to come from &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure - if you couldn't already tell, I've never done anything like this before, so if I'm completely off base in my perception of how this should work, by all means, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see why it shouldn't be completely free to transfer the license -- there is some (probably 'nominal') administrative work to do on the vendor's side, and they need to discourage people from transferring licenses all over the place when they really shouldn't be.  But 25% seems awfully high for the amount of work and verification they need to do -- it seems like they could put some sort of cap on the license transfer fee, or have a fixed price.&lt;/p&gt;

A more subtle benefit is that aggregate actions can be contained within a single Undo too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, you have two stacks of memento objects. One for Undo, the other for Redo. Every operation creates a new memento, which ideally will be some calls to change the state of your model, document (or whatever). This gets added to the undo stack. When you do an undo operation, in addition to executing the Undo action on the Memento object to change the model back again, you also pop the object off the Undo stack and push it right onto the Redo stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How the method to change the state of your document is implemented depends completely on your implementation. If you can simply make an API call (e.g. ChangeColour(r,g,b)), then precede it with a query to get and save the corresponding state. But the pattern will also support making deep copies, memory snapshots, temp file creation etc - it's all up to you as it is is simply a virtual method implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do aggregate actions (e.g. user Shift-Selects a load of objects to do an operation on, such as delete, rename, change attribute), your code creates a new Undo stack as a single memento, and passes that to the actual operation to add the individual operations to. So your action methods don't need to (a) have a global stack to worry about and (b) can be coded the same whether they are executed in isolation or as part of one aggregate operation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many undo systems are in-memory only, but you could persist the undo stack out if you wish, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I'm looking for is a way to make the data only editable if they are using the compiled .mde file I distribute to them. I know I can make the data read only for the general population, and editable for select users. &lt;/p&gt;

Yes, it's using forms. What I'm looking to do is just have it switch users once when I have my launchpad/mainmenu form pop up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Peter,&lt;br&gt;
That is indeed the direction I'm headed. What I haven't determined was how to go about switching to that second ID. I'm not so worried about the password being sniffed, the users are all internal, and on an internal LAN. If they can sniff that password, they can certainly sniff the one for my privileged ID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@no one in general,&lt;br&gt;
Right now its security by obscurity. I've given the uses a special .mdb for doing reporting that will let them read data, but not update it. They don't know about relinking to the tables through the ODBC connection. A slightly more ms-access/DB literate user could by pass what I've done in seconds - and there a few who imagine themselves to be DBA, so they will figure it out eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

li { counter-increment: myCounter; }
li:before { content: counter(myCounter)". "; display: marker; width: 5em; text-align: right; marker-offset: 1em; }

&lt;p&gt;But this doesn't seem to generate markers, in either FF3, Chrome, or IE8 beta 2, and if I recall correctly not Opera either (although I've since uninstalled Opera).&lt;/p&gt;

  generally, a directory can contain

SDL lets you get user input in a reasonable way, but seems to force you to create a window, which is troublesome if you have abstracted control so the control machine doesn't have to be the same as the render machine.  However, if the control and render machines are the same, this results in an ugly little SDL window on top of your display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit To Clarify&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
The renderer has an output window, in its normal use case, that window is full screen, except when they are both running on the same computer, just so it is possible to give the controller focus. There can actually be multiple renderers displaying a different view of the same data on different computers all controlled by the same controller, hence the total decoupling of the input from the output (Making taking advantage of the built in X11 client/server stuff for display less useable)  Also, multiple controller applications for one renderer is also possible.  Communication between the controllers and renderers is via sockets.&lt;/p&gt;

The ASMX services were pretty Microsofty. Not to say that they didn't try to be compatible with other consumers; but the model wasn't made to fit much besides ASP.NET web pages and some other custom Microsoft consumers. Whereas WCF, because of its architecture, allows your service to have very open-standard--based endpoints, e.g. REST, JSON, etc. in addition to the usual SOAP. Other people will probably have a much easier time consuming your WCF service than your ASMX one.&lt;/p&gt;

You don't even have to create three seperate projects, you can just create 3 seperate folders within the web app and give each one a namespace like, YourCompany.YourApp.Domain, YourCompany.YourApp.Data, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big advantage is having a more flexible solution.  If you start writing your app as a data centric application, strongly coupling your web forms pages to datasets, you are going to end up doing a lot more work later migrating to a more domain centeric model as your business logic grows in complexity.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe in the short term you focus on a simple solution by creating very simple domain objects and populating them from datasets, then you can add business logic to them as needed and build out a more sophisticated ORM as needed, or use nhibernate.&lt;/p&gt;

But there is important advantage I would like to mention to the command pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When implementing undo/redo using the command pattern, you can avoid large amounts of duplicated code by abstracting (to a degree) the operations performed on the data and utilize those operations in the undo/redo system.  For example in a text editor cut and paste are complementary commands (aside from the management of the clipboard).  In other words, the undo operation for a cut is paste and the undo operation for a paste is cut.  This applies to much simpler operations as typing and deleting text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key here is that you can use your undo/redo system as the primary command system for your editor.  Instead of writing the system such as "create undo object, modify the document" you can "create undo object, execute redo operation on undo object to modify the document".  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, admittedly, many people are thinking to themselves "Well duh, isn't part of the point of the command pattern?"  Yes, but I've seen too many command systems that have two sets of commands, one for immediate operations and another set for undo/redo.  I'm not saying that there won't be commands that are specific to immediate operations and undo/redo, but reducing the duplication will make the code more maintainable.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Because so many operating systems already have integrated WebDAV clients, the use case for this feature borders on fantastical: imagine an office of ordinary users running Microsoft Windows or Mac OS. Each user mounts the Subversion repository, which appears to be an ordinary network folder. They use the shared folder as they always do: open files, edit them, save them. Meanwhile, the server is automatically versioning everything. Any administrator (or knowledgeable user) can still use a Subversion client to search history and retrieve older versions of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might want to add &lt;code&gt;sort -g&lt;/code&gt; at the end to get the libraries in order of usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that you probably get lines two non-library lines with the above command. One of static executables ("not a dynamic executable") and one without any library. The latter is the result of &lt;code&gt;linux-gate.so.1&lt;/code&gt; which is not a library in your file system but one "supplied" by the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If using TortoiseSVN directly is too difficult, I have had good experiences with setting up a Samba file share where all project documents are stored and automatically synchronizing this with Subversion. You lose the benefits of people writing comments on their commits, but in many cases automatic version history is better than no version history. This way the people involved don't even have to be aware of the version tracking, as long as they save their documents in the right place. How often you need to synchronize depends on how often documents are changed, but in my case a synchronization every 24 hours was adequate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: To implement this I had to write a custom script that checked out the latest version from the repository, compared it with the local copy and issued &lt;code&gt;svn&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;cvs&lt;/code&gt;) commands to add, remove and update any changed files. I'm not sure if there exists a general (open source) solution to do this, but I don't think it should be too hard to implement yourself anyway (I wrote a simple script to do it in a few hours).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I've found that this gives a different definition of "% of CPU Utilization" than I'd like - according to the manpages for ps, &lt;code&gt;pcpu&lt;/code&gt; is defined as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;cpu utilization of the process in "##.#" format. It is the CPU time used divided by the time the process has been running (cputime/realtime ratio), expressed as a percentage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, &lt;code&gt;pcpu&lt;/code&gt; gives me the % CPU utilization for the process for the &lt;em&gt;lifetime&lt;/em&gt; of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I want to take a sample every X seconds, I'd like to be collecting the CPU utilization of the process at the current time only - similar to what &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt; would give me
(CPU utilization of the process since the last update). &lt;/p&gt;

WDDX: 47ms
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the data structure I'm serializing is fairly complex, it could easily be considered small. This should make the efficiency of JSON serialization over WDDX even more preferrable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Attempts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gmail Style&lt;/em&gt;: You can use javascript to add new Upload elements (input type='file'), then upload them all at once with the click of a button. This works, but still requires a lot of clicks. (I was able to use an invisible ActiveX control to detect things like File Size, which would be useful.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flash Uploader&lt;/em&gt;: I discovered a couple of Flash Upload controls that use a 1x1 flash file to act as the uploader, callable by javascript. (One such control is &lt;a href="http://digitarald.de/project/fancyupload/" rel="nofollow"&gt;FancyUpload&lt;/a&gt;, another is &lt;a href="http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2008/09/02/the-dojo-toolkit-multi-file-uploader/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dojo's Multiple File Uploader&lt;/a&gt;, yet another is one by &lt;a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/aspnet/FlashUpload.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;darick_c at CodeProject&lt;/a&gt;.) These excited me, but I quickly ran into two issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flash 10 will break the functionality that is used to call the multiple file upload dialogue box. The workaround is to use a transparent flash frame, or just use a flash button to call the dialogue box. That's not a huge deal. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The integrated windows authentication used on our intranet is not used when the Flash file attempts to upload the files, prompting the user for credentials. The workaround for this is to use cookieless sessions, which would be a nightmare for our project due to several other reasons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Java Uploader&lt;/em&gt;: I noticed several Java-based multiple-file uploaders, but most of the appear to cost money. If I found one that worked really well, I could arrange to purchase it. I'd just rather not. I also don't like the look of most of them. I liked FancyUpload because it interacted with html/javascript so that I could easily style and manage it any way I want. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ActiveX Uploader&lt;/em&gt;: I found &lt;a href="http://support.persits.com/xupload/demo1.asp" rel="nofollow"&gt;an ActiveX solution&lt;/a&gt; as well. It appears that ActiveX will work. I would just write my own instead of buying that one. This will be my last resort, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to be able to use something like FancyUpload. If I can just get by the credentials prompt some way, it would be perfect. But, from my research, it appears that the only real workaround is cookieless sessions, which I just can't do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the question is: Is there a way to resolve the issues presented above OR is there a different solution that I have not listed which accomplishes the same goal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I want to make sure that the validator functions properly with respect to Page.IsValid.  The only way I know to do this is to override &lt;strong&gt;BaseValidator&lt;/strong&gt; and implement &lt;code&gt;EvaluateIsValid()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my question is, how would you suggest structuring this control?  Is inheriting from BaseValidator the best (only) way to get the validator part right, or can I do that in some other way?&lt;/p&gt;

We had the same sorts of problems with merging that Ben Schierman mentioned, along with other buggy behavior that pushed us toward Subversion.&lt;/p&gt;

Most of the projects are internal and will not require massive amounts of concurrency and all will go against SQL Server.  I've suggested that they go with ORM tools like SubSonic, NHibernate, and a number of other open source projects out there, but for maintainability and flexibility reasons they want to create something custom.  So my question is this: What are some features that I should make sure to include in this ORM tool?  BTW, I'll be using MyGeneration to do the code generation templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, the real reason a modern machine starts running slow is due to everything from malware to virus scanners: Mcafee, Norton's, etc are prime targets in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the WinSXS folder tends to grow as service packs and applications are installed.  This seems to have a negative impact on system performance.  There are only two possible solutions in this scenario.  First, if possible, reinstall the OS with the latest service pack already slipstreamed into the install.  Second, if that isn't possible AND you are running Vista with SP1, you can run the vsp1cln.exe tool (see &lt;a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc766219.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;technet&lt;/a&gt;) which will clean up a lot of the older versions of components.

  &lt;p&gt;But if you're using GNU Emacs 21.2
  (the latest version, which includes
  this as part of the standard distro),
  you can just put the following lines
  into your .emacs file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;;; recentf stuff
(require 'recentf)
(recentf-mode 1)
(setq recentf-max-menu-items 25)
(global-set-key "\C-x\ \C-r" 'recentf-open-files)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Then, when you launch emacs, hit
  &lt;kbd&gt;CTRL&lt;/kbd&gt;-&lt;kbd&gt;X&lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;kbd&gt;CTRL&lt;/kbd&gt;-&lt;kbd&gt;R&lt;/kbd&gt;. It will show a list of
  the recently-opened files in a buffer.
  Move the cursor to a line and press
  &lt;kbd&gt;ENTER&lt;/kbd&gt;. That will open the file in
  question, and move it to the top of
  your recent-file list.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;(Note: Emacs records file names.
  Therefore, if you move or rename a
  file outside of Emacs, it won't
  automatically update the list. You'll
  have to open the renamed file with the
  normal &lt;kbd&gt;CTRL&lt;/kbd&gt;-&lt;kbd&gt;X&lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;kbd&gt;CTRL&lt;/kbd&gt;-&lt;kbd&gt;F&lt;/kbd&gt; method.)&lt;/p&gt;

  including screenshots&lt;/a&gt; of how this
  package works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; You don't need the &lt;code&gt;(require 'recentf)&lt;/code&gt; line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You install a custom filter into django which gets the key of your dict as a parameter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make it work in google app-engine you need to add a file to your main directory,
I called mine *django_hack.py* which contains this little piece of code&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;from google.appengine.ext import webapp

register = webapp.template.create_template_register()

def hash(h,key):

register.filter(hash)

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have this file, all we need to do is tell the app-engine to use it...
we do that by adding this little line to your main file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;webapp.template.register_template_library('django_hack')
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Hello, currently we don't have plans
  to support Chrome. We will support it
  in the future if it gains enough
  market share. Please understand, each
  browser implements the plug-in model
  differently, so it'll be a lot of
  effort to officially support a browser
  100%... By the way, IE 8 also runs
  each tab in its own process. If a tab
  crashes, other tabs will still work
  fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would an address in the Bronx include the borough as a level in the hierarchy? Would an address in an unincorporated area eliminate the "city" level of the hierarchy? How do you model an address within a university vs an address that's not within one? You'll end up with a ragged hierarchy which will force you to traverse the tree every time you need to display an address in your application. If you have an "address book" page the performance hit could be significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure that you even have just one hierarchy. Brown University has facilities in Providence, RI and Bristol, RI. The only clean solution would be to have a double hierarchy with two campuses that each belong to their respective cities in one hierarchy but that both belong to Brown University on the other hierarchy. (A university is fundamentally unlike a political region. You shouldn't really mix them.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about zip codes? Some zip codes encompass multiple towns, other times a city is broken into multiple zip codes. And (rarely) some zip codes even cross state lines. (According to Wikipedia, at least...)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How will you enter the data? Building out the database by parsing conventionally-formatted addresses can be difficult when you take into account vanity addresses, alternate names for certain streets, different international formats, etc. And I think that entering every address hierarchically would be a PITA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sounds like you're trying to model the entire world in your application. Do you really want or need to maintain a table that could conceivable contain every city, state, province, postal code, and country in the world? (Or at least every one where you know somebody?) The only thing I can think of that this scheme would buy you is proximity, but if that's what you want I'd just store state and country separately (and maybe the zip code) and add latitude and longitude data from Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the extreme pessimism, but I've gone down that road myself. It's logically beautiful and elegant, but it doesn't work so well in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also:  in VB.Net array declarations work a little differently.  The subscript you specify in the declaration is the last index, not the number of items created like with C# or C++.   But the array is still 0-indexed like C# or C++, instead of 1-indexed like VB6.  That means that if you move to VB.Net from a different language your array instincts are probably wrong, no matter which language it is.  In VB.Net, &lt;em&gt;Dim arr(3,3) As Integer&lt;/em&gt; actually creates a &lt;strong&gt;4x4&lt;/strong&gt; array. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming its the first:  That's where the code is executing from.  When you debug the program, its compiled and the binaries are placed under the project's \bin\debug directory.  When you're testing, you're running the test's binaries, which are compiled and placed under the test project's bin\debug directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming its the last:  Possibly some obscure reason, possibly a bug, or possibly to catch people who are concatenating paths rather than using Path.Combine (naughty naughty!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I don't know why it's different.  Test applications may be run within a custom CLR host; I think this may be the case as test apps do some weird stuff with private accessors that normally aren't allowed within the standard CLR host.  I'm only grasping at straws here as I don't have any actual knowledge about how this stuff is actually being coded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, the workaround stands (Path.Combine).  Nobody should be concatenating paths, as path delimeters can change.&lt;/p&gt;

Once a row is loaded from the DB, any subsequent fetches for a row with the same PK will return the data from this cache. Furthermore, Hibernate gaurentees reference equality for objects with the same PK in a single Session. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I understand, your read-only server application never closes its Hibernate session. So when the DB gets updated by the read-write application, the Session on read-only server is unaware of the change. Effectively, your read-only application is loading an in-memory copy of the database and using that copy, which gets stale in due course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplest and best course of action I can suggest is to close and open Sessions as needed. This sidesteps the whole problem. Hibernate Sessions are intended to be a window for a short-lived interaction with the DB. I agree that there is a performance gain by not reloading the object-graph again and again; but you need to measure it and convince yourself that it is worth the pains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option is to close and reopen the Session periodically. This ensures that the read-only application works with data not older than a given time interval. But there definitely is a window where the read-only application works with stale data (although the design guarantees that it gets the up-to-date data eventually). This might be permissible in many applications - you need to evaluate your situation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third option is to use a &lt;i&gt;second level cache&lt;/i&gt; implementation, and use short-lived Sessions. There are various caching packages that work with Hibernate with relative merits and demerits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds like a completely different approach is in order. My previous one was basically using the VS2008 Windows Forms designer to create, I guess, a pixel-based layout. I can see that if I were to stick with Windows Forms, &lt;code&gt;FlowLayoutPanel&lt;/code&gt;s would be helpful, although I've found them rather inflexible in the past. They also don't solve the problem where the containers (e.g. the form itself) aren't big enough; presumably there's a way to do that? Maybe that &lt;code&gt;AutoSize&lt;/code&gt; property?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might also be a sign that it's time to jump ship to WPF; I'm under the impression that it's specifically designed for this kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic issue seems to come down to these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I were to stick with Windows Forms, what are all the tricks to achieving a font-size-independent layout that can survive the user setting his fonts large, or setting the display to 120 DPI?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does WPF have significant advantages here, and if so, can you try to convince me that it's worth the switch?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there any general "best-practices" for font-size-independent layouts, either in the .NET stack or in general?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is bad for the company, of course, but the tool vender especially doesn't want this to happen - they lose a potential full-price customer for software where there is no real competitor.  Further, the company that originally purchased the tool doesn't mind the contract because it helps prevent acquisitions based only on getting the capital.  (Corollary:  If your company is negotiating out of such a contract, get ready to be purchased...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For tools that are very, very expensive, this is not unheard of.  Think 10's of thousands of dollars per seat, and you can see why this economy becomes reality.  Further, sometimes tools are purchased for the company by a client (DoD) and they are actually a small company ( a few developers that won a nice contract) - if the client does not retain the license, then the company might go bust and the license sold for pennies on the dollar at an auction to pay creditors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Etc, etc, etc.  In short, very, very expensive licenses change the economic playground enough that very strange rules apply.  Note that "expensive" may also mean scarce, as in the case of liquor licenses for restaurants, or otherwise difficult to get (Qualcomm might not want to sell a given company a license for their CDMA patents, but they may not be able to legally prevent that company from acquiring such a license through legal methods).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
ds.jndi=java:comp/env/jdbc/tcds

&lt;p&gt;In that case, you have two obvious choices:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical: Write to USB drive, burn to CD, etc.  Store in physically secure location.  But you run into the recursive problem: where do you store the key to the vault?  Typically, you delegate 2 or more people (or a team) to hold the keys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software: &lt;a href="http://www.cyber-ark.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cyber-Ark&lt;/a&gt; Private Ark is what my company uses to store its secret digital information.  We store all our admin passwords, license keys, private keys, etc.  It works by running a Windows "vault" server that is not joined to a domain, firewalls all ports except its own, and stores all its data encrypted on disk.  Users access through a web interface that first authenticates the user, then securely communicates with the vault server via explorer-like interface.  All changes and versions are logged.  But, this also has the same recursive problem... a master admin access CD.  This is stored in our physical vault with limited access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can iterate over records in the given period, and fill an array, where each bucket of the array corresponds to 1 second in the overall period. This works and seems to be fast, but if the timeperiod is big (say..1 year), I would need lots of memory (3600x24x365x4 bytes ~ 120MB aprox).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By simultaneous, I mean all calls on a given second. Second would be my minimum unit. I cannot use something bigger (hour for example) becuse all calls during an hour do not need to be held at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

Or rather, you would need to pick a size, and if you ended up needing more then you would have to allocate a new, larger, array, copy the data from the old one into the new one, and continue on as before (until you exceed the size of the new one...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, you would go with one of the collection classes - ArrayList, List&amp;lt;&gt;, LinkedList&amp;lt;&gt;, etc. - which one depends a lot on what you're looking for; List will give you the closest thing to what i described initially, while LinkedList&amp;lt;&gt; will avoid the problem of frequent re-allocations (at the cost of slower access and greater memory usage). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;float[]&amp;gt; _calibrationSet = new List&amp;lt;float[]&amp;gt;();

This speeds up building the array a good deal by making reallocation cheaper, but can have an impact on access speed (and, of course, memory usage). Whether this is an issue for you depends a lot on what you'll be doing with the data after it's loaded... and whether there are two hundred records or two million records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes/Caveats: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the function/class is namespaced, the string must contain the fully-qualified name. E.g. &lt;code&gt;['Vendor\Package\Foo', 'method']&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;call_user_func&lt;/code&gt; does not support passing non-objects by reference, so you can either use &lt;code&gt;call_user_func_array&lt;/code&gt; or, in later PHP versions, save the callback to a var and use the direct syntax: &lt;code&gt;$cb()&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objects with an &lt;a href="http://us2.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php#language.oop5.magic.invoke" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;code&gt;__invoke()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method (including anonymous functions) fall under the category "callable" and can be used the same way, but I personally don't associate these with the legacy "callback" term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The legacy &lt;code&gt;create_function()&lt;/code&gt; creates a global function and returns its name. It's a wrapper for &lt;code&gt;eval()&lt;/code&gt; and anonymous functions should be used instead.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are using pixels for your form entities, and points (basically inches) to specify font size.  Pixels and points are related by DPI, so you change the DPI and suddenly your pixel fixed values don't line up with your point fixed values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are packages and classes for this, but at the end of the day you must choose one unit or the other, or scale one of the units according to the changing constant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I'd change the entities on the form into inches.  I'm not a C# person, so I don't know if this is supported natively, or if you have to perform some dynamic form sizing on application startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have to do this in your software,  then go ahead and size everything normally (say, to your usual 96 DPI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your application starts, verify the system is at 96 DPI before you show your forms.  If it is, great.  If not, then set a variable with the correction factor, and scale and translate (modify both the location and size) of each entity before you show the form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate, though, would be to specify everything in inches or points (a point is 1/72 of an inch) and let the OS deal with it.  You might have to deal with corner cases (an outdoor screen with a correctly set DPI would show your application in a few pixels...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;em&gt;converted&lt;/em&gt; to an unsigned integer by adding &lt;code&gt;UINT_MAX + 1&lt;/code&gt;, then the addition will be carried out with the unsigned values, resulting in a large &lt;code&gt;result&lt;/code&gt; (depending on the values of &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long Answer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the C99 Standard:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;6.3.1.8 Usual arithmetic conversions&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If both operands have the same type, then no further conversion is needed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Otherwise, if both operands have signed integer types or both have unsigned integer types, the operand with the type of lesser integer conversion rank is converted to the type of the operand with greater rank.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Otherwise, if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand, then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Otherwise, if the type of the operand with signed integer type can represent all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned integer type, then the operand with unsigned integer type is converted to the type of the operand with signed integer type.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Otherwise, both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type corresponding to the type of the operand with signed integer type.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your case, we have one unsigned int (&lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;) and signed int (&lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;). Referring to (3) above, since both operands have the same rank, your &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; will need to be &lt;em&gt;converted&lt;/em&gt; to an unsigned integer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;6.3.1.3 Signed and unsigned integers&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When a value with integer type is converted to another integer type other than _Bool, if the value can be represented by the new type, it is unchanged.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Otherwise, if the new type is unsigned, the value is converted by repeatedly adding or subtracting one more than the maximum value that can be represented in the new type until the value is in the range of the new type.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Otherwise, the new type is signed and the value cannot be represented in it; either the result is implementation-defined or an implementation-defined signal is raised.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we need to refer to (2) above. Your &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; will be converted to an unsigned value by adding &lt;code&gt;UINT_MAX + 1&lt;/code&gt;. So the result will depend on how &lt;code&gt;UINT_MAX&lt;/code&gt; is defined on your implementation. It will be large, but it will not overflow, because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;6.2.5 (9)&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;A computation involving unsigned operands can never overflow, because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus: Arithmetic Conversion Semi-WTF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;

int main(void)
{
  unsigned int plus_one = 1;
  int minus_one = -1;

  if(plus_one &amp;lt; minus_one)
    printf("1 &amp;lt; -1");
  else
    printf("boring");

  return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use this link to try this online: &lt;a href="http://codepad.org/yPhYCMFO"&gt;http://codepad.org/yPhYCMFO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus: Arithmetic Conversion Side Effect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arithmetic conversion rules can be used to get the value of &lt;code&gt;UINT_MAX&lt;/code&gt; by initializing an unsigned value to &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt;, ie:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;unsigned int umax = -1; // umax set to UINT_MAX
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is guaranteed to be portable regardless of the signed number representation of the system because of the conversion rules described above. See this SO question for more information: &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/809227/is-it-safe-to-use-1-to-set-all-bits-to-true"&gt;Is it safe to use -1 to set all bits to true?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

All functions don't need unit tests, and some would argue that unit testing individual functions at all is down-right wrong in many scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I recommend unit testing actual "units of functionality". Instead of writing a single test for each function, write a test for each scenario or feature. Besides saving you lots of time and allowing you to slip in the tests in under the radar, it is often far more accurate because it literally tests the functions they way they are being used. Too often function by function unit tests don't test the right thing, or even worse, test mocks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend you avoid using mocks in testing at all costs. The use of a mock essentially invalidates the test because you are testing how it works in idealized circumstances instead of how it works in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A side benefit is that you also get better dead-code detection. Any code that isn't covered by a high level test probably isn't being used and can be removed. Never underestimate the value of eliminating dead code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you are going to be casting back and forth, I would strongly advise naming your variables such that it is clear what type they are, eg:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int iValue, iResult;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize my arguments against the common complaints:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clean-up is invisible to users; we need to add new features.&lt;/strong&gt;
The bugs constantly produced by messy code are visible to users too. Time spent fixing those bugs could have been spent adding features. The longer we stay in quality debt, the more time it takes to add each new feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We don't have time for clean-up.&lt;/strong&gt;
You'd rather spend your time fixing bugs generated by the problem rather than fixing the problem? That's like whacking weeds every weekend instead of pulling them up by the roots. Prevention is sixteen times more valuable than cure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developers got themselves into this mess; they should get themselves out of it on their own time.&lt;/strong&gt;
Had developers not gotten releases out the door as fast as they did, had they not responded so swiftly to early adopter feedback, even when the product morphed into a beast quite different from its original conception, we wouldn't have our current customers and revenue. We'd be working for another company, not complaining about the software we built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attention CEO's: Finger-pointing impedes resolution. Instead, challenge your developers to reduce bug reports. This is easily measured, so you can track time versus results. Remember, developers prefer implementing new features to fixing bugs, so if they're begging for time to fix bugs, it's serious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@mats is very correct that there is always the potential for "hard" failures - finally blocks shouldn't include mission critical code, which should always be done transactionally inside the try{}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@mats again - The real beauty is that it allows you throw exceptions back out of your own methods, and still guarantee that you tidy up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;try
{
StreamReader stream = new StreamReader("foo.bar");
mySendSomethingToStream(stream);
}
catch(noSomethingToSendException e) {
    //Swallow this    
    logger.error(e.getMessage());
}
catch(anotherTypeOfException e) {
    //More serious, throw this one back
    throw(e);
}
finally
{
stream.close();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we can catch many types of exception, process them differently (the first allows execution for anything beyond the try{}, the second effectively returns), but always neatly and tidily clear up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely do the logging in flat file and add munge scripts to turn it into XMl later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First suggestion would be to make sure that all date/time strings are in ISO 8601 format, namely YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second is to make your categories, e.g. exception, fatal, error, warning, info, etc. really stand out in your logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then aybe look at some of the vim syntax files and create a new syntax for your log format so that important log entries really stand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not really that hard to take one of the standard syntax files and modify it to handle your log strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In WPF it's a lot easier because the concept of auto-sizing controls is built-in; in most cases if you are placing a WPF element by using a coordinate pair you are doing it wrong.

&lt;p&gt;To do it on the client, you just need to edit your app.config file with a new endpoint with a different name, then define when you create your new client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example if you have an endpoint in your client app like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;endpoint address="https://yourdomain.com/WCF/YourService.svc"

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;YourServiceClient client = new YourServiceClient();

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;user education, and &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that all we can do? What about distributed tools to make it easy for casual users to do openid delegation? (Say, something integrated with OS X / Windows / Ubuntu) Are there technological barriers that make this infeasible?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If client-side (and vendor-issued) applications could let you manage your on-line security preference, then we'd possibly be able to combat &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the risks associated with giving random sites your passwords -- since the "login area" would be some local program sitting in your systray, or what not.  Of course, the integration of web apps with the desktop (such as that provided by Chrome) may make such a distinction impossible in practice, so it may be a moot point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, it seems like there should be something we could do &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; to make openid more palatable to the general public, and speed adoption in addition to making the system more user friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm aware that the descriptions aren't hugely clear, so I'll try to summarise what I'm attempting as best I can here.  The application is a personal finance program.  Further background on the framework itself is available at the end of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of different types of plug-in that the framework can handle (e.g., accounts, export, reporting, etc.).  However, I'm focussing on one particular class of plug-in, so-called data plug-ins, as it is this class that is causing me problems.  I have one class of data plug-in for accounts, one for transactions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm midway through a vast re-factoring that has left me with the following architecture for data plug-ins:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data plug-in object (implementing intialisation, installation and plug-in metadata) [implements &lt;code&gt;IDataPlugin&amp;lt;FactoryType&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;]  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data object (such as an account) [implements, e.g., &lt;code&gt;IAccount&lt;/code&gt;]  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A factory to create instances of the data object [implements, e.g., &lt;code&gt;IAccountFactory&lt;/code&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously the data object and the plug-in object were combined into one, but this meant that a new transaction plug-in had to be instantiated for each transaction recorded in the account which caused a number of problems.  Unfortunately, that re-factoring has broken my message passing.  The data object implements &lt;code&gt;INotifyPropertyChanged&lt;/code&gt;, and so I've hit a new problem, and one that I'm not sure how to work around: the plug-in object is registering events with the message broker, but it's the data objects that actually fire the events.  This means that &lt;strong&gt;the subscribing plug-in currently has to subscribe to each created account, transaction, etc.!&lt;/strong&gt;  This is clearly not scalable.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell at the moment I have two possible solutions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the data plug-in object a go-between for the data-objects and message broker, possibly batching change notifications.  I don't like this because it adds another layer of complexity to the messaging system that I feel I should be able to do without.   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Junk the current event-based implementation and use something else that's more easily manageable (in-memory WCF?!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I guess I'm really asking: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How would you solve this problem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What potential solutions do you think I've overlooked?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is my approach even vaguely on-track/sensible?! :-)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you will be able to tell from the dates of the blog posts, some variant of this problem has been taxing me for quite a long time now!  As such, any and all responses will be greatly appreciated.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The background to the framework itself is as follows:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My plug-in framework consists of three main components: a plug-in broker, a preferences manager and a message broker.  The plug-in broker does the bread-and-butter plug-in stuff: discovering and creating plug-ins.  The preferences manager manages user preferences for the framework and individual plug-ins, such as which plug-ins are enabled, where data should be saved, etc.  Communication is via publish/subscribe, with the message broker sitting in the middle, gathering all published message types and managing subscriptions.  The publish/subscribe is currently implemented via the .NET &lt;code&gt;INotifyPropertyChanged&lt;/code&gt; interface, which provides one event called &lt;code&gt;PropertyChanged&lt;/code&gt;; the message broker builds a list of all plug-ins implementing &lt;code&gt;INotifyPropertyChanged&lt;/code&gt; and subscribes other plug-ins this event.  The purpose of the message passing is to allow the account and transaction plug-ins to notify the storage plug-ins that data has changed so that it may be saved.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I want to include each query entered in the XML as a comment, but the DBUnit API to generate the XML file doesn't support inserting the comment where I would like it (above the data it generates), so I am resorting to putting the comment with ALL queries either at the top or bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question: is it valid XML to place it at either location?  For example, above the XML Declaration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Queries used: ... --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?&amp;gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;dataset&amp;gt;
  ...

&amp;lt;!-- Queries used: ... --&amp;gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Comments can be placed anywhere in the tree, including in the text if the content of the element is text or #PCDATA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to post back if this works, but it would be nice to know if it is an official XML standard.&lt;/p&gt;

Telnet is usually thought of as a character-at-a-time protocol, so when you say "incoming messages" do you mean each character is a message?  Or the entire user's session is a message?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll make some assumtions.
You have users logging in via telnet and you want to capture everything they do while they are logged in.  Later, you want to be able to associate the stuff they did with that user and the time and date they did it.  You'll need to be able to search later to find out "who did 'rm *' as root?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would store each user's session as a separate file, with a naming convention that includes the user's login and a timestamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e.g. 2008_09_08_14_52_07_nidonocu&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the the file, I would capture each byte received, assuming they will mostly be plain text characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e.g.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ls
cd www
ls
vi index.html
/copyright 2007
llllllllllllr8:wq
exit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write the 8-bit ANSI characters to the file as well.  You should be able to use a text editor and grep to do basic audits and searches.  You could use a binary file viewer or get more sophisticated later if you need to actually read the 8-bit data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backups, archiving, purging, etc. can all be done using regular file system tools and scripting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My apologies if my assumptions are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;document    ::=     prolog  element  Misc*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which means that, if you want to have comments at the top, you cannot have an XML type declaration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specification agrees with Wikipedia on comments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2.5 Comments&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;[Definition: Comments may appear anywhere in a document outside other markup; in addition, they may appear within the document type declaration at places allowed by the grammar. They are not part of the document's character data; an XML processor MAY, but need not, make it possible for an application to retrieve the text of comments. For compatibility, the string "--" (double-hyphen) MUST NOT occur within comments.] Parameter entity references MUST NOT be recognized within comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this together means that you can put comments &lt;strong&gt;anywhere that's not inside other markup&lt;/strong&gt;, except that you &lt;strong&gt;cannot have an XML declaration if you lead with a comment&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while in theory theory agrees with practice, in practice it doesn't, so I'd be curious to see how your experiment works out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I would do is go through &lt;a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/langref/migration.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Adobe's migration guide&lt;/a&gt; (which is basically just an itemized list of what has changed) item by item and try to figure out if each item can be changed via a simple search and replace operation (possibly using a regex) or whether it's easier to just manually edit the occurrences to correspond to AS3. Probably in a lot of cases (especially if, as you said, the amount of code to be migrated is quite high) you'll be best off scripting the changes (i.e. using regex search &amp;amp; replace) and manually fixing any border cases where the automated changes have failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be prepared to set some time aside for a bit of debugging and running through some test cases as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, as others have already mentioned, trying to combine AS2 SWFs with AS3 SWFs is not a good idea and doesn't really even work, so you'll definitely have to migrate all of the code in one project at once.&lt;/p&gt;

Because this code is compiled already (right?) you can't depend on &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt; to redirect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you can implement these in the obvious way and log that they came from a certain module by linking those routines to those modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fastest way involves &lt;em&gt;no logging at all.&lt;/em&gt;  If the amount of memory they use is bounded, why not pre-allocate all the "heap" they'll ever need and write an allocator out of that?  Then when it's done, free the entire "heap" and you're done!  You could extend this idea to multiple heaps if it's more complex that that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you really do need to "log" and not make your own allocator, here's some ideas. One, use a hash table with pointers and internal chaining.  Another would be to allocate extra space in front of every block and put your own structure there containing, say, an index into your "log table," then keep a free-list of log table entries (as a stack so getting a free one or putting a free one back is O(1)).  This takes more memory but should be fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it practical?  I think it is, so long as the speed-hit is acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many advantages to interfaces relative to abstract classes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can switch implementations w/o re-building code that depends on the interface.  This is useful for: proxy classes, dependency injection, AOP, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can separate the API from the implementation in your code.  This can be nice because it makes it obvious when you're changing code that will affect other modules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It allows developers writing code that is dependent on your code to easily mock your API for testing purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You gain the most advantage from interfaces when dealing with modules of code.  However, there is no easy rule to determine where module boundaries should be.  So this best practice is easy to over-use, especially when first designing some software.&lt;/p&gt;

There is a __malloc_hook manpage showing the prototypes. You can add track allocations in these hooks, then return to let glibc handle the memory allocation/deallocation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds like you want to free any live allocations when the third-party function returns. There are ways to have gcc automatically insert calls at every function entrance and exit using -finstrument-functions, but I think that would be inelegant for what you are trying to do. Can you have your own code call a function in your memory-tracking library after calling one of these third-party functions? You could then check if there are any allocations which the third-party function did not already free.&lt;/p&gt;

the server and C#/WPF/.Net stack to develop the  client. C# because
bezier curves in WPF is a snap and I have a particular type of  GUI in
mind for the client component.  This is my own idea/project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

is. My past work experience did not involve programming, or IT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because that's what all the books say. Like the GoF patterns, many people see it as universally good and don't ever think about whether or not it is really the right design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you know all the relationships between objects that will occur within that interface?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't, and that's a problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If
you already know those relationships,
then why not just extend an abstract
class?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reasons to not extend an abstract class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have radically different implementations and making a decent base class is too hard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to burn your one and only base class for something else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If neither apply, go ahead and use an abstract class. It will save you a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions you didn't ask:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the down-sides of using an interface?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cannot change them. Unlike an abstract class, an interface is set in stone. Once you have one in use, extending it will break code, period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I really need either?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, no. Think really hard before you build any object hierarchy. A big problem in languages like Java is that it makes it way too easy to create massive, complicated object hierarchies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the classic example LameDuck inherits from Duck. Sounds easy, doesn't it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that is until you need to indicate that the duck has been injured and is now lame. Or indicate that the lame duck has been healed and can walk again. Java does not allow you to change an objects type, so using sub-types to indicate lameness doesn't actually work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Your addition operation causes the int to be converted to an unsigned int.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assuming two's complement representation and equally sized types, the bit pattern does not change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conversion from unsigned int to signed int is implementation dependent. (But it probably works the way you expect on most platforms these days.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rules are a little more complicated in the case of combining signed and unsigned of differing sizes.&lt;/li&gt;

Look at streaming services that cater to the customer you want, and have significant volume (maybe youtube) and see what they're pushing.  You'll find there'a pretty direct correlation between alexa rating (popularity) and quality(minimum bitrate required).  Vimeo will always have fewer users than Youtube because the user experience is poor for low bitrate users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many other factors, and this should only form one small facet of your bandwidth decision, but it's a useful comparison to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, however, that you want to degrade gracefully.  As more and more sites come online you'll start bumping into ISPs that limit total transfer, and being able to tell your customers how much of their bandwidth your site is consuming is useful, as well as proclaiming that you are a low bandwidth site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, more and more users are using portable cellular connections (iPhone) where limited bandwidth is a big deal.  AT&amp;amp;T has oversold many markets so being able to get useful video through a tiny link will enable you to capture market that vimeo and Hulu cannot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite frankly, though, the best thing to do is degrade on the fly gracefully.  Measure the bandwidth of the connection continuously and adjust bandwidth as needed for a smooth playback experience with good audio.  Then you can take all users across the gamut...&lt;/p&gt;

the VC6 and recent VS(2003+) compiler ouptut window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, this exploits the fact that items output in the compiler output
are essentially being parsed for "PATH(LINENUM): message".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presumes on the Microsoft compiler's treatment of "pragma remind".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn't quite exactly what you asked... but it might be generally helpful
in arriving at something you can get the compiler to emit that some editors might honor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    // The following definitions will allow you to insert
    // clickable items in the output stream of the Microsoft compiler.
    // The error and warning variants will be reported by the
    // IDE as actual warnings and errors... which means you can make
    // them occur in the task list.

    // In theory, the coding standards could be checked to some extent
    // in this way and reminders that show up as warnings or even
    // errors inserted...


    #define strify0(X) #X
    #define strify(X) strify0(X)
    #define remind(S) message(__FILE__ "(" strify( __LINE__ ) ") : " S)

    // example usage
    #pragma remind("warning:  fake warning")
    #pragma remind("error:  fake error")

&lt;p&gt;Correct me if I'm wrong. Your basic solution now is kind of an Observer pattern, where the data object (Account, etc) notifies about changes in their states. You think that the problem is that the subscribing plugin has to register in every object to be able to handle notifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's not a problem per se, you can put the event control in the &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/domainModel.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Domain Model&lt;/a&gt;, but I suggest you create a &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/serviceLayer.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Service Layer&lt;/a&gt; and do this event notifications in this layer. That way just one object would be responsible for publishing notifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, OpenID is not bad.  It consolidates login credentials.  It does solve a real problem, while it may not be the optimal solution  The only two problems I can see are that you must trust the identity provider not to allow someone else to claim to be you, and that relying parties (web sites you log in to) can collude to link your identity on multiple sites together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also can't remember for the life of my why you should never return an Array of generics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public T[] getAll&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;() { ... }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never liked templates in C++, but that was mostly because none of the compilers could ever spit out a remotely meaningful error message for them.  One time I actually did a &lt;code&gt;make realclean &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make&lt;/code&gt; 17 times to get something to compile; I never did figure out why the 17th time was the charm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, who actually &lt;em&gt;likes&lt;/em&gt; using generics in their pet language?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think people could benefit from reading "Showstopper"; the book about the development of Windows NT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole reason the services run as DLL's in one process on Windows NT was that they were too slow as separate processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you got down and dirty you'd find that the library loading strategy is the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Unices ( in general) the Shared libraries (DLL's) code segments are actually shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows NT loads a copy of the DLL per process, becauase it manipulates the library code segment (and executable code segment) after loading. (Tells it where is your data ?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This results in code segments in libraries that are not reusable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the NT process create is actually pretty expensive. And on the down side, it makes DLL's no appreciable saving in memory, but a chance for inter-app dependency problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it pays in engineering to step back and say, "now, if we were going to design this to really suck, what would it look like?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked with an embedded system that was quite temperamental once upon a time, and one day looked at it and realized it was a cavity magnetron, with the electronics in the microwave cavity. We made it much more stable (and less like a microwave) after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mechanics of OpenID credentials, providers and suppliers shouldn't need to be exposed to the user. People talk about educating the masses of internet users, but that's never going to happen - the masses never stop being stupid. If you want to appeal to the masses, you need to bring the technology down to meet their level instead. When a Google-affiliated site picks up that you're logged into Google and silently uses that account, it works without you ever having to tell it who you are. The fact that OpenID is so clumsy in comparison is why the big providers like Google are still avoiding it, and why the general public won't adopt it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the developers of OpenID messed up when they used a URL rather than an email address for the IDs. People know what email addresses are, they already have one that's associated with them (or can get one easily), and email providers like Google and Microsoft are happy to adopt a role as portals. In fact, an automatic translation from email address to URL is all it would take:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to experiment with XML Literals to generate some XML code for me, instead of using XMLDocument&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have 2 questions, the second regarding a workaround due to my inability to figure out the first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1: Ideal solution&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a Dictionary of ElementName, ElementValue whose KeyValue pairs I was looping over in the hope of generating the values dynamically, but the following syntax dies a horrible death&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Dim xConnections As XElement        
For Each connection As Connection In connections.AsList
    For Each kvp As KeyValuePair(Of String, String) In connection.DecompiledElements
        xConnections = &amp;lt;Connections&amp;gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;%= kvp.Key %&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;%= kvp.Value %&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\&amp;lt;%=kvp.Key %&amp;gt;&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/Connections&amp;gt;
    Next
Next
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have vague memories of the T4 syntax (the &amp;lt;%=%&gt; syntax) being able to handle more complex operations (rather than direct assignment to the &amp;lt;%= ) and a 'Response.Write' like object to write output to, but I can't remember the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2: Cludgy workaround&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead I thought of building a StringBuilder object and assigning its .ToString to the XElement, but that also failed with a conversion error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would prefer to continue using my key value pair concept in example one above, as I feel cludging together a string as in example 2 above is rather nasty, and I really should go back to using XMLDocument if instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts or assistance greatly appreciated&lt;/p&gt;

The reason why &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Foo&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is different than &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;? extends Foo&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is that when &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt; is a subtype of &lt;code&gt;Bar&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Foo&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is not a subtype of &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Bar&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. If you could treat a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Foo&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; object as a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Bar&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, then you could add &lt;code&gt;Bar&lt;/code&gt; objects to it, which could break things. Any reasonable type system will require this. Java lets you get away with treating &lt;code&gt;Foo[]&lt;/code&gt; as a subtype of &lt;code&gt;Bar[]&lt;/code&gt;, but this forces runtime checks, reducing performance. When you return such an array, this makes it difficult for the compiler to know whether to do a runtime check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never needed to use the lower bounds (&lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;? super Foo&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;), but I would imagine they might be useful for returning generic values. See &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)" rel="nofollow"&gt;covariance and contravariance&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the whole though, I definitely agree with the complaints about overly verbose syntax and confusing error messages. Languages with type inference like OCaml and Haskell will probably make this easier on you, although their error messages can be confusing as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy to use&lt;/strong&gt;:  I have experience developing on Eclipse and I have to say it's not easy to understand its development model. Sure for basic stuff it has some wizards that make easier, but for something a little more complex it's just difficult. I don't know about Netbeans, but I heard its easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistent API&lt;/strong&gt;: I think Eclipse wins in this aspect. It runs over OSGI (brings some complexity though) and has plugins extensions for pretty much everything. It seems to be the platform of choice for plugin development, so I can assume it's reliable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documentation&lt;/strong&gt;: Eclipse wins by far. The help from eclipse site is excelent and the mailing list has plenny of users questions.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to track down what is going on would be to look at a dump of the hung process. If you are on Vista, just right-click on the process and choose to create a memory dump. If you are on Windows XP, and don't have the &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/DevTools/Debugging/default.mspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;Debugging Tools for Windows&lt;/a&gt; installed, you can get a memory dump using ntsd.exe. You'll need the process ID, which you can get from Task Manager by adding the PID column to the Processes tab display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have that, run the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ntsd -p &amp;lt;PID&amp;gt;
.dump C:\mydump.dmp
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can then either inspect that dump using &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/johan/archive/2007/11/13/getting-started-with-windbg-part-i.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;WinDBG and SOS&lt;/a&gt; or if you can post the dump somewhere I'd be happy to take a look at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, you'll want to likely take two dumps about a minute apart. That way if you do things like !runaway you can see which threads are working which will help you track down why it is hanging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other question - are you on VS2008 SP1?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assume I need to &lt;em&gt;store&lt;/em&gt; credit card numbers for customers, so that the obvious solution of relying on the credit card processor to do the heavy lifting is not available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aladdin.com/etoken/"&gt;PCI Data Security&lt;/a&gt;, which is apparently the standard for storing credit card info, has a bunch of general requirements, but &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_DSS"&gt;how does one implement them&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what about the vendors, like &lt;a href="http://usa.visa.com/merchants/risk_management/cisp_payment_applications.html"&gt;Visa&lt;/a&gt;, who have their own best practices?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I need to have keyfob access to the machine? What about physically protecting it from hackers in the building?  Or even what if someone got their hands on the backup files with the sql server data files on it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about backups? Are there other physical copies of that data around?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tip: &lt;a href="http://transfs.com/blog/"&gt;If you get a merchant account, you should negotiate that they charge you "interchange-plus" instead of tiered pricing.&lt;/a&gt;  With tiered pricing, they will charge you different rates based on what type of Visa/MC is used -- ie. they charge you more for cards with big rewards attached to them.  Interchange plus billing means you only pay the processor what Visa/MC charges them, plus a flat fee.  (Amex and Discover charge their own rates directly to merchants, so this doesn't apply to those cards.  You'll find Amex rates to be in the 3% range and Discover could be as low as 1%.  Visa/MC is in the 2% range).  &lt;a href="http://transfs.com/"&gt;This service is supposed to do the negotiation for you&lt;/a&gt; (I haven't used it, this is not an ad, and I'm not affiliated with the website, but this service is greatly needed.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog post gives a &lt;a href="http://blog.boxedice.com/2009/05/20/taking-payments-online-merchant-account-payment-processor-fees/"&gt;complete rundown of handling credit cards&lt;/a&gt; (specifically for the UK).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I phrased the question wrong, but I'm looking for tips like these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href="http://www.rsa.com/node.aspx?id=1156"&gt;SecurID&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.aladdin.com/etoken/"&gt;eToken&lt;/a&gt; to add an additional password layer to the physical box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure the box is in a room with a physical lock or keycode combination.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could create a session type object. Each plugin listens for events on the session object. The data object no longer raises the event - it calls the session object to raise the event (one of the parameters would have to be the data object raising the event).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means that your plugins only have to subscribe to one event, but they get the event from all data objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is frustrating and entirely avoidable. Short of grabbing an expert with the code that can choose the "most likely" object that was null ... this is a real practical pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One expression per line also helps out quite a bit while stepping through code. I practice this with the assumption that most modern compilers can optimize away all the superfluous temp objects I've just created ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to be neat - but cluttering my code with explicit objects sure feels laborious at times. It does not generally make the code easier to browse - but it really has come in handy when tracing things down in production or stepping through my or someone else's code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What style do &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; advocate and can you rationalize it in a practical sense?&lt;/p&gt;

In my experience, there's a close correlation between the ability to see a personal project through to completion, and the ability to get work done independently on a large project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to answer your question, for resume purposes I'd advise the pattern recognition project only if you're confident that the result will be something solid that you can show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, you should work on the project that's most interesting to you, no question. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because there was no such thing as internet/intranet/LANs/WANs in the old days, all balancing is done at "end-of-day". Transactions done in one branch with a certain bank account are oblivious of the transactions done in another; all of the balance resolution will occur during end of day. When mainframes came in the same rule applied: resolutions are done by computer by a long-running-process usually run between 9PM and 12 midnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the reason behind terms such as "current balance" and "available balance", e.g., available balance is what has been determined by the end-of-day process as an account's balance for the previous day; current balance is what it's supposed to be, but you can't touch it yet since the bank is not sure if you've made some transaction somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the advent of ATMs, the internet, and other interconnectivity technologies, "real time" balance resolution is now possible: a withdrawal, an online transaction, a purchase debit, etc will immediately be reflected in the customers' bank accounts without the need to wait for end-of-day processing.&lt;/p&gt;

TTF_IDISHWND | TTF_SUBCLASS. (c++, win32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a manifest file such that my program uses the new WindowsXP themes
(comctrl32 version 6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I hover over a registered tool, the tip appears.&lt;br /&gt;
Good.&lt;br /&gt;
When I click the mouse, the tip disappears.&lt;br /&gt;
Ok.&lt;br /&gt;
However, moving away from the tool and back
again does not make the tip re-appear. I need to hover over a different tool
and then come back to my tool to get the tip to come back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I remove my manifest file (to use the older non-XP comctrl32), the
problem goes away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After doing some experimentation, I discovered the following differences
between ToolTips in Comctl32 version 5 (old) and Comctl32 version 6 (new):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;New TTF_TRANSPARENT ToolTips (when used In-Place) actually return
HTCLIENT from WM_NCITTEST if a mouse button is down, thus getting
WM_LBUTTONDOWN and stealing focus for a moment before vanishing. This causes
the application's border to flash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old TTF_TRANSPARENT ToolTips always return HTTRANSPARENT from WM_NCHITTEST,
and thus never get WM_LBUTTONDOWN themselves and never steal focus. (This seems to be just aesthetic, but may impact the next point...)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;New ToolTips seem not to get WM_TIMER events after a mouse-click, and
only resume getting (a bunch of) timer events after being de-activated and
re-activated. Thus, they do not re-display their tip window after a mouse
click and release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old ToolTips get a WM_TIMER message as soon as the mouse is moved again
after click/release, so they are ready to re-display their tip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, as a comctl32 workaround, I had to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;subclass the TOOLTIPS_CLASS window and always return HTTRANSPARENT from
WM_NCHITTEST if the tool asked for transparency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;avoid using TTF_SUBCLASS and rather process the mouse messages myself so
I could de-activate/re-activate upon receiving WM_xBUTTONUP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assume that the change in internal behavior was to accommodate the new "clickable" features in ToolTips like hyperlinks, but the hover behavior appears to be thus broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know of a better solution than my subclass workaround? Am I missing some other point?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In JavaScript, strings are immutable objects, which means that the
  characters within them may not be changed and that any operations on
  strings actually create new strings. Strings are assigned by
  reference, not by value. In general, when an object is assigned by
  reference, a change made to the object through one reference will be
  visible through all other references to the object. Because strings
  cannot be changed, however, you can have multiple references to a
  string object and not worry that the string value will change without
  your knowing it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider just returning an IQueryable&amp;lt;Customer&amp;gt; instead of an IList&amp;lt;Customer&amp;gt; from your data-access method. Since IQueryable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; inherits from IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; the rest of your app should be able to deal with it quite well. You can also convert it to a List when you really need to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantage of this is that you can dynamically modify your query quite easily and minimze the amount of data returned from SQL Server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g. if your method signature is
IQueryable&amp;lt;Customer&amp;gt; GetCustomers() you could get a single customer by calling GetCustomers().Where(c =&gt; c.CustomerID == 101).Single();&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example only one record would be returned from the database whereas I imagine currently your code would return either all customers or you'd be required to write separate methods (and thus very repetitive code) to cater for all the different things you may want to filter by.&lt;/p&gt;

A tuple is a good way to pack multiple values into that cookie without having to define a separate class to contain them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to be judicious about this particular use, though.  If the cookies are used liberally throughout the code, it's better to create a class because it helps document their use. If they are only used in one place (e.g. one pair of methods) then I might use a tuple. In any case, because it's Python you can start with a tuple and then change it to an instance of a custom class without having to change any code in the caller.&lt;/p&gt;

Anyway ....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The First Approach aka Inheritance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows polymorphic behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is &lt;em&gt;initially&lt;/em&gt; simple and convenient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;May&lt;/em&gt; become complex or clumsy over time &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; more behavior and relations are added.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Second Approach aka Composition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maps well to non-oop scenarios like relational tables, structured programing, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is straightforward (if not necessarily convenient) to &lt;em&gt;incrementally&lt;/em&gt; extend relations and behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No polymorphism therefore it's less convenient to use related information and behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a somewhat tricky problem, because there are some class of URLs which are just plain BAD: the /azenv.php bot attacks, the people typing /bar/foo/baz into the URL, etc... we don't want that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there's subtle routing problems, where we do want to be notified:  /artists/ for example, or ///.  In these situations, we may want an error being thrown, or not... or we get Google sending us URLs which used to be valid but are no longer because people deleted them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In each of these situations, I want a way to contain, analyze and filter the path that we get back, or at least some Railsy way to manage routing past the normal 'fallback catchall' url.  Does this exist?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the code here is: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# File vendor/rails/actionpack/lib/action_controller/rescue.rb, line 141

def rescue_action_without_handler(exception)
 log_error(exception) if logger
 erase_results if performed?

 # Let the exception alter the response if it wants.
 # For example, MethodNotAllowed sets the Allow header.
 if exception.respond_to?(:handle_response!)
   exception.handle_response!(response)
 end

 if consider_all_requests_local || local_request?
   rescue_action_locally(exception)
 else
  rescue_action_in_public(exception)
 end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So our best option is to override log_error(exception) so that we can filter down the exceptions according to the exception.  So in ApplicationController&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def log_error(exception)
    message = '...'
    if should_log_exception_as_debug?(exception)
      logger.debug(message)
    else
      logger.error(message)
    end
end

def should_log_exception_as_debug?(exception)
   return (ActionController::RoutingError === exception)
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salt for additional logic where we want different controller logic, routes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      sys.stdout.write("%2d%%" % percent)
      sys.stdout.write("\b\b\b")

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Output: MyFileName... 9%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any other ideas or recommendations to do this? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that's somewhat annoying is the blinking cursor in the terminal on the first digit of the percentage. Is there a way to prevent this? Is there a way to hide the cursor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here a better alternative using a global variable for the filename in dlProgress and the '\r' code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    global rem_file # global variable to be used in dlProgress

    urllib.urlretrieve(rem_file, loc_file, reporthook=dlProgress)

    def dlProgress(count, blockSize, totalSize):
      percent = int(count*blockSize*100/totalSize)
      sys.stdout.write("\r" + rem_file + "...%d%%" % percent)
      sys.stdout.flush()
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Output: MyFileName...9% &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the cursor shows up at the END of the line. Much better.&lt;/p&gt;

A dialog will appear asking for a URL, you can just paste it in: "http://www.webservice.com/webservice.asmx". VS will autogenerate all the helpers you need. Then you can just call:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.webservice.www.WebService ws = new com.webservice.www.WebService();
// this assumes your web method takes in the fXML as an integer attribute
return ws.SomeWebMethod(1);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The ProgressBar class manages the progress, and the format of the line is given by a number of widgets. A widget is an object that may display diferently depending on the state of the progress. There are three types of widget: - a string, which always shows itself; - a ProgressBarWidget, which may return a diferent value every time it's update method is called; and - a ProgressBarWidgetHFill, which is like ProgressBarWidget, except it expands to fill the remaining width of the line.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The progressbar module is very easy to use, yet very powerful. And automatically supports features like auto-resizing when available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend creating accounts specifically for svn access with no other access to that server. My guess is that you would use a daily build or automated script to update your stored procs in the db. Daily builds can have their own special accounts and their own ssh keys. I don't like for my automated tools to run with the same login as a human user (so I know which tool is broken).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't understand all of the security tricks, searching google can get you some help. If you have trouble, set one up without the security tricks first. That makes it a bit simpler to troubleshoot. &lt;/p&gt;

  <row Id="51258" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="51217" CreationDate="2008-09-09T05:35:14.253" Score="19" Body="&lt;p&gt;Setting up SVN repositories can be tricky only in the sense of how you organize them.  Before we setup SVN, I actually RTFM'd the online &lt;a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Subversion manual&lt;/a&gt; which discusses organizational techniques for repositories and some of the gotchas you should think about in advance, namely what you cannot do after you have created your repositories if you decide to change your mind.  I suggest a pass through this manual before setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us, as consultants, we do custom and in-house software development as well as some document management through SVN.  It was in our interest to create one repository for each client and one for ourselves.  Within each repository, we created folders for each project (software or otherwise).  This allowed us to segment security access by repository and by client and even by project within a repository.  Going deeper, for each software project we created 'working', 'tags' and 'branches' folders.  We generally put releases in 'tags' using 'release_w.x.y.z' as the tag for a standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your case, to keep sprocs, scripts, and other related documents in synch, you can create a project folder, then under that a 'working' folder, then under that 'code' and next to it 'scripts', etc.  Then when you tag the working version for release, you end up tagging it all together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;\Repository
   \ProjectX
      \Working
         \Code       
         \Scripts
         \Notes       
      \Tags
      \Branches
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for non-code, I would suggest a straight folder layout by project or document type (manuals, policies, etc.).  Generally with documents and depending on how your company operates, just having the version history/logs is enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We run SVN on Windows along with &lt;a href="http://websvn.tigris.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;WebSVN&lt;/a&gt; which is a great open source repository viewer.  We use it to give clients web access to their code and it's all driven by the underlying Subversion security.  Internally, we use &lt;a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;TortoiseSVN&lt;/a&gt; to manage the repositories, commit, update, import, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing is that training should be considered an integral part of your deployment.  Users new to version control may have a hard time understanding what is going on.  We found that giving them functional instructions (do this when creating a project, do this when updating, etc.) was very helpful while they learned the concepts.  We created a 'sandbox' repository where users can play all they want with documents and folders to practice, you may find this useful as well to experiment on what policies to establish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@JasonS is right, to upload file you need to transfer it as a byte stream. You need to use &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms733742.aspx"&gt;WCF streaming&lt;/a&gt;. For example on how to upload file via WCF see &lt;a href="http://kjellsj.blogspot.com/2007/02/wcf-streaming-upload-files-over-http.html"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://kjellsj.blogspot.com"&gt;http://kjellsj.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
