The Java aspects of the code run the web UI and establish state on the devices that we're talking to, and the C++ code does the real-time crunching of data coming back from the devices. Shared memory is used to pass device state and context information from the Java code through to the C++ code. The Java code uses a PostgreSQL database to persist its state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're running into some pretty severe performance bottlenecks, and right now the only way we can scale is to increase memory and CPU counts. We're stuck on the one physical box due to the shared memory design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know we need to move away from this to be able to scale out by adding more machines to the cluster, and I'm in the early stages of working out exactly how we'll do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I'm looking at Terracotta as a way of scaling out the Java code, but I haven't got as far as working out how to scale out the C++ to match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as scaling for performance we need to consider high availability as well. The application needs to be available pretty much the whole time -- not absolutely 100%, which isn't cost effective, but we need to do a reasonable job of surviving a machine outage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you had to undertake the task I've been given, what would you do?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What isnt generally realised is that
  you can change attribute &lt;strong&gt;instance&lt;/strong&gt; values fairly
  easily at runtime. The reason is, of
  course, that the instances of the
  attribute classes that are created are
  perfectly normal objects and can be
  used without restriction. For example,
  we can get the object:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ASCII[] attrs1=(ASCII[])

  and show that its value is unchanged:&lt;/p&gt;

Might not be a single sign on solution, but have you try looking into something that is more targetted solution like MS Identity Lifecycle Manager?  It will simplify identity synchronization between applications and it's pluggable as well, meaning you can hook up your own code to do the synchronization between different system.  So if you change the identity info (i.e. login info) in ILM portal, you can propagate those to the different systems.  Same thing for provisioning and deprovisioning identity.  Single point of entry.&lt;br /&gt;
I supposed you can use biztalk also for similar thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for truly single sign on solution where you just logged in once and you don't have to login again to different applications.  I've yet to find one.&lt;/p&gt;

Silverlight got great support for passing types between JavaScript and Managed Code, but now I've bumped against a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft ASP.NET AJAX Client Libraries includes a "type system", and one of the things the framework does is validating that the parameters is of correct type. The specific function I'm calling is the Sys.Application.addHistoryPoint, and the validation code looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var e = Function.validateParams(arguments, [
    {name: "state", type: Object},
    {name: "title", type: String, mayBeNull: true, optional: true}
]);

&lt;p&gt;My only evidence is anecdotal and on a different platform: after porting a bunch of CPU-hungry apps to C# (.NET 2.0), I did not notice substantial loss in performance (I do not consider 10% substantial). Well written code seems to perform well on a variety of architectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;xsl:param&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; does nothing - as the variable it creates is never used. To use a parameter passed to an XSLT stylesheet you refer to it as a variable $message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;xsl:value-of select="//message"/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; searches for all elements called 'message' and then returns the textual value of this. The textual value of a number of elements is basically the concatenation of their text contents, which in this example is &lt;code&gt;hello world!&lt;/code&gt;, so what you say it is returning isn't correct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;xsl:template match="/"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the most complicated to explain easily, but basically it matches the root element of your input XML and processes its contents.&lt;/li&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;TextField&lt;/code&gt; documentation states that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; tag lets you embed external image files (JPEG, GIF, PNG), SWF files, and movie clips inside text fields. Text automatically flows around images you embed in text fields. To use this tag, you must set the text field to be multiline and to wrap text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which means that you can display an image in a &lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt; component in Flex by setting its &lt;code&gt;htmlText&lt;/code&gt; property to some HTML which contains an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. You can't use &lt;code&gt;Label&lt;/code&gt;, because it is not multiline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've noticed that text fields have trouble with properly measuring their heights if the images displayed in them are left or right aligned with text flowing around them (e.g. &lt;code&gt;align="left"&lt;/code&gt;). You may have to add some extra spacing below to counter that if you plan to use aligned images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest points I learned from his book is a good understanding of the inherent declarative, template-based approach of XSLT.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding this allows you to write much more clear and maintainable XSLT, when compared to a more procedural (ie conditionals, loops etc) approach often used by newcomers to the topic.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conditional constructs have their place in XSLT, however knowing when to use them versus a more template oriented approach is the tricky part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 9 "Stylesheet Design Patterns" describes this very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this other program's installer adds its own directory to the PATH environment variable, then you could rely on that.

My customers buy the software as a service and I host everything. However, there is some demand for on-site deployment inside the clients' own networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, because I host the system, there is no built-in license management in the app. I bill based on user accounts and data capacity (it's a processing and analysis app for metering data) and I just set up whatever the client pays for and the client can't setup those things himself. Even without on-site installation, that should be changed for better scalability anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"safe enough" rather than "military grade"&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;make the number of user accounts and the data capacity both reasonably tamper-proof and easy to up- / downgrade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work without an Internet connection (having a completely self-contained system would be the main point of opting for the on-site solution), though it might be acceptable if there has to be a temporary connection during installation&lt;/li&gt;

On another part of this page there are a set of links which, when clicked, the entire page reloads and looks exactly the same as before except for the chart in the middle of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I want to do is when a link is clicked on a page just the chart on the page is changed.  This will speed things up tremendously as the page is roughly 100kb large, and don't really want to reload the entire page just to display this.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been doing this via JavaScript, which works so far, using the following code&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;document.getElementById('chart').src = '/charts/10.png';
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that when the user clicks on the link, it may take a couple of seconds before the chart changes.  This makes the user think that their click hasn't done anything, or that the system is slow to respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I want to happen is display a spinner / throbber / status indicator, in place of where the image is while it is loading, so when the user clicks the link they know at least the system has taken their input and is doing something about it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've tried a few suggestions, even using a psudo time out to show a spinner, and then flick back to the image.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good suggestion I've had is to use the following&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img src="/charts/10.png" lowsrc="/spinner.gif"/&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which would be ideal, except the spinner is significantly smaller than the chart which is being displayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any other ideas?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technical Knowledge: "How to guide" with screenshots and a short demo - similar to the way you will see new features at a conference.  The added benefit of this is what you have got is documented for when you leave the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem solving: informal discussions, short internal projects, lessons learned and an internal FAQ system which EVERYONE is responsible for updating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soft Skills (people skills): social meetings/outings/informal events etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measuring that is going to be difficult though, as no matter how you transfer your knowledge there will always be varying degrees of uptake, after all, just because I do something one way doesnt mean its correct.

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few tips I enjoy using to slice and dice code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Variable names&lt;/strong&gt;: how would you describe this variable to someone else on your team?  You would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; say "the numberOfLinesSoFar integer".  You would say "numLines" or something similar - comprehensible and short.  Don't pretend like the maintainer doesn't know the code at all, but make sure you yourself could figure out what the variable is, even if you forgot your own act of writing it.  Yes, this is kind of obvious, but it's worth more effort than I see many coders put into it, so I list it first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control flow&lt;/strong&gt;: Avoid lots of closing clauses at once (a series of }'s in C++).  Usually when you see this, there's a way to avoid it.  A common case is something like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (things_are_ok) {
  // Do a lot of stuff.
  return true;
} else {
  ExpressDismay(error_str);
  return false;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;can be replaced by&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (!things_are_ok) return ExpressDismay(error_str);
// Do a lot of stuff.
return true;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if we can get ExpressDismay (or a wrapper thereof) to return false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another case is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loop iterations&lt;/strong&gt;: the more standard, the better.  For shorter loops, it's good to use one-character iterators when the variable is never used except as an index into a single object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The particular case I would argue here is against the "right" way to use an STL container:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (vector&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;::iterator a_str = my_vec.begin(); a_str != my_vec.end(); ++a_str)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is a lot wordier, and requires overloaded pointer operators *a_str or a_str-&gt;size() in the loop.  For containers that have fast random access, the following is a lot easier to read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; my_vec.size(); ++i)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;with references to my_vec[i] in the loop body, which won't confuse anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I often see coders take pride in their line number counts.  But it's not the line numbers that count!  I'm not sure of the best way to implement this, but if you have any influence over your coding culture, I'd try to shift the reward toward those with compact classes :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd posted a list of software quality metrics that I could think of off the top of my head that included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;McCabe Cyclometric Complexity - basically a measure of the number of linear paths through code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Levels of indentation - a measure of complexity when looking at nested decision statements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distance from declaration to first use - how many statements exist between where a variable is declared and where it is first used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comment percentage - how many lines of code are comments compared to source code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Percent test coverage - as a percentage of lines of code, how many are exercised by your suite of tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Path test coverage - how many paths of execution are exercised by your tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unit coverage - how many individual units, classes, packages, etc., are exercised by your unit tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kris's comment was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Only the test-coverage metrics listed here could be considered a measure of "quality." The others are measurements of complexity and readability, which really has nothing to do with quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the fact that I don't agree with this statement at all, it got me thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I have to review code that has hardly any associated tests, whether unit, system or integration, I tend to approach the code much, much more warily than if I see a good suite of tests that have been successfully passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same thing when performing security audits on code. If I see unused variables, huge functions, bizarre mixtures of configs, per server, per dir, etc. being used in Apache modules it also predisposes me to approach the code very warily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone else use this initial "gut feeling" approach and does it affect the outcome?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW I don't agree with Kris's comment because all the other metrics are definitely valid measures that will help highlight badly designed, poorly executed code. As Damian Conway says:&lt;/p&gt;

I come from a background of a strong love for C-based coding, where everything is perhaps more complicated than it should be (but puts hair on your chest, at least). So switching from C to Python for more complex things that don't require tons of speed has been more of a boon than a bane in writing projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, coming from this land of brackets and parentheses and structs as far as the naked eye can see, I come across a small problem: I find Python difficult to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the following block of text is hard for me to decipher unless I stare at it (which I dislike doing):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if foo:
   bar = baz
   while bar not biz:
      bar = i_am_going_to_find_you_biz_i_swear_on_my_life()

did_i_not_warn_you_biz()
my_father_is_avenged()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem occurs at the end of that if block: all the tabbing and then suddenly returning to a jarring block feels almost disturbing. As a solution, I've started coding my Python like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if foo:
   bar = baz
   while bar not biz:
      bar = i_am_going_to_find_you_biz_i_swear_on_my_life()
   #-- while --
#-- if --

did_i_not_warn_you_biz()
my_father_is_avenged()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this, for some odd reason, makes me more able to read my own code. But I'm curious: has anyone else with my strange problem found easier ways to make their tabbed-out code more readable? I'd love to find out if there's a better way to do this before this becomes a huge habit for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could argue that quality is just down to whether the proof is &lt;strong&gt;correct&lt;/strong&gt;, that is it correctly goes from assumptions to result. However, most mathematicians would agree that some proofs are better than others because they are shorter, or more cleverly done, or easier to understand, and these are measures of quality. Only the first definition is formally definable, but most Mathematicians I think would mean the second if they said "a better proof". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Performance and Scalability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choice of session store has an effect on performance and scalability. This should only be a big problem if you have a very popular application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both database and filesystem session stores are (usually) backed by disks so you can have a lot of sessions cheaply (because disks are cheap), but requests will often have to wait for the data to be read (because disks are slow). Memcached sessions use RAM, so will cost more to support the same number of concurrent sessions (because RAM is expensive), but may be faster (because RAM is fast).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Filesystem sessions are tied to the box where your application is running, so you can't load balance between multiple application servers if your site gets huge. Database and memcached sessions let you have multiple application servers talking to a shared session store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Simplicity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choice of session store will also impact how easy it is to deploy your site. Changing away from the default will cost some complexity. Memcached and RDBMSs both have their own complexities, but your application is probably going to be using an RDBMS anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you have a very popular application, simplicity should be the larger concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bonus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know if this is supported by Django, but another approach is to store session data in cookies (all of it, not just an ID). This has the advantage that the session store automatically scales with the number of users, but it has disadvantages too. You (or your framework) need to be careful to stop users forging session data. You also need to keep each session small because the whole thing will be sent with every request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I find iterators in Python more concise. You can use &lt;em&gt;for i in something&lt;/em&gt;, and it works with pretty much everything. Yeah, Java has gotten better since 1.5, but for example you can iterate through a string in python with this same construct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introspection: In python you can get at runtime information about an object or a module about its symbols, methods, or even its docstrings. You can also instantiate them dynamically. Java has some of this, but usually in Java it takes half a page of code to get an instance of a class, whereas in Python it is about 3 lines. And as far as I know the docstrings thing is not available in Java&lt;/li&gt;

So for example if your normal site tended to have a plain white background, you could have the beta site have a repeating beta text in a background image. You want to make it fairly faint so it is present  but doesn't detract from the overall experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another subtle but present option would just be to change the title bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you could do what google does, which is a large site with some of it in beta. Check out &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/experimental/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Google experimental search&lt;/a&gt;. Basically the site is no different, but it is hard to get to accidentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I have done this in the past I have usually put the legacy code in a dedicated "legacy" folder, as not to "disturb" the new and "well-structured" code tree. However, in the spirit of refactoring I feel this is somewhat wrong. In theory, the legacy code will be refactored over time and moved to its new location, but in practice this rarely happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you treat your legacy code? As much as I feel tempted to tuck away old sins in the "legacy" folder, never to look at it again, on some level I hope that by forcing it to live among the more "healthy" inhabitants in the repository, maybe the legacy code will have a better chance of getting well some day?&lt;/p&gt;

Subsequent uses of the feature will prominently deisplay that "thios part of the site is in beta and is used at your own peril."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this normal behaviour when using a SQL database?&lt;/p&gt;

\copy tuples from '350,000 responses.csv' delimiter as ','

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;java   1.5 threads ~ 7 ms    
java   1.5         ~ 10 ms    
python 2.5 numpy   ~ 18 ms  
python 2.5         ~ 370 ms

&lt;p&gt;Even sqlite3 is competitive with Postgres despite it assumping all columns are strings (for contrast: even using just switching to numeric columns instead of integers in Postgres results in 10x slowdown)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;increased the shared memory available to Postgres to 256MB    
increased the working memory to 2MB
disabled connection and statement logging
used a stored procedure via CREATE FUNCTION ... LANGUAGE SQL
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is, is my experience here normal, and this is what I can expect when using a SQL database?  I can understand that ACID must come with costs, but this is kind of crazy in my opinion.  I'm not asking for realtime game speed, but since Java can process millions of doubles in under 20 ms, I feel a bit jealous. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a better way to do simple OLAP on the cheap (both in terms of money and server complexity)?  I've looked into Mondrian and Pig + Hadoop but not super excited about maintaining yet another server application and not sure if they would even help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No the Python code and Java code do all the work in house so to speak.  I just generate 4 arrays with 350,000 random values each, then take the average.  I don't include the generation in the timings, only the averaging step.  The java threads timing uses 4 threads (one per array average), overkill but it's definitely the fastest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sqlite3 timing is driven by the Python program and is running from disk (not :memory:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize Postgres is doing much more behind the scenes, but most of that work doesn't matter to me since this is read only data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Postgres query doesn't change timing on subsequent runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've rerun the Python tests to include spooling it off the disk.  The timing slows down considerably to nearly 4 secs.  But I'm guessing that Python's file handling code is pretty much in C (though maybe not the csv lib?) so this indicates to me that Postgres isn't streaming from the disk either (or that you are correct and I should bow down before whoever wrote their storage layer!)&lt;/p&gt;

I've worked on a few performance critical real-time trading financial applications. I agree with Frank, nearly every time your problem is not the lack of being compiled, it is your algorithm or data structure. Modern hot-spot compilers are very good with the right code, for example the &lt;a href="http://acs.lbl.gov/~hoschek/colt/" rel="nofollow"&gt;CERN Colt library&lt;/a&gt; is within 90% of compiled, optimised Fortran for numerical work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are worried about speed I'd really recommend a good profiler and get evidence as to where your bottlenecks are - I use &lt;a href="http://www.yourkit.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;YourKit&lt;/a&gt; and have been very pleased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have only resorted to native compiled code for speed in one instance in the last few years, and that was so we could use &lt;a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home.html#" rel="nofollow"&gt;CUDA&lt;/a&gt; and get some serious GPU performance.&lt;/p&gt;

Originally named for a project to obtain MP3 ID3 data, the library does two hecks of a lot more than that and is quite convenient for all sorts of common or odd file meta data tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've used it to get the MIME types of files for online image and video tools. In all the testing I've done I've not seen getID3 get the MIME type wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've also used it to check if QuickTime videos have streaming hints. I mention  this as an example of versatility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second more time consuming option is to roll your own MIME type checker as already suggested. If you have a MIME magic file you can go a little further than a lookup on the file extension by comparing the first n bytes of file data against a first-n-bytes to MIME type lookup table derived from your MIME magic file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical MIME magic file will contain in excess of 500 sets of MIME types which might result in slow comparisons (lots of checks to make). Hard-coding the 10 most common MIME type checks in your home rolled solution will help there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working from 1st to last the cost/benefits are that the early options are much easier (quicker/cheaper) to set up put you pay quite high handling charges for each transaction. the later ones are much more costly to set up but you pay less in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;There are only few applications/users accessing the database, i.e. you will not result in 200 open (but probably idle) connections, because there are 200 different users shared on the same host.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;You have many, many webservers accessing one database server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using persistent connections is considerable faster, especially if you are accessing the database over a network. It doesn't make so much difference if the database is running on the same machine, but it is still a little bit faster. However - as the name says - the connection is persistent, i.e. it stays open, even if it is not used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with that is, that in "default configuration", MySQL only allows 1000 parallel "open channels". After that, new connections are refused (You can tweak this setting). So if you have - say - 20 Webservers with each 100 Clients on them, and every one of them has just one page access per hour, simple math will show you that you'll need 2000 parallel connections to the database. That won't work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ergo: Only use it for applications with lots of requests.&lt;/p&gt;

Now if you modify obItem, it doesn't affect the original.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;obItem.Name = "Gishu";  // MyList[1].Name still remains "peter"

&lt;p&gt;Now bear with me for 2 mins here (This takes a while to gulp down.. it did for me :)
If you really need structs to be stored in a collection and modified like you indicated in your question, you'll have to make your struct expose an interface (&lt;em&gt;However this will result in boxing&lt;/em&gt;). You can then modify the actual struct via an interface reference, which refers to the boxed object. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following code snippet illustrates what I just said above&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public interface IMyStructModifier
{      String Name { set;        }       }
public struct MyStruct : IMyStructModifier ...

List&amp;lt;Object&amp;gt; obList = new List&amp;lt;object&amp;gt;();
obList.Add(new MyStruct("ABC"));
obList.Add(new MyStruct("DEF"));

MyStruct temp = (MyStruct)obList[1];
temp.Name = "Gishu";
foreach (MyStruct s in obList) // =&amp;gt; "ABC", "DEF"
{      Console.WriteLine(s.Name);            }

 IMyStructModifier temp2 = obList[1] as IMyStructModifier;
 temp2.Name = "Now Gishu";
 foreach (MyStruct s in obList) // =&amp;gt; "ABC", "Now Gishu"
 {     Console.WriteLine(s.Name);       }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTH. Good Question.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; @&lt;a href="#51696"&gt;Hath &lt;/a&gt;- you had me running to check if I overlooked something that simple. (It would be inconsistent if setter properties dont and methods did - the .Net universe is still balanced :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Setter method doesn't work&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
obList2[1] returns a copy whose state would be modified. Original struct in list stays unmodified. So Set-via-Interface seems to be only way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;MyStruct&amp;gt; obList2 = new List&amp;lt;MyStruct&amp;gt;();
obList2.Add(new MyStruct("ABC"));
obList2.Add(new MyStruct("DEF"));
obList2[1].SetName("WTH");
foreach (MyStruct s in obList2) // =&amp;gt; "ABC", "DEF"
{
  Console.WriteLine(s.Name);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

If so, how can I access their common properties?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class MyObject&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;
{
   public T Value { get; set; }
   public string Name { get; set; }

   public MyObject(string name, T value)
   {
      Name = name;
      Value = value;
   }
}

var fst = new MyObject&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;("fst", 42);
var snd = new MyObject&amp;lt;bool&amp;gt;("snd", true);

List&amp;lt;MyObject&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;&amp;gt; list = new List&amp;lt;MyObject&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;&amp;gt;(){fst, snd};

foreach (MyObject&amp;lt;?&amp;gt; o in list)
   Console.WriteLine(o.Name);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this is pseudo code, this doesn't work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I don't need to access the .Value property (since that wouldn't be type-safe).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; Now that I've been thinking about this, It would be possible to use sub-classes for this. However, I think that would mean I'd have to write a new subclass for every new type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

Yes, that exactly answered my question. Of course, now I need to duplicate the entire shared interface, but that's not a big problem. I should have thought of that...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/51586/accessing-non-generic-members-of-a-generic-object#51611"&gt;aku&lt;/a&gt;
You are right about the duck typing. I wouldn't expect two completely random types of objects to be accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I thought generic objects would share some kind of common interface, since they are exactly the same, apart from the type they are parametrized by. Apparently, this is not the case automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example if you wish just to retrieve emails sent to a particular customer for a certain month then stocking them in an appropriate heirachy on the File System (zip them up if necessary) should be simple to do.  You might want to record a list of sent emails  in a database table with a &lt;em&gt;pointer&lt;/em&gt; to the appropriate directory but a naming convention for your directories and files might be sufficient&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might not need to access very old emails very infrequently so you might archive these to DVD for example if online storage is a problem&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're wanting to often search the actual content of emails then your going to have to put the content in a DB table or use an indexer like Lucerne to examine the files stocked on disk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see two situations that are of particular interest to me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) An OTS system meets the initial set of requirements with little to no modification, other than potential integration into an existing system. However, within a few iterations of development, this system no longer meets the needs without rewriting the core code. The developers must choose to either spend additional time learning the core code behind this OTS software or throw it away and build from scratch. Either would have a drastic impact on development time and project cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The initial needs are not like any existing OTS system available, however, in the end when the customer accepts the product, it ends up being much like existing solutions due to requirement additions and subtractions. If the developers had more requirements and spent more time working on them up front, this solution could have been used instead of building again. The project was delivered, but later and at a higher cost than necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a software engineer, part of my responsibilities (as I have been taught), are to deliver high-quality software to the customer on time at the lowest possible cost (among other things). Agile development allows for high-quality software, but in some cases, it might not be apparent that there are better alternatives until it is too late and too much money has been spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My questions are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does off-the-shelf software fit in with agile development?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do the agile manager and agile developer deal with these cases?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do the agile paradigms say about these cases?&lt;/li&gt;

I'm talking template files, JavaScript and CSS here. He's not stupid, it's just one of these things that makes his job harder so he resists fully commiting himself to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case I had to really hammer home the point that almost all of my JavaScript depended on the mark-up and when he changed his pure CSS, DIV-based layout into a table-based one without telling me then all my JS is going to break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often during the course of the project myself and the designer, who I get on with quite well and play soccer with outside of work, had very heated exchanges about our respective responsibilities. If I didn't know him well enough to just get past these exchanges then I think it would have created an unbearable working environment. So I think it's important you establish between you both and with some sort of manager or project supervisor exactly what is expected of both parties during the project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case there have been very few problems lately, because the situation with CVS has been sorted out as well as the idea that he can't just go and change the mark-up whenever he feels like it. Rather than try and create template files and work on them directly, the designer only works on static files and its my responsibility to plug them into my template files.&lt;/p&gt;

It could be that immediately after several lower ones free, leaving you with a higher descriptor than you might expect though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only reason I can think of to know this, though, is for the select function, which is sped up if you pass it the highest file descriptor you need to check for.&lt;/p&gt;

The way that I do it is that the libraries I need through the references of the project. Which basically just says in what folder to look for a specific library at project load time. I develop my libraries to be as project independent or reusable as possible. Therefore they are all projects of their own. So of the libraries that I need for a specific project, I create a "3rdParty" or "libs" folder at the same level as my "src" folder in my svn folder tree. I tend to only use released libraries, but when I get some unknown issues and want to switch to debug, I manually copy a debug version of the files in the "lib" folder and reload the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am unsure wether I should be keeping both debug and released versions in my svn tree. Although since they are projects of their own, keeping them in the svn tree of another project doesn't right. They can be built again without an hitch at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I wanted to find a way of making the switch more...hmmm...well basically automatic if you while, but that's not what I really mean. It just feels that switching the files manually between released and debug isn't right. Maybe I haven't found it yet, but what I would like is an option that would do like:
For library "stack.dll" look in "......\3rdParty\" for release and "......\3rdPartyD\" for debug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything that those something like I don't know. What do you suggest?
Remember libraries are external projects. There the built files are totally elsewhere. In fact think of it as you have to check out another project, build it, and copy the built library if you want another copy. How would you set that up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the database code, how often does it change ?  Are you looking at caching at the moment ?  I assume you have looked at indexes etc over the data to speed up the Db ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What levels of traffic do you have on the front end ?  Are you caching web pages ?  (It isn't too hard to say use a JMS type api to communicate between components.  You can then put Web Page component on one machine (or more), and then put the integration code (c++) on another, and for many JMS products there are usually native C++ api's ie. ActiveMQ comes to mind), but it really helps to know how much of the time is in Web (JSP ?) , C++, Database ops.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the database storing business data, or is it being also used to pass data between Java and C++ ?  You say you are using shared mem not JNI ?  What level of multi-threading currently exists in the APP?  Would you describe the code as being synchronous in nature or async? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a physical relationship between the Solaris code and the devices that must be maintained (ie. do all the devices register with the c++ code, or can that be specified).  ie. if you were to put a web load balancer on the frontend, and just put 2 machines up today is the relationhip of which devices are managed by a box initialized up front or in advance? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the HA requirements ? ie. just state info ? Can the HA be done just in the web tier by clustering Session data ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;parse the SQL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work up a query plan, i. e. decide on which indices to use (if any), optimize etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if an index is used, search it for the pointers to the actual data, then go to the appropriate location in the data or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if no index is used, scan &lt;i&gt;the whole table&lt;/i&gt; to determine which rows are needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;load the data from disk into a temporary location (hopefully, but not necessarily, memory)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;perform the count() and avg() calculations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, creating an array in Python and getting the average basically skips all these steps save the last one. As disk I/O is among the most expensive operations a program has to perform, this is a major flaw in the test (see also the answers to &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26021/how-is-data-compression-more-effective-than-indexing-for-search-performance"&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt; I asked here before). Even if you read the data from disk in your other test, the process is completely different and it's hard to tell how relevant the results are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To obtain more information about where Postgres spends its time, I would suggest the following tests:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare the execution time of your query to a SELECT without the aggregating functions (i. e. cut step 5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you find that the aggregation leads to a significant slowdown, try if Python does it faster, obtaining the raw data through the plain SELECT from the comparison.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To speed up your query, reduce disk access first. I doubt very much that it's the aggregation that takes the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's several ways to do that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cache data (in memory!) for subsequent access, either via the db engine's own capabilities or with tools like memcached&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce the size of your stored data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimize the use of indices. Sometimes this can mean to skip index use altogether (after all, it's disk access, too). For MySQL, I seem to remember that it's recommended to skip indices if you assume that the query fetches more than 10% of all the data in the table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your query makes good use of indices, I know that for MySQL databases it helps to put indices and data on separate physical disks. However, I don't know whether that's applicable for Postgres.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There also might be more sophisticated problems such as swapping rows to disk if for some reason the result set can't be completely processed in memory. But I would leave that kind of research until I run into serious performance problems that I can't find another way to fix, as it requires knowledge about a lot of little under-the-hood details in your process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I just realized that you seem to have no use for indices for the above query and most likely aren't using any, too, so my advice on indices probably wasn't helpful. Sorry. Still, I'd say that the aggregation is not the problem but disk access is. I'll leave the index stuff in, anyway, it might still have some use.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

ALLTASK: 10
OPENTASK: 7
CLOSEDTASK: 3

&lt;p&gt;Why don't you use your object type directly? You can set type of your setting on Project Properties-&gt;Settings tab. You can select your type by clicking on Browse in drop down for Type column.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citation from MSDN:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Application settings can be stored as
  any data type that is XML serializable
  or has a TypeConverter that implements
  ToString/FromString&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That way you can have strongly typed settings, i.e. (ValuationInput) Settings.Default.Properties["ValuationInput"].DefaultValue; will return an object instead of string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I have to agree with what everyone else is saying in regards to keeping any Office products off of a server; however, since you are doing Excel, it might be feasible for you to generate &lt;a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/HA102063961033.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;Excel XML documents&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Is there any way for me to pick apart this stack trace in a language-neutral manner, so that I can display only the file and line number for those entries that have this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can occur regardless off the OTS nature of the component. Agile does not mean near-sighted.. you'd need to know the big chunks.. the framework bits and spend thinking time on it beforehand. That said, you can only build to what you know .. Delay only till the last responsible moment.Then you need to pick one of the alternatives and start on it.  (I'd Avoid third party application unless the cost of developing it in-house is infeasible.. but that's just me). Prototype multiple solutions to check feasibility with list of known requirements. Keep things loosely coupled (replacable), easy to change and full tested. If you reach the fork of keep hacking or rewrite, you'd need to think of which has better value for the business and pick that option. It's comes down 'Now that we're here, what's the best we can do now?' &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Scenario2: &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can happen although the chances are slim compared to the team spending 2-3 months trying to get the requirements 'finalized' only to find that the market needs or customer minds have changed and 'Now we want it this way'. Once again, its a question of what is the point of time till which you are prepared to investigate and explore before committing on a path of action. Decide wisely with whatever information you have upto that point.. Hindsight is always 20-20 but the customers wont wait forever. You can't wait till the point of time where the requirements coalesce to fit a known OTS component :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agile says Do whatever makes sense and strip out the non-value-adding activities :) Agile is no magic bullet.&lt;/strong&gt; just my 2 agile cents :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My guess (without trying to re-produce it myself) is that a couple of things may be happening as the DataSet tries to 'flatten' a hierarchical structure to a relational data structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) thinking about the data from a relational database perspective; there is no obvious primary key field for identifying each of the Foo elements in the collection so the DataSet has automatically used the ordinal position in the file as an auto-generated field called Foo-Id.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) There are actually two elements called 'Foo' so that probably explains the generation of a strange name for the column 'Foo-Id-0' (it has auto-generated a unique name for the column - I guess you could think of this as a fault-tolerant behaviour in the DataSet).&lt;/p&gt;

This effectively serializes by graph, with each object instance being a node, and each reference being an edge. The algorithm used is recursive, but skipping duplicates.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;serialize(x):
    done - a set of serialized objects
    if(serialized(x, done)) then return
    otherwise:
         record properties of x

         for each neighbour/child of x: serialize(child)

&lt;p&gt;Another way of course is as a list of nodes and edges, which can be done as XML, or in any other preferred serialization format, or as an adjacency matrix.&lt;/p&gt;

Basically you have two (good) options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list"&gt;an adjacency list representation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix"&gt;an adjacency matrix representation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in which the adjacency list representation is best used for a sparse graph, and a matrix representation for the dense graphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you used suchs representations then you could serialize those representations instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it has to be &lt;em&gt;human readable&lt;/em&gt; you could still opt for creating your own serialization algorithm. For example you could write down the matrix representation like you would do with any "normal" matrix: just print out the columns and rows, and all the data in it like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;   1  2  3
1 #t #f #f
2 #f #f #t
3 #f #t #f
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(this is a non-optimized, non weighted representation, but can be used for directed graphs)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, the instant CPU usage for a process does not exists. Instead you have to make two measurements and calculate the average CPU usage, the formula is quite simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;AvgCpuUsed = [TotalCPUTime(process,time2) - TotalCPUTime(process,time1)] / [time2-time1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lower Time2 and Time1 difference is, the more "instant" your measurement will be. Windows Task Manager calculate the CPU use with an interval of one second. I've found that is more than enough and you might even consider doing it in 5 seconds intervals cause the act of measuring itself takes up CPU cycles...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, first, to get the average CPU time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    using System.Diagnostics;

float GetAverageCPULoad(int procID, DateTme from, DateTime, to)
{
  // For the current process
  //Process proc = Process.GetCurrentProcess();
  // Or for any other process given its id
  Process proc = Process.GetProcessById(procID);
  System.TimeSpan lifeInterval = (to - from);
  // Get the CPU use
  float CPULoad = (proc.TotalProcessorTime.TotalMilliseconds / lifeInterval.TotalMilliseconds) * 100;
  // You need to take the number of present cores into account
  return CPULoad / System.Environment.ProcessorCount;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now, for the "instant" CPU load you'll need an specialized class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; class ProcLoad
{
  // Last time you checked for a process
  public Dictionary&amp;lt;int, DateTime&amp;gt; lastCheckedDict = new Dictionary&amp;lt;int, DateTime&amp;gt;();

  public float GetCPULoad(int procID)
  {
    if (lastCheckedDict.ContainsKey(procID))
    {
      DateTime last = lastCheckedDict[procID];
      lastCheckedDict[procID] = DateTime.Now;
      return GetAverageCPULoad(procID, last, lastCheckedDict[procID]);
    }
    else
    {
      lastCheckedDict.Add(procID, DateTime.Now);
      return 0;
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should call that class from a timer (or whatever interval method you like) for &lt;strong&gt;each process you want to monitor&lt;/strong&gt;, if you want all the processes just use the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1f3ys1f9.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;Process.GetProcesses&lt;/a&gt; static method&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am producing parameterised queries containing user generated "WHERE" clauses and SELECT fields. Sometimes the queries are complex and I need a lot of control over how the different parts are built. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, I am using many loops and switch statements to produce the necessary SQL code fragments and to create the SQL parameters objects needed. This method is difficult to follow and it makes maintenance a real chore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a cleaner, more stable way of doing this??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any Suggestions??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT:
To add detail to my previous post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. I cannot really template my query due to the requirements. It just changes too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have to allow for aggregate functions, like Count(). This has consequences for the Group By/Having clause. it also causes nested SELECT statements. This in turn affects the column name used by &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some Contact data is stored in an XML column. Users can query this data AS WELL AS and the other relational columns together. Consequences are that xmlcolumns cannot appear in Group By clauses[sql syntax].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am using an efficient paging technique that uses Row_Number() SQL Function. Consequences are that I have to use a Temp table and then get the @@rowcount, before selecting my subset, to avoid a second query.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will show some code(the horror!) so that you guys have an idea of what i'm dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sqlCmd.CommandText = "DECLARE @t Table(ContactId int, ROWRANK int" + declare
      + ")INSERT INTO @t(ContactId, ROWRANK" + insertFields + ")"//Insert as few cols a possible
      + "Select ContactID, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY " + sortExpression + " "
      + sortDirection + ") as ROWRANK" // generates a rowrank for each row
      + outerFields
      + " FROM ( SELECT c.id AS ContactID"
      + coreFields
      + from         // sometimes different tables are required 
      + where + ") T " // user input goes here.
      + groupBy+ " "
      + havingClause //can be empty
      + ";"
      + "select @@rowcount as rCount;" // return 2 recordsets, avoids second query
      + " SELECT " + fields + ",field1,field2" // join onto the other cols n the table
      +" FROM @t t INNER JOIN contacts c on t.ContactID = c.id" 
      +" WHERE ROWRANK BETWEEN " + ((pageIndex * pageSize) + 1) + " AND " 
      + ( (pageIndex + 1) * pageSize); // here I select the pages I want
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In this Eg. I would be querying XML data. For purely relational data, the query is much more simple.
Each of the section variables are StringBuilders. Where clauses are built like so:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;//Add Parameter to SQL Command
AddParamToSQLCmd(sqlCmd, "@p" + z.ToString(), SqlDbType.VarChar, 50, ParameterDirection.Input, qc.FieldValue);
// Create SQL code Fragment
where.AppendFormat(" {0} {1} {2} @p{3}", qc.BooleanOperator, qc.FieldName, qc.ComparisonOperator, z);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be used to validate XML against a schema or compare your XML against a string. It is clever enough to understand XML's parsing rules.
For example it knows that "&amp;lt;e1/&amp;gt;" is equivalent to "&amp;lt;e1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/e1&amp;gt;" and can be configured to ignore or include whitespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each component of the query is represented by an Object (which in my case is a Linq-to-Sql entity that maps to a table in the DB). So I have the following classes: Query, SelectColumn, Join, WhereCondition, Sort, GroupBy. Each of these classes contains all details relating to that component of the query.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The last five classes are all related to a Query object. So the Query object itself has collections of each class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each class has a method that can generate the SQL for the part of the query that it represents. So creating the overall query ends up calling Query.GenerateQuery() which in turn enumerates through all of the sub-collections and calls their respective GenerateQuery() methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is still a bit complicated, but in the end you know where the SQL generation for each individual part of the query originates (and I don't think that there are any big switch statements). And don't forget to use StringBuilder.&lt;/p&gt;

For us, the way that the project/solutions work is not intuitive and leads to configuruation explosion when you are trying to tweak builds with specific compile time flags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Unix, it's pretty easy to set up a makefile that has its default options overridden by user settings (or other configuration setting).  But doing these types of things seems difficult in Visual Studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By way of example, we have a project that needs to get build for 3 different platforms.  Each platform might have several configurations (for example debug, release, and several others).  One of my goals on a newly formed project is to have a solution that can have all platform build living together, which makes building and testing code changes easier since you aren't having to open 3 different solutions just to test your code.  But visual studio will require 3 * (number of base configurations) configurations.  i.e. PC Debug, X360 Debug, PS3 Debug, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like a makefile solution is much better here.  Wrapped with some basic batchfiles or scripts, it would be easy to keep the configuration explotion to a minimum and only maintain a small set of files for all of the different builds that we have to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I have no experience with makefiles under visual studio and would like to know if others have experiences or issues that they can share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

I was saying that I didn't like his editor as much because it doesn't let you do find/replace with regular expressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said he's never wanted to do that, which was surprising since it's something I find myself doing all the time.  However, off the top of my head I wasn't able to come up with more than one or two examples.  Can anyone here offer some examples of times when they've found regex find/replace useful in their editor?  Here's what I've been able to come up with since then as examples of things that I've actually had to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strip the beginning of a line off of every line in a file that looks like:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Line 25634 :&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Line 632157 :&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a few dozen files with a standard header which is slightly different for each file and stripping the first 19 lines from all of them all at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Piping the result of a MySQL select statement into a text file, then removing all of the formatting junk and reformatting it as a Python dictionary for use in a simple script.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a CSV file with no escaped commas, replace the first character of the 8th column of each row with a capital A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given a bunch of GDB stack traces with lines like&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;#3  0x080a6d61 in _mvl_set_req_done (req=0x82624a4, result=27158) at ../../mvl/src/mvl_serv.c:850&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
strip out everything from each line except the function names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone else have any real-life examples?  The next time this comes up, I'd like to be more prepared to list good examples of why this feature is useful.&lt;/p&gt;

I measure the time(secs:millisecs) counsumed by my function. But i have some doubts about the accuracy of this measurement as the operating system will not continuously run my application, but instead schedule others apps/services in between the execution of my code.(Although i have no major applications running while i do the profile run, still windows will have lot of code of its own which it will run by preempting my app.). Because of all this i believe the profiling number(time taken by my app to run) is not accurate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is there any way to find out the Operating system overheads, scheduling overhead on a typical windows system(I run Windows XP)e.g. if my applications says it ran for 60 milliseconds, out of that 60 msec,  how much time really was used by my app. and how much time it was sitting idle, due to being pre-empted by some other task scheduled by the OS?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using PHP for web development, most of your connection will only "live" for the life of the page executing. A persistant connection is going to cost you a lot of overhead as you'll have to put it in the session or some such thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit0: Obviously the debug messages have some overhead of their own.  You may want to leave those in the code even when you are running from the debugger.  That way, both the standalone and the debugger are running the very same code.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit1: I misunderstood the question.  I thought your concern was that --while debugging--, the OS might interrupt your app more frequently than in a normal mode of execution.  If you want to know how much time your app actually spent working, just compare the time taken to the "CPU Time" in the Task Manager.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It's somewhat easier to manage the list of source files, include paths, preprocessor defines and so on, if they're all in a makefile or other build config file.  With multiple configurations, adding an include path means you need to make sure you update every config manually through Visual Studio's fiddly project properties, which can get pretty tedious as a project grows in size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Projects which use a lot of custom build tools can be easier to manage too, such as if you need to compile pixel / vertex shaders, or code in other languages without native VS support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll still need to have various different project configurations however, since you'll need to differentiate the invocation of the build tool for each config (e.g. passing in different command line options to make).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediate downsides that spring to mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slower builds: VS isn't particularly quick at invoking external tools, or even working out whether it needs to build a project in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Awkward inter-project dependencies: It's fiddly to set up so that a dependee causes the base project to build, and fiddlier to make sure that they get built in the right order.  I've had some success getting SCons to do this, but it's always a challenge to get working well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loss of some useful IDE features: Edit &amp;amp; Continue being the main one!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, you'll spend less time managing your project configurations, but more time coaxing Visual Studio to work properly with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to precompile the query and optimization plan? I would have thought the stored procedure would do this, but it doesn't really help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid disk access it's necessary to cache the whole table in memory, can I force Postgres to do that?  I think it's already doing this though, since the query executes in just 200 ms after repeated runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can I tell Postgres that the table is read only, so it can optimize any locking code?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it's possible to estimate the query construction costs with an empty table (timings range from 20-60 ms) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still can't see why the Java/Python tests are invalid.  Postgres just isn't doing that much more work (though I still haven't addressed the concurrency aspect, just the caching and query construction)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: 
I don't think it's fair to compare the SELECTS as suggested by pulling 350,000 through the driver and serialization steps into Python to run the aggregation, nor even to omit the aggregation as the overhead in formatting and displaying is hard to separate from the timing.  If both engines are operating on in memory data, it should be an apples to apples comparison, I'm not sure how to guarantee that's already happening though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it's not an option to create all classes of GIS data because classes are created dynamically in the application. Every GIS data of the same type should be a class, but my user has the possibility to get new set of data and put it in the database. I can't know in front which classes my user will have in the application. Therefore, the in-front per-class mapping model doesn't work because tomorrow there will be another new database table, and a need to create new class with new mapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@all
There might be a possibility to write my own custom query in the XML config file of my GisObject class, then in the data access class fetching that query using the &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;string qs = getSession().getNamedQuery(queryName);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and use the string replace to inject database name (by replacing some placeholder string) which i will pass as a parameter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;qs = qs.replace(":tablename:", tableName);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you feel about that solution? I know it might be a security risk in an uncontrolled environment where the table name would be fetched as the user input, but in this case, i have a meta table containing right and valid table names for the GIS data classes which i will read before calling the query for fetching data for the specific class of GIS objects.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The BigInteger type is an immutable type that represents an arbitrarily large integer whose value in theory has no upper or lower bounds. This type differs from the other integral types in the .NET Framework, which have a range indicated by their MinValue and MaxValue properties.&lt;/p&gt;

      {
      // Wait

&lt;p&gt;Ahhhh! I see now, yes, I have had similar problems with SiteMap performing full comparison of the string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since changing the other source code (i.e. the search) is out of the question, I would probably say it may be best to do a Replace on the string. Although to be fair, if you often encounter code similar to this, it would equally be just as quick to set up a utility function to clone the collection, taking an array of values to filter from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the values don't have to be 100% spot on, or if the table is updated rarely, but you are running this calculation often, you might want to look into Materialized Views to speed it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note, I have not used materialized views in Postgres, they look at little hacky, but might suite your situation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://jonathangardner.net/tech/w/PostgreSQL/Materialized_Views"&gt;Materialized Views&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also consider the overhead of actually connecting to the server and the round trip required to send the request to the server and back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd consider 200ms for something like this to be pretty good, A quick test on my oracle server, the same table structure with about 500k rows and no indexes, takes about 1 - 1.5 seconds, which is almost all just oracle sucking the data off disk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real question is, is 200ms fast enough?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-------------- More --------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was interested in solving this using materialized views, since I've never really played with them. This is in oracle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I created a MV which refreshes every minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;create materialized view mv_so_x 
build immediate 
refresh complete 
START WITH SYSDATE NEXT SYSDATE + 1/24/60
 as select count(*),avg(a),avg(b),avg(c),avg(d) from so_x;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While its refreshing, there is no rows returned&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SQL&amp;gt; select * from mv_so_x;

no rows selected

Elapsed: 00:00:00.00
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once it refreshes, its MUCH faster than doing the raw query&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SQL&amp;gt; select count(*),avg(a),avg(b),avg(c),avg(d) from so_x;

  COUNT(*)     AVG(A)     AVG(B)     AVG(C)     AVG(D)
---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
   1899459 7495.38839 22.2905454 5.00276131 2.13432836

Elapsed: 00:00:05.74
SQL&amp;gt; select * from mv_so_x;

  COUNT(*)     AVG(A)     AVG(B)     AVG(C)     AVG(D)
---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
   1899459 7495.38839 22.2905454 5.00276131 2.13432836

Elapsed: 00:00:00.00
SQL&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we insert into the base table, the result is not immediately viewable view the MV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SQL&amp;gt; insert into so_x values (1,2,3,4,5);

1 row created.

Elapsed: 00:00:00.00
SQL&amp;gt; commit;

Commit complete.

Elapsed: 00:00:00.00
SQL&amp;gt; select * from mv_so_x;

  COUNT(*)     AVG(A)     AVG(B)     AVG(C)     AVG(D)
---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
   1899459 7495.38839 22.2905454 5.00276131 2.13432836

Elapsed: 00:00:00.00
SQL&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait a minute or so, and the MV will update behind the scenes, and the result is returned fast as you could want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SQL&amp;gt; /

  COUNT(*)     AVG(A)     AVG(B)     AVG(C)     AVG(D)
---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
   1899460 7495.35823 22.2905352 5.00276078 2.17647059

Elapsed: 00:00:00.00
SQL&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn't ideal. for a start, its not realtime, inserts/updates will not be immediately visible. Also, you've got a query running to update the MV whether you need it or not (this can be tune to whatever time frame, or on demand). But, this does show how much faster an MV can make it seem to the end user, if you can live with values which aren't quite upto the second accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a query for it, populate it, send it disconnected. This way the user will be able to group values and play a little, but he will not be able to refresh the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate a small access database and send it along with the excel file, connect to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the data to the excel (perhaps in some other sheet) and connect to the data there. This will make the excel file very large I think.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on your comment - UML is a generic, language-independent model. It's designed (from my understanding) to be used before an implementation language is chosen, so not all of the UML elements have corresponding elements in all languages (eg - interfaces in Ruby).

In order to pull off some of the visual tricks of draging around the tree node, it has to be copied into this clipboard with its source description.  The source control loads its info into the &lt;code&gt;FORMATETC&lt;/code&gt; clipboard and sends it to the target object.  It looks like the error occurs on the drop and not on the drag. The &lt;code&gt;DV&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;DV_E_FORMATETC&lt;/code&gt; typically indicates the error occurrs on the drop step.&lt;br /&gt;
The destination doesn't look like it likes what you are droping on it. The clipboard may be corrupt or the drop destination may not be configured to understand it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend you try one of two things.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the original tree structure and destination. Dump your dlls.  Close everything.  Open up and put the treeview and destination back on the form.  It may have just been poorly formed and not fully populating the &lt;code&gt;FORMATETC&lt;/code&gt; structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try putting another treeview and droping to that.  If you are droping to another tree and it works you know your oranges to oranges work and it isn't the treeview.  It may be the destination if it is a grid or listview.  You may need to change those structures to be able to receive the drop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not that it helps but the structure is something like this:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;typedef struct tagFORMATETC
{
  CLIPFORMAT      cfFormat;
  DVTARGETDEVICE  *ptd;
  DWORD           dwAspect;
  LONG            lindex;
  DWORD           tymed;

&lt;p&gt;What I usually do i these cases where you have quite a bit of data, is to use an existing sql-server already on the network. If it is to be used at the office, the users will by online anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember to create a dedicated user with restriced access on the sql-server for this report and don't store the "sa" password in the excel-file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you by "sent to the users" mean users outside of the office, this would not be a good solution. If that is the case, I would try to include the data in the excel-sheet and see how big it will become. That will be the most user friendly solution if the file is not too big.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, i found this online: &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa203721(office.11).aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;Different Ways of Using Web Queries in Microsoft Office Excel 2003&lt;/a&gt;. That will let you store the data on a public website (with a secret URL if you want) and then let Excel pull the data. That way you do not have to fill the users inbox with large files, and you can also update the data later without resending the excel-file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new class exposes these methods as 'public', so they're accessible for unit testing.  The new and old classes are now both simpler than the original class, which is great for me (I need to keep things simple, or I get lost!).&lt;/p&gt;

They talk about this distinction in very vague terms without going into much detail or discussing the pros and cons much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the real difference here and how much does it matter?  What are other languages then are "object-oriented"?  It sounded pretty interesting but I don't want to have to learn Ruby just to know what if anything I am missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: After reading some of the answers below it seems like people generally agree that the reference is to duck-typing.  What I'm not sure I understand still though is the claim that this ultimately changes all that much.  Especially if you are already doing proper tdd with loose coupling blah blah blah.  Can someone show me an example of a wonderous thing I could do with ruby that I cannot do with c# and that exemplifies this different oop approach?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a stored procedure that accepts all possible parameters, and then use something like this in the where clause:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;where...
and (@MyParam5 is null or @MyParam5 = Col5)

&lt;p&gt;Python and Ruby are duck-typed. To generate any maintainable code in these languages, you pretty much have to use test driven development. As such, it is very important for a developer to easily inject dependencies into their code without having to create a giant supporting framework. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful dependency-injection depends upon on having a pretty good object model. The two are sort of two sides of the same coin. If you really understand how to use OOP, then you should by default create designs where dependencies can be easily injected. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because dependency injection is easier in dynamically typed languages, the Ruby/Python developers feel like their language understands the lessons of OO much better than other statically typed counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

Conversely, in C# for example, you define &lt;em&gt;classes&lt;/em&gt; that you then must &lt;em&gt;instantiate&lt;/em&gt; into object by way of the new keyword.  The key point being you must &lt;em&gt;declare&lt;/em&gt; a class in C# or describe it.  Additionally, in Ruby, &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; -- even numbers, for example -- is an object.  In contrast, C# still retains the concept of an object type and a value type.  This in fact, I think illustrates the point they make about C# and other similar languages -- object &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; and value &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; imply a &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; system, meaning you have an entire system of &lt;em&gt;describing&lt;/em&gt; types as opposed to just working with objects.&lt;/p&gt;

I would still argue that from a more common and broader definition, C# and the others are still &lt;em&gt;object-oriented&lt;/em&gt; languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think query round trip time should be very high as i'm running the the queries on the same machine that runs Postgres, so it can't add much latency?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've also done some checking into the cache sizes, and it seems Postgres relies on the OS to handle caching, they specifically mention BSD as the ideal OS for this, so I thinking Mac OS ought to be pretty smart about bringing the table into memory.  Unless someone has more specific params in mind I think more specific caching is out of my control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end I can probably put up with 200 ms response times, but knowing that 7 ms is a possible target makes me feel unsatisfied, as even 20-50 ms times would enable more users to have more up to date queries and get rid of a lots of caching and precomputed hacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just checked the timings using MySQL 5 and they are slightly worse than Postgres.  So barring some major caching breakthroughs, I guess this is what I can expect going the relational db route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've heard some objections to this approach, but few of them have been convincing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It hurts performance&lt;/strong&gt; Bah, I say!  Don't optimize without hard data!  Perhaps if you are planning your assemblies to be downloaded over slow links, then minimizing assembly size would be worthwhile.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's a security risk&lt;/strong&gt;.  Only if you have secrets in your tests.  Don't do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, your situation is different from mine, so maybe it'll make sense for you, and maybe it won't.  You'll have to figure that out yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside: In C#, I once tried putting my unit tests in a class named "Tests" that was nested inside the class that it was testing.  This made the correct organization of things obvious.  It also avoided the duplication of names that occurs when tests for the class "Foo" are in a class called "FooTests".  However, the unit testing frameworks that I had access to refused to accept tests that weren't marked "public".  This means that the class that you're testing can't be "private".  I can't think of any good reason to require tests to be "public", since no one really calls them as public methods - everything is through reflection.  If you ever write a unit testing framework for .Net, please consider allowing non-public tests, for my sake!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Adobe Actionscript is a statically typed language, Javascript is dynamically typed.  Depending on your point of view, this may be a good thing or a bad thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With Javascript/HTML/CSS you're going to be heading into cross-browser compatibility hell, especially if you want to support older browsers.  This can be mitigated by the libraries that are available, but it's still a big headache.  With Flash, you write the code once and it just works in all browsers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even with the libraries available, Flash user controls are simply more advanced than anything you can find in the world of Javascript/HTML.  In Javascript, you are not going to find anything that comes close to the simplicity and power of a databound user control that Flash provides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't see how Javascript has more of a "market share" than Flash.  Pretty much anyone with a web browser has a Flash plugin installed.  I'd be curious to know how many people disable Javascript but have a Flash plugin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also keep in mind that you're going to be in for a huge learning curve and lots of development time if you decide to switch your technology base so you'd really better have a good business reason to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This decision also has a lot to do with what your application does and who your install base is.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace FormName with the name of your form and then all the fields will be reset when the user clicks refresh in his browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or if you only want to reset some fields, add this to the bottom of your page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script type="text/javascript"&amp;gt;
    document.getElementById('field1').value ='';
    document.getElementById('field2').value ='';
    document.getElementById('field3').value ='';
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That will reset the fields every time a user enters the page, including refreshes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run this from a terminal and all kbd events should hit it.  I'm testing it under Xorg
but it uses venerable, stable Xlib mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BE CAREFUL with grabs under X.  When you're new to them, sometimes it's a good
idea to start a time delay process that will ungrab the server when you're
testing code and let it sit and run and ungrab every couple of minutes.
It saves having to kill or switch away from the server to externally reset state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here, I'll leave it to you to decide how to multiplex renderes.  Read
the XGrabKeyboard docs and XEvent docs to get started.
If you have small windows exposed at the screen corners, you could jam
the pointer into one corner to select a controller.  XWarpPointer can
shove the pointer to one of them as well from code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more point:  you can grab the pointer as well, and other resources.  If you had one controller running on the box in front of which you sit, you could use keyboard and mouse input to switch it between open sockets with different renderers.  You shouldn't need to resize the output window to less than full screen anymore with this approach, ever.  With more work, you could actually drop alpha-blended overlays on top using the SHAPE and COMPOSITE extensions to get a nice overlay feature in response to user input (which might count as gilding the lily).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://getfirebug.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;FireBug&lt;/a&gt; - a myriad of productivity enhancing tools, includes javascript debugger, DOM inspector, allows you to edit the CSS/HTML on the fly which is highly valuable for troubleshooing layout and display problems.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60" rel="nofollow"&gt;Web Developer&lt;/a&gt; - again another great developer productivity tool.  I mostly use it for quickly validating pages, disabling javascript (yes I disable javascript sometimes, don't you?),  viewing cookies, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/966" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tamper Data&lt;/a&gt; - lets you tamper with http headers, form values, cookies, etc. prior to posting back to a page, or getting a page.  Incredibly valuable for poking and prodding your pages, and seeing how your web app responds when used with slightly malicious intent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/216" rel="nofollow"&gt;JavaScript Debugger&lt;/a&gt; - has a few more features than javascript debugger provided by firebug.  Although I must admit, I sparingly use this one since firebug has largely won me over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3829" rel="nofollow"&gt;Live HTTP Headers&lt;/a&gt; - invaluable for troubleshooting, use it frequently.  Lets you spy on all HTTP headers communicated back and forth between client and server.  It has helped me track down nefarious problems, especially when debugging issues when deploying your web app between environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4276" rel="nofollow"&gt;Header Spy&lt;/a&gt; - nice addon for the geeky types, shows you the web server and platform a web site runs on in the status bar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/539" rel="nofollow"&gt;MeasureIt&lt;/a&gt; - I don't use this all too frequently, but I've still found it valuable from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/271" rel="nofollow"&gt;ColorZilla&lt;/a&gt; - again, not something I use all that frequently, but when I need it, I need it.  Valuable when you want to know a color and you don't want to dig through a CSS file, or open up a graphics editing app to get a color embedded in some image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/573" rel="nofollow"&gt;Add N Edit Cookies&lt;/a&gt; - this has been a great debugging tool in web farms where the load balancer writes a cookie, and uses the cookie value to keep your session "sticky".  It allowed me to switch at will between servers to track down problems on specific machine. Also a good tool if you want to try to mess with a site that uses cookies to track your login status/account, and you want to see how your code responds to malformed or hacked info.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1944" rel="nofollow"&gt;Yellowpipe Lynx Viewer Tool&lt;/a&gt; - yeah I know what your thinking, lynx, who needs it, its so 1994.  But if you are developing a site that needs to take web accessibility into account (meaning accessible to users with visual impairments who use screen readers), or if you need to get a sense of how a web spider/indexer "sees" your site, this tool is invaluable.  Granted, you could always just go out and grab Lynx for yourself&lt;a href="http://www.vordweb.co.uk/standards/download_lynx.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;here's the windows xp port that I use&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've got a handful of other addons that I've used from time to time that I'll just quickly mention: FireFTP (one I installed wasn't stable and I've not tried a newer release), Html Validator (also found this one unstable, least back when I installed like a year ago),  IE Tab (I usually just have both IE and FireFox open concurrently, but that is just me, I know many others that find this addon useful).&lt;/p&gt;

A few years ago I purchased the set of Art of Computer Programming by Donald Knuth. After looking at the books I realized pretty much everything is calculus proofs. If you're interested in developing your own generic algorithms and proofs for them, then I recommend being able to understand the above books since its what you'd be dealing with in that world. On the other hand if you only want/need to use various sorting/searching/tree/etc... routines then big O notation at a minimum, boolean math, and general algebra will be fine. If you're dealing with 3D then geometry and trig as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tend to be more on the using side than making proofs, and while I'd like to think I've done some clever things over the years I've never sat down and developed a new sorting routine. The best advice I can give is learn what you need for your field, but expose yourself to higher levels so you know it exists and how much more there is to learn, you won't get much growth otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Implement RFC 2217&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rfc-archive.org/getrfc.php?rfc=2217" rel="nofollow"&gt;RFC 2217&lt;/a&gt; covers a com port to TCP/IP standard that allows a client on one system to emulate a serial port to the local programs, while transparently sending and receiving data and control signals to a server on another system which actually has the serial port.  Here's a &lt;a href="http://pcmicro.com/support/rfc2217.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;high-level overview&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you would do is find or implement a client com port driver that would implement the client side of the system on your PC - appearing to be a real serial port but in reality shuttling everything to a server.  You might be able to get this driver for free from Digi, Lantronix, etc in support of their real standalone serial port servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would then implement the server side of the connection locally in another program - allowing the client to connect and issuing the data and control commands as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's probably non trivial, but the RFC is out there, and you might be able to find an open source project that implements one or both sides of the connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Modify the linux serial port driver&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternately, the serial port driver source for Linux is readily available.  Take that, gut the hardware control pieces, and have that one driver run two /dev/ttySx ports, as a simple loopback.  Then connect your real program to the ttyS2 and your simulator to the other ttySx.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Use two USB&amp;lt;--&gt;Serial cables in a loopback&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the easiest thing to do right now?  Spend $40 on two serial port USB devices, wire them together (null modem) and actually have two real serial ports - one for the program you're testing, one for your simulator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unconstrained use of memory addresses (either GOTO or raw pointers) provides too many opportunities to make easily avoidable mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more ways there are to arrive at a particular "location" in the code, the less confident one can be about what the state of the system is at that point. (See below.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structured programming IMHO is less about "avoiding GOTOs" and more about making the structure of the code match the structure of the data. For example, a repeating data structure (e.g. array, sequential file, etc.) is naturally processed by a repeated unit of code. Having built-in structures (e.g. while, for, until, for-each, etc.) allows the programmer to avoid the tedium of repeating the same cliched code patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if GOTO is low-level implementation detail (not always the case!) it's below the level that the programmer should be thinking. How many programmers balance their personal checkbooks in raw binary? How many programmers worry about which sector on the disk contains a particular record, instead of just providing a key to a database engine (and how many ways could things go wrong if we really wrote all of our programs in terms of physical disk sectors?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Footnotes to the above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Re point 2, consider the following code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a = b + 1
/* do something with a */
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the "do something" point in the code, we can state with high confidence that a is greater than b. (Yes, I'm ignoring the possibility of untrapped integer overflow. Let's not bog down a simple example.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if the code had read this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;...
goto 10
...
a = b + 1
10: /* do something with a */
...
goto 10
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The multiplicity of ways to get to label 10 means that we have to work much harder to be confident about the relationships between a and b at that point. (In fact, in the general case it's undecideable!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Re point 4, the whole notion of "going someplace" in the code is just a metaphor. Nothing is really "going" anywhere inside the CPU except electrons and photons (for the waste heat). Sometimes we give up a metaphor for another, more useful, one. I recall encountering (a few decades ago!) a language where&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (some condition) {
  action-1
} else {
  action-2
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

I use Juice on a server to download all the podcasts that I listen to.  The script uses .Net methods to release the COM objects.  When I wrote my iTunes script I had read a couple of articles that stated you should release your COM objects using .NET.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
    [void][System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::ReleaseComObject([System.__ComObject]$LibrarySource)
    [void][System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::ReleaseComObject([System.__ComObject]$iTunes)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also run my scripts the majority of time from a shortcut, not from the powershell prompt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on your comments, I did some testing and I determined that I would get the message when running against iTunes, if I ran my script in a way that leaves powershell running.  iTunes seems to keep track of that.  Running the script in a manner that exits it's process after running, eliminated the message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One method of running your script from powershell, is to prefix your script with powershell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;powershell .\scriptname.ps1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above command will launch your script and then exit the process that was used to run it, but still leaving you at the powershell prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In C#, a switch case cannot fall through to other cases, this causes a compilation error.  In this case I am just adding some number to the month total for the selected month and each subsequent month thereafter. (simple example, not meant to be real) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;switch (month)
{
    case 0:
      add something to month totals
    case 1:

      add something to month totals
    default:
      break;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a logical alternative to this in C# without having to write out a ton of if statements?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (month &amp;lt;= 0)
   add something to month
if (month &amp;lt;= 1)
   add something to month
if (month &amp;lt;= 2)
   add something to month
.... etc

&lt;p&gt;When the test database got fuller with test data, this lead to a very visible slowdown while openening new forms etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I refactored it to the following, which - according to later quick 'n dirty measurements - is about 2 orders of magnitude faster:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;bool HasRight(string rightName, DomainObject obj) {
  return _user.Rights.Contains(rightName);
}

void CheckRight(string rightName, DomainObject obj) {
  if (!HasRight(rightName, obj))
    throw new Exception();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in short, using exceptions in normal process flow is about two orders of magnitude slower then using similar process flow without exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discrete mathematics and combinatorics are tremendously helpful in understanding the performance of various algorithms and data structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set theory is the basis of relational databases and SQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By way of analogy, let me point out that carpenters routinely use a variety of rule-of-thumb techniques in constructing things like roofs and stairs. However, a knowledge of geometry allows you to solve problems for which you don't have a "canned" rule of thumb. It's like learning to read via phonetics versus sight-recognition of a basic vocabulary. 90+% of the time there's not much difference. But when you run into an unfamiliar situation, it's VERY nice to have the tools to work out the solution yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the rigor/precision required by mathematics is very useful preparation for programming, regardless of specific technique. Again, many of the bugs in programming (or even specifications) that I've seen in my career have sloppy thinking at their root cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another strategy would be to take each object and examine its members by reflection and add up the sizes (boolean &amp;amp; byte = 1 byte, short &amp;amp; char = 2 bytes, etc.), working your way down the membership hierarchy.  But that's tedious and expensive and ends up doing the same thing the serialization strategy would do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. You want the &lt;a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iostream/ios/rdbuf.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;rdbuf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, there is little or NO performance penalty in actually having try-catch blocks in your code. This should not be a consideration when trying to avoid having them in your application. The performance hit only comes into play when an exception is thrown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When an exception is thrown in addition to the stack unwinding operations etc that take place which others have mentioned you should be aware that a whole bunch of runtime/reflection related stuff happens in order to populate the members of the exception class such as the stack trace object and the various type members etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that this is one of the reasons why the general advice if you are going to rethrow the exception is to just &lt;code&gt;throw;&lt;/code&gt; rather than throw the exception again or construct a new one as in those cases all of that stack information is regathered whereas in the simple throw it is all preserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Just allocating an object has some overhead in the JVM.  The amount varies by JVM so you might make this value a parameter.  At least make it a constant (8 bytes?) and apply to anything allocated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just because &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt; is theoretically 1 byte doesn't mean it takes just one in memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There will be loops in object references, so you'll need to keep a &lt;code&gt;HashMap&lt;/code&gt; or somesuch &lt;em&gt;using object-equals as the comparator&lt;/em&gt; to eliminate infinite loops.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@&lt;a href="#52362"&gt;jodonnell&lt;/a&gt;: I like the simplicity of your solution, but many objects aren't Serializable (so this would throw an exception), fields can be transient, and objects can override the standard methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some fixed overhead per object. It's JVM-specific, but I usually estimate 40 bytes. Then you have to look at the members of the class. Object references are 4 (8) bytes in a 32-bit (64-bit) JVM. Primitive types are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boolean and byte: 1 byte&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;char and short: 2 bytes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;int and float: 4 bytes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long and double: 8 bytes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arrays follow the same rules; that is, it's an object reference so that takes 4 (or 8) bytes in your object, and then its length multiplied by the size of its element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to do it programmatically with calls to &lt;code&gt;Runtime.freeMemory()&lt;/code&gt; just doesn't give you much accuracy, because of asynchronous calls to the garbage collector, etc. Profiling the heap with -Xrunhprof or other tools will give you the most accurate results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, I added some private files in my checkout that I want to keep, but they only exist for me and wouldn't make sense to be ignored for everyone, so if I use the svn:ignore, this will apply on the directory, and I either have to check that in (which I don't want to do), or see that this directory was modified every time I do an svn status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, ideally I would like something like a .svnignore file which I could then mark to ignore itself as well as some other files (I think this is a possibility in git for example, using a .gitignore file, or whatever the name is).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm guessing it might work to ignore the whole directory (maybe), but then I suspect I won't see any new files in that directory, which would also not be desirable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm working on a regression testing app.  I'm displaying a form on the screen and according to which user is logged in to the app some of the fields should be read-only.  So I can abstract a field object and I can abstract a user object but what pattern should I be looking at to describe the intersection of these two concepts?  In other words how should I describe that for Field 1 and User A, the field should be read-only?  It seems like read-only (or not) should be a property of the Field class but as I said, it depends on which user is looking at the form.  I've considered a simple two-dimensional array (e. g. ReadOnly[Field,User] = True) but I want to make sure I've picked the most effective structure to represent this.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any software design patterns regarding this kind of data structure?  Am I overcomplicating things--would a two-dimensional array be the best way to go here?

You could mean the object itself, with just its members, the Object and all objects it refers to (the reference graph). You could mean the size in memory or the size on disk. And the JVM is allowed to optimise things like Strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the only correct way is to ask the JVM, which a good profiler (I use &lt;a href="http://www.yourkit.com"&gt;YourKit&lt;/a&gt;), which probably isn't what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, from the description above it sounds like each row will be self-contained, and not have a big dependency tree, so the serialization method will probably be a good approximation on most JVMs. The easiest way to do this is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; Serializable ser;
 ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
 ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(baos);
 oos.writeObject(ser);
 oos.close();
 return baos.size();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that if you have objects with common references this &lt;em&gt;will not&lt;/em&gt; give the correct result, and size of serialization will not always match size in memory, but it is a good approximation. The code will be a bit more efficient if you initialise the ByteArrayOutputStream size to a sensible value.&lt;/p&gt;

Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;MERGE database2..targetTable AS t
USING (SELECT sourceColumn FROM sourceDatabase1..sourceTable) as s

&lt;p&gt;We are implementing a process of &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Business Requirements Statement (BRS)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Functional Specification&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Technical specification&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BRS covers what the business problems are, and what the requirements are around solutions, testing, security, reliability and delivery. This defines what would make a successful solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The functional spec details what is needed, how it should look, how long fields should be, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical spec details where the data comes from, any tricky code that may need to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The customer owns the requirements. The developers own the tech specs, and the functional spec is a middle ground. Testing is done against the tech specs (usually unit testing) then against the functional specs (usually system testing) and then against the requirements (UAT).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important part of this (and we are struggling with) is that the developers still need to deliver to the functional spec, and the original business requirements. In reality the functional and tech specs are just there for clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, my main tip is to first work out the process you wish to implement. Then seek agreement from all parties involved in your proposed process, then work on the templates to fit. The templates themselves are only are a small part of the change you want to make.&lt;/p&gt;

    public string Question { get; set; }
    public string Answer { get; set; }

&lt;p&gt;Now I make an ICollection of these available through an ObjectDataSource, and display them using a Repeater bound to the DataSource.  I use &lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;%#Eval("Question")%&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to display the Question, and I use a TextBox and &lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;%#Bind("Answer")%&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to accept an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If my ObjectDataSource returns three Question objects, then my Repeater displays the three questions with a TextBox following each question for the user to provide an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far it works great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I want to take the user's response and put it back into the relevant Question classes, which I will then persist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surely the framework should take care of all of this for me?  I've used the Bind method, I've specified a DataSourceID, I've specified an Update method in my ObjectDataSource class, but there seems no way to actually kickstart the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried adding a Command button and in the code behind calling MyDataSource.Update(), but it attempts to call my Update method with no parameters, rather than the Question parameter it expects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surely there's an easy way to achieve all of this with little or no codebehind?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like all the bits are there, but there's some glue missing to stick them all together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Office tools (unless web-based limitations can be lifted... which would require much better-performing web browsers than we have now)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photoshop and such tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chat clients (web-based equivalents are disappointing so far)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main piece of software I write controls electronic hardware (PXI boards and the like) for testing.  Without "real" hardware, there's nothing to test.  Even the very nature of the tests themselves prevent simultaneous access (once you set the state of a switch, you don't want someone else moving it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as long as you interact with any hardware, you're off-the-cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linear algebra and trigonometry (3D visualization)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discrete mathematics and set theory (database design, algorithm design, compiler design).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Physics (for simulations).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding functions is also useful (don't remember what the mathematical term is for that area), but if you know how to program you probably already do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point being: A ten year old should know enough mathematics to be able to understand programming. There isn't really much math required for the basic understanding of things. It's all about the logic, really.&lt;/p&gt;

This works until I give the textbox a padding. This is then added to the content width and the input field overflows. Notice that in Firefox this only happens when rendering the content as standards compliant. In quirks mode, another box model seems to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a minimal code to reproduce the behaviour in all modern browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

                padding: 0 20px;
                width: 100%;
            }

            input {
                background: red;
                padding: 0 20px;
                width: 100%;
            }
        &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;div id="x"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;div id="y"&amp;gt;x&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;input type="text"/&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question: &lt;strong&gt;How do I get the textbox to fit the container?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notice&lt;/em&gt;: for the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div id="y"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, this is straightforward: simply set &lt;code&gt;width: auto&lt;/code&gt;. However, if I try to do this for the textbox, the effect is different and the textbox takes its default row count as width (even if I set &lt;code&gt;display: block&lt;/code&gt; for the textbox).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/EDIT: &lt;a href="#52633"&gt;David's solution&lt;/a&gt; would of course work. However, I do not want to modify the HTML I do especially not want to add dummy elements with no semantic functionality. This is a typical case of &lt;a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Citations:divitis"&gt;divitis&lt;/a&gt; that I want to avoid at all cost. This can only be a last-resort hack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your generic approach, I'm not sure why you chose to limit the length of the TLD in your regex?  It's not very future-proof, and I'm unsure what benefit it's providing?  It's actually not even "now-proof" because there's at least one 6-character TLD out there (.museum) which won't be matched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems unnecessary to me to do this.  Couldn't you just do &lt;code&gt;^[^.]+\.[^.]\+$&lt;/code&gt;? (note: the question-mark is part of the sentence, not the regex!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that aside, there is a bigger problem with this approach that is: it will fail for domains that aren't directly beneath the TLD.  This is domains in Australia, UK, Japan, and many other countries, who have hierarchies: .co.jp, .co.uk, .com.au, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether or not that is of any concern to the OP, I don't know but it's something to be aware of if you're after a "fix all" answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OP hasn't yet made it clear whether he wants a generic solution or a solution for a single (or small group) of known domains.  If it's the latter, see my other note about using Zigdon's approach.  If it's the former, then proceed with Vinko's approach taking into account the information in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: One thing I've left out until now, which may or may not be an option for you business-wise, is to go the other way.  All our sites redirect &lt;a href="http://www.domain.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.domain.com&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://domain.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://domain.com&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driven:&lt;/strong&gt;
Too often the author drives the meeting, explaining why she did this and that.  Sometimes it's questioned, but often the participants are playing a matching game (i.e. "Yup, that's what she did") rather than thinking deeply about the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shallow:&lt;/strong&gt;  To understand complex code takes thought.  You have to look up related code in other files.  You have to run through possibilities of error-handling and thread synchronization.  When you're being walked through the code there's no time for finding the subtle problems -- exactly the ones that are hardest to find later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Context in Code:&lt;/strong&gt;  The next developer who has to understand or maintain the code won't have the benefit of the author walking him through it.  Too often reviewers accept what is told them because it makes sense in the conversation, but the confusing/important comments don't make it into the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time:&lt;/strong&gt;  Meetings take more time than lone reviews.  It's also easy to get sidetracked on tangential discussions.  A good moderator can mitigate this problem.  It's hard to schedule when people are separated by many timezones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concessions:&lt;/strong&gt;  I agree that walkthroughs can be a better forum for teaching new developers and generally sharing and learning from each other.  Instructive conversations happen that don't happen during lone reviews.  Sometimes it's nice to have multiple people in the room, especially when there's a domain expert plus a language expert plus a product guru.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I suggest defaulting with code reviews, but at the same time don't prevent people from doing walkthroughs when they find it useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Version control is not only usefull for rolling back versions. It will give a lot of safety against rolling out older versions of files or accidentally overwriting newer versions with older versions etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I'm only now getting used to that's really usefull is the ability to branch and merge different versions. If you have a deadline coming up but you're working on a new feature that's not ready for prime time you can just branch before you started adding that feature. Create a deliverable version without that feature and merge those two after the deadline passes without problems.&lt;/p&gt;

If you have some network technical knowledge, it really isn't that bad.  Otherwise you will be better off using Paypal or another type of service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process starts by getting a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2556/whats-the-best-online-payment-processing-solution"&gt;merchant account&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; setup and tied to your bank account.  You may want to check with your bank, because a lot of major banks provide merchant services.  You may be able to get deals, because you are already a customer of theirs, but if not, then you can shop around.  If you plan on accepting Discover or American Express, those will be separate, because they provide the merchant services for their cards, no getting around this.  There are other special cases also.  This is an application process, be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next you will want to purchase an &lt;strong&gt;SSL certificate&lt;/strong&gt; that you can use for securing your communications for when the credit card info is transmitted over public networks.  There are plenty of vendors, but my rule of thumb is to pick one that is a brand name in a way.  The better they are known, the better your customer has probably heard of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next you will want to find a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_gateway"&gt;payment gateway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to use with your site.  Although this can be optional depending on how big you are, but majority of the time it won't be.  You will need one.  The payment gateway vendors provide a way to talk to the Internet Gateway API that you will communicate with.  Most vendors provide HTTP or TCP/IP communication with their API.  They will process the credit card information on your behalf.  Two vendors are &lt;a href="http://www.authorize.net/"&gt;Authorize.Net&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_payflow-pro-overview-outside"&gt;PayFlow Pro&lt;/a&gt;.  The link I provide below has some more information on other vendors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what? For starters there are guidelines on what your application has to adhere to for transmitting the transactions.  During the process of getting everything setup, someone will look at your site or application and make sure you are adhering to the guidelines, like using SSL and that you have terms of use and policy documentation on what the information the user is giving you is used for.  Don't steal this from another site.  Come up with your own, hire a lawyer if you need to.  Most of these things fall under the PCI Data Security link Michael provided in his question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you plan on storing the credit card numbers, then you better be prepared to put some security measures in place internally to protect the info.  Make sure the server the information is stored on is only accessible to members who need to have access.  Like any good security, you do things in layers.  The more layers you put in place the better.  If you want you can use key fob type security, like &lt;a href="http://www.rsa.com/node.aspx?id=1156"&gt;SecureID&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.aladdin.com/etoken/default.aspx"&gt;eToken&lt;/a&gt; to protect the room the server is in.  If you can't afford the key fob route, then use the two key method.  Allow a person who has access to the room to sign out a key, which goes along with a key they already carry.  They will need both keys to access the room.  Next you protect the communication to the server with policies.  My policy is that the only thing communicating to it over the network is the application and that information is encrypted.  The server should not be accessible in any other form.  For backups, I use &lt;a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/"&gt;truecrypt&lt;/a&gt; to encrypt the volumes the backups will be saved to.  Anytime the data is removed or stored somewhere else, then again you use truecrypt to encrypt the volume the data is on.  Basically where ever the data is, it needs to be encrypted.  Make sure all processes for getting at the data carries auditing trails.  use logs for access to the server room, use cameras if you can, etc...  Another measure is to encrypt the credit card information in the database.  This makes sure that the data can only be viewed in your application where you can enforce who sees the information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href="http://www.pfsense.com/"&gt;pfsense&lt;/a&gt; for my firewall.  I run it off a compact flash card and have two servers setup.  One is for fail over for redundancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this &lt;a href="http://www.west-wind.com/presentations/aspnetecommerce/aspnetecommerce.asp"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; by Rick Strahl which helped tremendously to understand doing e-commerce and what it takes to accept credit cards through a web application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this turned out to be a long answer.  I hope these tips help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was recently working within the confines of a very limiting content management system.  I needed to include database code within the page, but the hosting server didn't have anything usable available.  I set up a couple barebones scripts on my own server, originally thinking that I could use AJAX to import the contents of my scripts directly into the template of the CMS (thus retaining dynamic images, menu items, CSS, etc.).  I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the limitations of XMLHttpRequest objects, it's not possible to grab content from a different domain.  So I thought "iFrame" - even though I'm not a fan of frames, I thought that I could create a frame that matched the width and height of the content, so that it would appear native.  Again, I was blocked by cross-site scripting "protections."  While I could indeed load a remote file into the iFrame, I couldn't execute JavaScript to modify its size on either the host page or inside the loaded page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this particular scenario, I wasn't able to point a subdomain to my server.  &lt;strong&gt;I also couldn't create a script on the CMS server that could proxy content from my server, so my last thought was to use a remote JavaScript.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A remote JavaScript works.  It breaks when the user has JavaScript disabled, which is a downside; but it works.  The "problem" I was having with using a remote JavaScript was that I had to use the JS function document.write() to output any content.  Any output that isn't JS causes script errors.  In addition to using document.write() for every line, you also have to ensure that the content is escaped - or else you end up with more script errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My solution was as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My script received a GET parameter ("page") and then looked for the file ({$page}.php), and read the contents into a variable.  However, I had to use awkward buffering techniques in order to actually execute the included scripts (for things like database interaction) then strip the final content of all line break characters ("\n") followed by escaping all required characters.  The end result is that my original script (which outputs JavaScript) accesses seemingly "standard" scripts on my server and converts their standard output to JavaScript for displaying within the CMS template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this solution works, it seems like there may be a better way to accomplish the same thing.  What is the best way to make cross-site scripting work specifically for the purpose of including content from a completely different domain?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoops, submitted before I was done.  The ASP.NET MVC site has tons of videos/screencast on getting started with ASP.NET MVC.  Definitely watch the Scott Hanselman ones first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Edit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rob Conery screencasts that &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/52668/aspnet-mvc-quick-start-a-one-stop-tutorial#52675" rel="nofollow"&gt;@David provided&lt;/a&gt; are provided on the &lt;a href="http://www.asp.net/learn/mvc-videos/" rel="nofollow"&gt;ASP.NET MVC site&lt;/a&gt; also, under videos.  That would constitute one spot to get those resources and also the ones the ASP.NET MVC team put out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One note on any resource you use.  You could run into functionality that is no longer available in the framework due to it being in development.  If you use the resources provided that you already found along with the tutorials, you will find the replacements or how to get around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all of this comes with added complexity. Instead of just saving the code, it has to be checked into the system. Every major version control system has tools to easily check code in, and many will integrate directly with IDEs. However, this doesn't change the fact that there are additional steps that must be taken when saving code files. There is overhead in placing code in a version control system, but having working code to roll back to when a problem occurs can make up for this extra overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

Basically the idea is to open the file as a stream and then to "write" the file stream to the reponse, specifying the content type and content disposition headers.  Content disposition is used to preserve the file name, content type of course to clue the browser about what app to open to view the file.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works all good and fine in a development environment and UAT environment.  However, in the production environment, things do not always work as expected,however only with IE6/IE7. FF works great in all environments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that in the production environment SSL is enabled and generally used.  (When SSL is not used in the production environment, file streams, is named as expected, and properly dislays.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a code snippet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;System.IO.FileStream fs = new System.IO.FileStream(Server.MapPath(".") + "\\" + "test.doc", System.IO.FileMode.Open);
long byteNum = fs.Length;
byte[] pdfBytes = new byte[byteNum];
fs.Read(pdfBytes, 0, (int)byteNum);

Response.AppendHeader("Content-disposition", "filename=Testme.doc");
Response.CacheControl = "no-cache";
Response.ContentType = "application/msword; charset=utf-8";
Response.Expires = -1;
Response.OutputStream.Write(pdfBytes, 0, pdfBytes.Length);
Response.Flush();
Response.Close();
fs.Close();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said, this code snippet works fine on the dev machine and in the UAT environment.  A dialog box opens and asks to save, view or cancel Testme.doc.  But in production onnly when using SSL, IE 6 &amp;amp; IE7 don't use the name of the attachment.  Instead it uses the name of the page that is sending the stream, testheader.apx and then an error is thrown.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IE does provide an advanced setting "Do not save encrypted pages to disk".  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect this is part of the problem, the server tells the browser not to cache the file, while IE has the "Do not save encrypted pages to disk" enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes I am aware that for larger files, the code snippet above will be a major drag on memory and this implimentation will be problematic. So the real final solution will not open the entire file into a single byte array, but rather will open the file as a stream, and then send the file down to the client in bite size chunks (e.g. perhaps roughly 10K in size).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone else have similar experience "streaming" binary files over ssl?  Any suggestions or recommendations?&lt;/p&gt;

}

&lt;p&gt;Things I have checked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Paths are full paths&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;While the code is paused on this line, I can actually drop to a shell and run the interactive php interpreter and get the correct result&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The paths are all WELL under 256 chars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can't imagine a permissions problem as the folder doesn't exist! The parent folder can't be causing permissions problems as the other folders in the loop are correctly reported as missing.&lt;/li&gt;

Your stack traces will contain line numbers and symbol names of the stack frames inside of the modules for which you have the pdb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll give two usages examples.  The first is the obvious answer.  The second explains source-indexed pdb's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1st usage example...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on calling convention and which optimizations the compiler used, it might not be possible for the debugger to manually unwind the stack through a module for which you do not have a pdb.  This can happen with certain third party libraries and even for some parts of the OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider a scenario in which you encounter an access violation inside of the windows OS.  The stack trace does not unwind into your own application because that OS component uses a special calling convention that confuses the debugger.  If you configure your symbol path to download the public OS pdb's, then there is a good chance that the stack trace will unwind into your application.  That enables you to see exactly what arguments your own code passed into the OS system call.  (and similar example for AV inside of a 3rd party library or even inside of your own code)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2nd usage example...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pdb's have another very useful property - they can integrate with some source control systems using a feature that microsoft calls "source indexing".  A source-indexed pdb contains source control commands that specify how to fetch from source control the exact file versions that were used to build the component.  Microsoft's debuggers understand how to execute the commands to automatically fetch the files during a debug session.  This is a powerful feature that saves the debug egineer from having to manually sync a source tree to the correct label for a given build.  It's especially useful for remote debugging sessions and for analyzing crash dumps post-mortem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "debugging tools for windows" installation (windbg) contains a document named srcsrv.doc which provides an example demonstrating how to use srctool.exe to determine which source files are source-indexed in a given pdb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer your question "how do I know", the "modules" feature in the debugger can tell you which modules have a corresponding pdb.  In windbg use the "lml" command.  In visual studio select modules from somewhere in the debug menus.  (sorry, I don't have a current version of visual studio handy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use whatever system works and you're comfortable with but if you do development then you need version control (ideally set up in such a way that the source is on at least two machines even before you worry about backups).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that - look for a system that lets you commit early and commit often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm almost - odd though it may sound - heading towards the view that every project, even a 1 dev one - should be looking at continuous integration i.e. having this system built and tested, from scratch, each time changes are committed or at least on a regular basis. Why? This a) gives you confidence that you have a buildable system in VCS and b) makes sure that you actually have a clean builds to test and deploy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If pooling is on then you need to profile all the ports of SQL Server and make sure you have enough and expand them if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

We did not see it in development because the load was 2 or 3 people at max, but once the number grew over 10 we kept seeing this error.  We turned pooling on, and it fixed it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Map has the important property that
  inserting a new element into a map
  does not invalidate iterators that

  element from a map also does not
  invalidate any iterators, except, of

&lt;p&gt;All in all, there simply is no cheap way of returning the next element after erasing. For sequences, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Rob is right. There's no need for the Map to return an iterator.&lt;/p&gt;

Chances are that you don't. In fact, if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; store them and manage to have one stolen, you could be looking at some serious liability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've written an app that does store credit card numbers (since the transactions were processed offline). Here's a good way to do it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get an SSL certificate!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a form to get CC# from the user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encrypt part (not all!) of the CC# and store it in your database. (I'd suggest the middle 8 digits.) Use a strong encryption method and a secret key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mail the remainder of the CC# to whoever processes your transactions (probably yourself) with the ID of the person to process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you log in later, you will type in the ID and the mailed-out portion of the CC#. Your system can decrypt the other portion and recombine to get the full number so you can process the transaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, delete the online record. My paranoid solution was to overwrite the record with random data before deletion, to remove the possibility of an undelete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds like a lot of work, but by never recording a complete CC# anywhere, you make it extremely hard for a hacker to find anything of value on your webserver. Trust me, it's worth the peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: The way I usually do it is to have the location stored in the app's settings.  On load, if there is no value for them, it defaults to the center of the screen.  On closing of the form, it records its position.  That way, whenever it opens, it's where it was last.  I don't know of a simple way to tell it to launch onto the second monitor the first time automatically, however.&lt;/p&gt;

If it can be coded in a clearer way, then that's fine, but sometimes you're really cool, really fast, optimisation is just too much for mere mortals, even with a comment block bigger than the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the code walkthrough comes in.  For most people always walking all of the code would be a waste of time, but walking through certain parts can be very beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My team has had some success with the following method:  first do a normal code review - for us this means one or more reviewers go through the new code or change sets and prepares his comments and questions.  Then we have a discussion, in person or via email, during which any reviewer can request a walkthrough, usually of a specific section of code or action.  If it's a proper review meeting with multiple reviewers then we'll usually finish that first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, we sit down in front of the same screen/projection, and fire up the program using gdb.  We trigger the code in question and actually go through the running code line by line, forcing error conditions if necessary.  Usually the reviewer is in control (at the keyboard), asking questions, checking variable values etc.  It can be time consuming, but on the tricky bits it's usually worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NB: Using VNC and the phone is almost as good too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only when the reviewer is happy with the code does he sign it off.  That might mean a walkthough, additional comments, adding more unit tests, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn't let you specify what monitor an app starts on, but it lets you move an app to the another monitor, and keep its aspect ratio intact, with one mouse click. It is a very handy utility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most programs will start where you last left them.

Most of these are fairly descriptive and help me find the problem very quickly (I use the MS Application Exception Block). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a few occasions I have reports that are issues that I can't reproduce, and seem to only happen on a few client machines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't have physical access to these client machines, what are some strategies I can use for debugging? Would it be better to build some tracing into the code, or are there some other alternatives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I should have been more clear: The error reports that I get do have the stack trace, but since it's production code, it doesn't indicate the exact line that caused the exception, just the method in which it was thrown.&lt;/p&gt;

I suspect that the answer is no as this is what I've experienced while using it.  However, it seems that at certain times it would be really useful when there are different features being worked on that may have different approval cycles (ie. feature one &lt;strong&gt;might&lt;/strong&gt; be approved before feature two).  This becomes exceedingly difficult when we have production branches where we have to merge some feature into a previous branch so we can release before the next full version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our current branching strategy is to develop in the trunk (or mainline as we call it), and create a branch to stabilize and release to production.  This branch can then be used to create hotfixes and other things while mainline can diverge for upcoming features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I wanted to post my thoughts (and possibly kick-start the thread again) because your post struck a chord with me.  I have an application almost exactly like yours, albeit it a bit smaller: PHP + SQL, ~5KLoC, first "real" app I wrote, first web app I wrote, etc., etc.  I was young and innocent, and after I handed off on it, I had something I was proud of (hey, I'd got it working!), and a relatively fat wad of cash in my back pocket.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months later, I got a couple of bug reports.  I went back to the project and found a horrible mess of PHP and SQL intertwined.  The admin part of the site was one ~2.5KLoC file, with duplication all over the place.  The database was possibly the best-designed bit, and that was only partially normalised.  It was truly ghastly, and very quickly I realised it was going to be a nightmare to maintain.  I fixed up the bugs and moved on.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple more bugs came in.  I fixed these up, and the sinking feeling got worse.  The last time some bugs came in, I mentioned re-writing it (I was still young and innocent and hadn't heard the Netscape story), that the code was effectively unmaintainable.  Luckily, it seems I'd ironed out the remaining major flaws; I haven't had any bugs in since (I'm still in touch with the client!).  I never did start re-writing that particular application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, to be honest, I'm glad of that.  Like most other projects I work on, this was a hobby/spare-time project.  I got paid for it, which put a bit more of a fire under my ass.  The original project was a kind of content management system, so as I learned more, I tried starting it again twice.  The second version (for a University orchestra) is still used, and was a vast improvement over the original one.  I used multiple files, functions, templates (of a sort)... Good times :-)  But still it was a bit rubbish.  The third version used object orientation and all the associated goodness, the Smarty templating system... Even better times :-D  This one never got finished.  The complexity of the system's requirements started to overwhelm me, and I eventually just stopped working on it.  I quickly found that there were a number of other content management systems around that would do what I wanted, one way or another, and I haven't turned away from &lt;a href="http://drupal.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; since taking that step two years ago!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When is it time to re-write an application?  Hardly ever; I agree that re-factoring is nearly always the way forward.  Even my monster original version could have been re-factored relatively easily and painlessly.  Only if you're wanting to do something radically different from before should you really consider it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BUT, there are also disadvantages. Since, you are no using WebForms you cannot use any ASP.NET control. It means if you want to create a GridView you will be running a for loop and create the table manually.

&lt;p&gt;I have been frustrated with WebForms for a really long time.  I'm definitely not alone here.  The smart-client, stateful abstraction over the web breaks down severely in complex scenarios.  I happen to love HTML, Javascript, and CSS.  WebForms tries to hide that from me.  It also has some really complex solutions to problems that are really not that complex.  Webforms is also inherently difficult to test, and while you can use MVP, it's not a great solution for a web environment...(compared to MVC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MVC will appeal to you if...
- you want more control over your HTML
- want a seamless ajax experience like every other platform has
- want testability through-and-through
- want meaningful URLs
- HATE dealing with postback &amp;amp; viewstate issues&lt;/p&gt;

(E.g. the &lt;code&gt;-n&lt;/code&gt; option of &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;bjam&lt;/code&gt; does this.)

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get the following normal response from the unit test DB indicating no row was deleted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;SQL0100W  No row was found for FETCH, UPDATE or DELETE; or the result of a query is an empty table.  SQLSTATE=02000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the development database fails to delete at all with the following error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;DB21034E  The command was processed as an SQL statement because it was not a valid Command Line Processor command.  During SQL processing it returned: SQL0440N  No authorized routine named "=" of type "FUNCTION" having compatible arguments was found.  SQLSTATE=42884&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My best guess is there is some trigger or view that was added or changed that is causing the problem, but I have no idea how to go about finding the problem... has anyone had this problem or know how to figure out what the root of the problem is?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(note that this is a DB2 database)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Internally, the ObjectDataSource is calling Type.GetType(string) to get the
  type, so we need to follow the guideline documented in Type.GetType on how
  to get type using generics. You can refer to MSDN Library on Type.GetType:&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/w3f99sx1.aspx"&gt;http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/w3f99sx1.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;From the document, you will learn that you need to use backtick (`) to
  denotes the type name which is using generics.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Also, here we must specify the assembly name in the type name string.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;So, for your question, the answer is to use type name like follows:&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;TypeName="TestObjectDataSourceAssembly.MyDataHandler`1[System.String],TestObjectDataSourceAssembly"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, makes sense. When I try it, however, the page throws an exception:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;asp:ObjectDataSource ID="MyDataSource" TypeName="MyProject.Repository`1[MyProject.MessageCategory],DataAccess" /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[InvalidOperationException: The type specified in the TypeName property of ObjectDataSource 'MyDataSource' could not be found.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The curious thing is that this only happens when I'm viewing the page. When I open the "Configure Data Source" dialog from the VS2008 designer, it properly shows me the methods on my generic Repository class. Passing the TypeName string to Type.GetType() while debugging also returns a valid type. So what gives?&lt;/p&gt;

Often you download a Silverlight or WPF sample application from the web and open it up in Blend, just to have Blend crash on you because the code doesn't run well inside the designer. If it doesn't crash, it seldom look anything like the running application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently gave a talk at Tech Ed Australia and New Zealand about techniques you can apply to "design for designability". A short bulled list is included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write code that can take advantage of data binding. The Model-View-ViewModel or the presentation pattern is a good fit for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supply "design time" stubs for your service dependencies. If the class you are binding against makes web service calls be sure to replace the web service client with a stub class that returns "dummy data" that the designer consumes inside blend. This can easily be done through IoC and Dependency Injection, injecting one implementation if HtmlPage.IsEnabled == false.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using data binding you can limit the number of "named elements" you have in your XAML file. If you write allot of code behind you end up coupling your C# code against named elements such as txtName or txtAddress, making it easy for the designer to "screw up".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use a command pattern instead of code behind click event handlers. By loosely couple the invoker of an event from the handler you can have less named elements, and you give the designer the freedom to choose between a Button or a Menu Item to invoke a specific command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Test your code in Blend! Even if you consider your self a pure developer you should test that your code is consumable by a tool, and strive to get a best possible experience at design time. Some would argue that a tool shouldn't effect your software design, just as some one complains about "design for testability", and making software design decisions just to make the code more testable. I think it's a smart thing to do, and the only way you can get some real designer-developer work flow going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other tips would be to start small. If your designer is new to XAML, WPF and Silverlight, start by introducing them to the project team, and have them do some basic designs in the tools they know. Let them do some buttons and illustrations in Adobe Illustrator, and export it to XAML, and show them how you can leverage their design assets directly. Continue by introducing more and more, and hopefully they get interested and want to make the switch to Blend. It's quite a learning curve, but it sure is worth it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then import the task:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;taskdef resource="emma_ant.properties" classpathref="emma.lib" /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then instrument the code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;target name="coverage.instrumentation"&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;mkdir dir="${instr.target}"/&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;mkdir dir="${coverage}"/&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;instr instrpath="${target}" destdir="${instr.target}" metadatafile="${coverage}/metadata.emma" mode="copy"&amp;gt;

 &amp;lt;/path&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/target&amp;gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then run a target with the proper VM arguments like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The CodeBase is a URL to the place where the file was found, while the Location is the path where it was actually loaded. For example, if the assembly was downloaded from the internet, its CodeBase may start with "http://", but its Location may start with "C:\". If the file was shadow-copied, the Location would be the path to the copy of the file in the shadow copy dir.
Its also good to know that the CodeBase is not guaranteed to be set for assemblies in the GAC. Location will always be set for assemblies loaded from disk, however.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;

This is an approach to API creation that newer libraries like NInject and Moq are using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, let's say that I want to register a method with an API and that API needs to get the method name&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class MyClass
{
     public void SomeMethod() { /* Do Something */ }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before, it was very common to see developers do this with strings and types (or something else largely string-based):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;RegisterMethod(typeof(MyClass), "SomeMethod");
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that sucks because of the lack of strong-typing. What if I rename "SomeMethod"? Now, in 3.5 however, I can do this in a strongly-typed fashion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;RegisterMethod&amp;lt;MyClass&amp;gt;(cl =&amp;gt; cl.SomeMethod());
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In which the RegisterMethod class uses &lt;code&gt;Expression&amp;lt;Action&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void RegisterMethod&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(Expression&amp;lt;Action&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt; action) where T : class
{
    var expression = (action.Body as MethodCallExpression);

    if (expression != null)
    {
        // TODO: Register method
        Console.WriteLine(expression.Method.Name);
    }
}

$username = 'user';

&lt;p&gt;The easiest, most pain-free way to do it is to use the &lt;a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fauxcolumns/"&gt;Faux Columns&lt;/a&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if that solution doesn't work for you, you'll want to read up on &lt;a href="http://www.positioniseverything.net/articles/onetruelayout/equalheight"&gt;this technique&lt;/a&gt;. But be warned, this is the kind of CSS hackery that will make you wake up in a cold sweat in the middle of the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gist of it is that you assign a large amount of padding to the bottom of the column, and a negative margin of the same size. Then you place your columns in a container that has &lt;code&gt;overflow: hidden&lt;/code&gt; set. More or less the padding/margin values allow the box to keep expanding until it reaches the end of the wrapper (which is determined by the column with the most content), and any extra space generated by the padding is cut off as overflow. It doesn't make much sense, I know...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div id="wrapper"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;div id="col1"&amp;gt;Content&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;div id="col2"&amp;gt;Longer Content&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

#wrapper {
  overflow: hidden;
}

#col1, #col2 {
  padding-bottom: 9999px;
  margin-bottom: -9999px;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure to read the entire article I linked to, there are a number of caveats and other implementation issues. It's not a pretty technique, but it works fairly well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whoever instantiated a given command object and the command object,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the command object and the "data access" object (i.e. someone who handles the remote procedure calls over the network to the servers) that the command object calls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these two callback routes has to be able to be a one-to-one relationship. This is due to the fact that I might have several instances of a given command class running the exact same job at the same time but with slightly different parameters, and I don't want their callbacks getting mixed up. Using events, the default way of handling asynchronicity in AS3, is thus pretty much out since they're inherently based on one-to-many relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I have done this using &lt;strong&gt;callback function references&lt;/strong&gt; with specific kinds of signatures, but I was wondering &lt;em&gt;if someone knew of a better (or an alternative) way?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's an example to illustrate my current method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I might have a view object that spawns a &lt;code&gt;DeleteObjectCommand&lt;/code&gt; instance due to some user action, passing references to two of its own private member functions (one for success, one for failure: let's say &lt;code&gt;"deleteObjectSuccessHandler()"&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;"deleteObjectFailureHandler()"&lt;/code&gt; in this example) as callback function references to the command class's constructor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then the command object would repeat this pattern with its connection to the "data access" object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the RPC over the network has successfully been completed (or has failed), the appropriate callback functions are called, first by the "data access" object and then the command object, so that finally the view object that instantiated the operation in the first place gets notified by having its &lt;code&gt;deleteObjectSuccessHandler()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;deleteObjectFailureHandler()&lt;/code&gt; called.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, you can place a bunch of files into a directory and add an __init__.py file to the directory.  If the directory is in your PYTHONPATH or sys.path, you can do "import directoryname" to import everything in the directory or "import directoryname.some_file_in_directory" to import a specific file that is in the directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent directories with a common name, such as "string", from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later on the module search path. In the simplest case, __init__.py can just be an empty file, but it can also execute initialization code for the package or set the __all__ variable, described later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real underlying issue is that structs are a Value type, not a Reference type. So when you pull out a "reference" to the struct from the list, it is creating a new copy of the entire struct. So any changes you make on it are changing the copy, not the original version in the list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Andrew states, you have to replace the entire struct. As that point though I think you have to ask yourself why you are using a struct in the first place (instead of a class). Make sure you aren't doing it around premature optimization concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for a typical line in the sln file (open the .sln in notepad or editor-of-choice if you wish to see this):&lt;/p&gt;

The most important (as your second post points out) is correctness, and to achieve that all you need is to return the Length of the array. Depending on your dataset that might even be ok. If it isn't (say all your arrays are equally long) you can go with something cheap like looking at the first and last value and XORing their values and then add more complexity as you see fit for your data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick way to see how your hashfunction performs on your data is to add all the data to a hashtable and count the number of times the Equals function gets called, if it is too often you have more work to do on the function. If you do this just keep in mind that the hashtable's size needs to be set bigger than your dataset when you start, otherwise you are going to rehash the data which will trigger reinserts and more Equals evaluations (though possibly more realistic?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some objects (not this one) a quick HashCode can be generated by ToString().GetHashCode(), certainly not optimal, but useful as people tend to return something close to the identity of the object from ToString() and that is exactly what GetHashcode is looking for&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trivia: The worst performance I have ever seen was when someone by mistake returned a constant from GetHashCode, easy to spot with a debugger though, especially if you do lots of lookups in your hashtable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SMS Aggregators&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For larger volume and good reliability, you will want to go with an SMS aggregator.  These aggregators have web service API's (or SMPP) that you can use to send your message and find out whether your message was delivered over time.  Some examples of aggregators with whom I have experience are Air2Web, mBlox, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about working with an aggregator is that they can guide you through what it takes to send effective messages.  For example, if you want your own, distinct, shortcode they can navigate the process with the carriers to secure that shortcode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also make sure that you are in compliance with any rules regarding using SMS.  Carriers will flat shut you off if you don't respect the use of SMS and only use SMS within the bounds of what you agreed to when you started to use the aggregator.  If you overstep your bounds, they have the aggregator relationships to prevent any service interruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll pay per message and may have a baseline service fee.  All if this is determined by your volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SMTP to SMS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want an unreliable, low-rent solution to a low number of known addresses, you can use an SMTP to SMS solution.  In this case you simply find out the mobile provider for the recipient and use their mobile provider's e-mail scheme to send the message.  An example of this is 7705551212@cellcompany.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, you send the message and it is gone and you hope that it gets there.  You really don't know if it is making it.  Also, some providers limit how messages come in via their SMTP to SMS gateway to limit SMS spam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, that scenario is the very easiest to use from virtually any programming language.  There are a million C# examples of how to send e-mail and this way would be no different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the most cost-effective solution (i.e. free) until you get a large volume of messages.  When you start doing too much of this, the carriers might step in when they find that you are sending a ton of messages through their SMTP to SMS gateway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Effective Texting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cases you have to make sure that recipients have properly opted-in to your service.  This is only a big deal if your texts are going to a really large population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll want to remember that text messages are short (keep it to less than 140 to 160 characters).  When you program things you'll want to bake that in or you might accidentally send multipart messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't forget that you will want to make sure that your recipients realize they might have to pay for the incoming text messages.  In a world of unlimited text plans this is less and less of a concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It depends on how unique your data access and object design needs are.  It may also depend on how you plan on supporting your application in the long term.  Finally, it greatly depends on the skill level of your developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn't a one-size-fits-all answer to this question, but generally, if your main focus is on cranking out software that provides some business value, pick out an existing framework and run with it.  Don't spend your cycles building something that won't immediately drive business profits (i.e. increases revenues and/or decreases costs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, one of my organization's projects is core to the operations of the company, needs to be developed and deployed as soon as possible, and will have a long life.  For these reasons, we picked CSLA with some help from Enterprise Library.  We could have picked other frameworks, but the important thing is that we picked a framework that seemed like it would fit well with our application and our developer skillset and we ran with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gave us a good headstart and a community from which we can get support.  We immediately started with functionality that provided business value and were not banging our heads against the wall trying to build a framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also in the position where we can hire people in the future who have most likely had exposure to our framework, giving them a really good headstart.  This should reduce long-term support costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there things we don't use and overhead that we may not need?  Perhaps.  But, I'll trade that all day long for delivering business value in code early and often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extract Method&lt;/strong&gt; If your methods are getting so long that your variable declarations have scrolled off the top of the screen, consider making your methods smaller.  (If you have too many methods, consider a new class.)  &lt;/p&gt;

Then your bug will be caught at compile time, instead of requiring careful inspection by a human.  When I do this, I usually find a bunch of zip code- and shoe size-specific logic that I've peppered around my code, which I can then move in to my new classes.  Suddenly all my code gets clearer, simpler, and protected from certain classes of bugs.  Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

The index tuning wizard in MSSQL takes most of the guess work on what indexes are missing or misplaced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One shortcoming of MySQL is there's no max size for a database. The database would just increase in size till it fills up the disk. Imagine if this disk is sharing databases with other users and suddenly all of their queries are failing because their databases can't grow. I have reported this issue to MySQL long time ago.
