In particular I was looking at H2, HSQLDB and Derby.
Have you use any of these in a production project?
Do you have comment or recommendations to select one over the others?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; I am currently evaluating these options to use in our internal developments, so I don't have a specific use case in mind. One of the possible uses I am evaluating them for is a desktop application that uses the database as a local repository. At some point it synchronizes with a central repository (in this case DB2). It is a store and forward architecture. Anyway, this is just a possibility to guide your answers, Basically Im looking for your experiences using these tools.&lt;/p&gt;

I'd like to use Ruby on Rails for the webapp, but I'm concerned with the BLOB support. In my experience with other languages, frameworks, and databases, BLOBs are often overlooked and thus have poor, difficult, and/or buggy functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does RoR spport BLOBs adequately? Are there any gotchas that creep up once you're already committed to Rails?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW: I want to be using PostgreSQL and/or MySQL as the backend database. Obviously, BLOB support in the underlying database is important. For the moment, I want to avoid focusing on the DB's BLOB capabilities; I'm more interested in how Rails itself reacts. Ideally, Rails should be hiding the details of the database from me, and so I should be able to switch from one to the other. If this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the case (ie: there's some problem with using Rails with a particular DB) then please do mention it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Also, I'm not just talking about ActiveRecord here. I'll need to handle binary files on the HTTP side (file upload effectively). That means getting access to the appropriate HTTP headers and streams via Rails. I've updated the question title and description to reflect this.&lt;/p&gt;

Many developers still write code on those terminal windows without a debugger to add enhancements to their Mainframe systems, which I call the stone age of programming. (No offense to the Mainframe developers.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question&lt;/strong&gt;: Are there any Technical Advantages on these legacy systems compared to the modern systems built on .Net, J2EE or other modern platforms?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only reason for keeping these systems, I think, is these big banks and retailers are locked-in by these legacy systems, which have been developed and enhanced for more than 20 years.  No one can afford the money / risks to port them to a modern platform.  Please share your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about building all the tables first and then building all the constraints, is that the tables can be created in any order.  When I've done this I had one file per table, which I put in a directory called "Tables" and then a script which executed all the files in that directory.  Likewise I had a folder for constraint scripts (which did foreign key and indexes too), which were executed when after the tables were built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would separate the build of the triggers and stored procedures, and run these last.  The point about these is they can be run and re-run on the database without affecting the data.  This means you can treat them just like ordinary code.  You should include "if exists...drop" statements at the beginning of each trigger and procedure script, to make them re-runnable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the order would be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;table creation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add indexes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add constraints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add triggers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add stored procedures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my current project we are using MSBuild to run the scripts.  There are some &lt;a href="http://www.codeplex.com/sdctasks" rel="nofollow"&gt;extension targets&lt;/a&gt; that you can get for it which allow you to call sql scripts.  In the past I have used perl which was fine too (and batch files...which I would not recommend - the're too limited).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing the function to determine the real OS version is simple; just proceed from newest OS to oldest and use &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms683212.aspx"&gt;GetProcAddress&lt;/a&gt; to check exported APIs.

&lt;p&gt;--- updated 2009-10-09&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that it gets very hard to do an "undocumented" OS detection on Vista SP1 and higher. A look at the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa383687%28VS.85%29.aspx"&gt;API changes&lt;/a&gt; shows that all Windows 2008 functions are also implemented in Vista SP1 and that all Windows 7 functions are also implemented in Windows 2008 R2. Too bad :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--- end of update&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FWIW, this is a problem I encountered in practice. We (the company I work for) have a program that was not really Vista-ready when Vista was released (and some weeks after that ...). It was not working under the compatibility layer either. (Some DirectX problems. Don't ask.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn't want too-smart-for-their-own-good users to run this app on Vista at all - compatibility mode or not - so I had to find a solution (a guy smarter than me pointed me into right direction; the stuff above is not my brainchild). Now I'm posting it for your pleasure and to help all poor souls that will have to solve this problem in the future. Google, please index this article!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a better solution (or an upgrade and/or fix for mine), please post an answer here ...&lt;/p&gt;

It seems to me like it would give you more options on how the methods are called, allowing you to use it in a fluent-interface-like style and I can't really think of any disadvantages since you don't have to do anything with the return value (even store it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So suppose you're in a situation where you want to update an object and then return its current value.
instead of saying &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;myObj.Update();
var val = myObj.GetCurrentValue();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you will be able to combine the two lines to say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var val = myObj.Update().GetCurrentValue();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt;  I asked the below on a whim, in retrospect, I agree that its likely to be unnecessary and complicating, however my question regarding returning this rather than void stands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a related note, what do you guys think of having the language include a new bit of syntactic sugar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var val = myObj.Update()&amp;lt;.GetCurrentValue();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This operator would have a low order of precedence so myObj.Update() would execute first and then call  GetCurrentValue() on myObj instead of the void return of Update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially I'm imagining an operator that will say "call the method on the right-hand side of the operator on the first valid object on the left".  Any thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are one-to-one relationships: No Alpha will relate to more than one Bravo.  And no Bravo will relate to more than one Alpha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've got a few goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a system that's easy to learn and
maintain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;data integrity enforced within my
database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a schema that matches the
real-world, logical organization of
my data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;classes/objects within my
programming that map well to
database tables ( la Linq to SQL)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;speedy read and write operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;effective use of space (few null fields)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've got three ideas&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;PK = primary key  
FK = foreign key  
NU = nullable
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One table with many nullalbe fields (flat file)&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;      Alphas
      --------
   PK AlphaId
      AlphaOne
      AlphaTwo
      AlphaThree
   NU BravoOne
   NU BravoTwo
   NU BravoThree
   NU CharlieOne
   NU CharlieTwo
   NU CharlieThree
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many tables with zero nullalbe fields&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;      Alphas
      --------
   PK AlphaId
      AlphaOne
      AlphaTwo
      AlphaThree

      Bravos
      --------
FK PK AlphaId
      BravoOne
      BravoTwo
      BravoThree

      Charlies
      --------
FK PK AlphaId
      CharlieOne
      CharlieTwo
      CharlieThree
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best (or worst) of both: Lots of nullalbe foreign keys to many tables&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;      Alphas
      --------
   PK AlphaId
      AlphaOne
      AlphaTwo
      AlphaThree
NU FK BravoId
NU FK CharlieId

      Bravos
      --------
   PK BravoId
      BravoOne
      BravoTwo
      BravoThree

      Charlies
      --------
   PK CharlieId
      CharlieOne
      CharlieTwo
      CharlieThree
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if an Alpha must be either Bravo or Charlie, but not both?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if instead of just Bravos and Charlies, Alphas could also be any of Deltas, Echos, Foxtrots, or Golfs, etc&amp;hellip;?&lt;/p&gt;

Supporting multiple collection types seems a bit wrong to me. You may also want to look at casting yout IList to IEnumerable for serialization since IList just wraps IEnumerable and ICollection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about a sliding window...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;REMOVE LENGTH 2: (no other length has other matches)
//the lower case letters are the matches
ABCBAbabaBBCbcbcbVbvBCbcbcAB  
__ABCBABABABBCBCBCBVBVBCBCBCAB

REMOVE LENGTH 1 (duplicate characters):
//* denote that a string was removed to prevent continual contraction
//of the string, unless this is what you want.
ABCBA*BbC*V*BC*AB
_ABCBA*BBC*V*BC*AB

RESULT:
ABCBA*B*C*V*BC*AB == ABCBABCVBCAB
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is of course starting with length=2, increase it to L/2 and iterate down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm also thinking of two other approaches:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;digraph&lt;/strong&gt; - Set a stateful digraph with the data and iterate over it with the string, if a cycle is found you'll have a duplication. I'm not sure how easy it is check check for these cycles... possibly some dynamic programming, so it could be equivlent to method 2 below. I'm going to have to think about this one as well longer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;distance matrix&lt;/strong&gt; - using a levenstein distance matrix you might be able to detect duplication from diagonal movement (off the diagonal) with cost 0. This could indicate duplication of data. I will have to think about this more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

We are having a problem that may be specific to WebMethods, but if anyone can point me in a direction of what kinds of things might cause this I'd appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When polling two of our partners' FTP servers, we connect without issue but, when doing a NLST on a directory that is empty (no files and no subdirectories) it's timing out.  The actual error is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's being thrown during the invocation of the pub.client.ftp:ls service.  I've logged in with a number of FTP clients without a problem to the same sites.  I've used whatever the default FTP client is in windows, FileZilla and lftp.  All without issue.  The servers themselves aren't the same FTP server software from what I can tell.  One is Microsoft FTP, the other I'm uncertain on but is definitely not Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any idea what could cause an FTP client to timeout when waiting for a NLST response on an empty directory?  The visible responses from the FTP server appear to be the same, but is there a difference in how NLST responds for an empty directory that I'm unaware of?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This problem is consistent on these two servers.  Everything functions fine on directories with files or subdirectories within it, but not when empty.&lt;/p&gt;

FK PK AlphaId

      --------
   PK AlphaId
   PK AlphaType NOT NULL IN ("Bravo", "Charlie")
      AlphaOne
      AlphaTwo
      AlphaThree

      Bravos
      --------
FK PK AlphaId
FK PK AlphaType == "Bravo"
      BravoOne
      BravoTwo
      BravoThree

      Charlies

FK PK AlphaId
FK PK AlphaType == "Charlie"
      CharlieOne
      CharlieTwo
      CharlieThree

Let's say you have some collection object with a remove() method that would normally return void.  Now you want to return a reference to the collection itself.  The new signature would look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public MyCollection remove(Object someElement)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just looking at the signature, it's not clear that you're returning a reference to the same instance.  Maybe MyCollection is immutable and you're returning a new instance.  In some cases, like here, you would need some external documentation to clarify this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually like this idea, and I believe that there was some talk in retrofitting all void methods in Java7 to return a reference to 'this', but it ultimately fell through. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a table for people who sent in resumes, and it has their email address in it...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to find out if any of these people have NOT signed up on the web site. The aspnet_Membership table has all the people who ARE signed up on the web site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 9472 job seekers, with unique email addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This query produces 1793 results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;select j.email from jobseeker j
join aspnet_Membership m on j.email = m.email
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggests that there should be 7679 (9472-1793) emails of people who are not signed up on the web site. Since 1793 of them DID match, I would expect the rest of them DON'T match... but when I do the query for that, I get nothing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this query giving me nothing???&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;select j.email 
from jobseeker j

Most blame the speed at which the ReadDirectoryChangesW function loop is called.  This is an incorrect assumption.

&lt;p&gt;The summary is that the ReadDirectoryChangesW function reports file changes as they leave the file-write-behind queue, not as they are added.  And if too many are added before being committed, you lose notice on some of them.  You can see this with your implementation, if you just write a program to generate a 1000+ files in a directory real quick.  Just count how many file event notices you get and you will see there are times when you will not receive all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is, has anyone found a reliable method to use the ReadDirectoryChangesW function without having to flush the volume each time?  This is not allowed if the user is not an Administrator and can also take some time to complete.&lt;/p&gt;

This may be a small up-front burden on users, but the app has a much longer life between upgrades. That may or may not be important to you, but consider: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you had shipped an application in 2005 using .NET 1.1, the framework your app runs on is now out of mainstream support, and may have unpatched security vulnerabilities, or other serious problems which Microsoft may not deal with, and which you cannot compensate for in your own code. Your only alternative in 2008 is to get your users to upgrade their framework version now. And, as we all know, getting users to update things in a timely fashion can be problematic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, consider your situation in 2011. If you program for .NET 3.5 now, your app, as-shipped, will be viable longer. If you ship for .NET 2.0 now, you'll be in the position, in a few years' time, of having to convince your users to upgrade their framework (code which has no perceived benefit to them, remember) so that you can properly support this application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you plan to implement 3.5-class features (LINQ to SQL next year, for example), it's in your interest to ship for 3.5 now, rather than 2.0, as it will make deployment later less of a problem for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;You may want to run your application against a newer framework version sometime in the future and if your client already has that version and is running the current version of the application, there won't be an old framework on their computer.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For statuses, e.g. daily builds, regression test results, etc., you might like to consider making a dashboard page that reports everything of interest in a RAG (red, amber, green) status at the top level. Then you can click-though to drill down to more detail if required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I implemented this for a major project and had RAG status for continuous builds and regression tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clicking on the RAG indicators brought up more detail. This was repeated for several levels so at the top level you had the RAG indicator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, clicking on the indicator for the regular build took you down to see what had broken the build, clicking again took you further to see who had broken the build, clicking again brought you down to the actual error message from the compiler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) Reset the password for the user and hope another SMTP mail is sent with the auto-generated password.
b) Delete and recreate the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could rollback the user creation if the smtp is not sent but what is the best practice to tackle this problem?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking that I should retry sending the email 3 times with a timeout period of 5 seconds each. So 15 seconds would be the worse case scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this the way to go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.NET 3.5 SP1 introduces a new setup package option for developers building .NET client applications called the ".NET Framework Client Profile".  This provides a new setup installer that enables a smaller, faster, and simpler installation experience for .NET client applications on machines that do not already have the .NET Framework installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The .NET Framework Client Profile setup contains just those assemblies and files in the .NET Framework that are typically used for client application scenarios.  For example: it includes Windows Forms, WPF, and WCF.  It does not include ASP.NET and those libraries and components used primarily for server scenarios.  We expect this setup package to be about 26MB in size, and it can be downloaded and installed much quicker than the full .NET Framework setup package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assemblies and APIs in the .NET Framework Client setup package are 100% identical to those in the full .NET Framework setup package (they are literally the same binaries).  This means that applications can target both the client profile and full profile of .NET 3.5 SP1 (no recompilation required).  All .NET applications that work using the .NET Client Profile setup automatically work with the full .NET Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

That of course likely involves keeping track of lastmodified and filenames.   &lt;s&gt;What this doesn't mean is that you need to poll when looking for changes, rather, you can use the FileSystemWatcher as a means to trigger checking.  &lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you keep track of the last 50-100 times the ReadDirectoryChangesW&lt;s&gt;/FSW&lt;/s&gt; event happened, and you see that it is being called rapidly, you can detect this and trigger the special condition to get all the files that have been changed (and set a flag to prevent future bogus FSW events temporarily) in a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since some people are confused in the comments about this solution, I am proposing that you should monitor how fast events are arriving from the ReadDirectoryChangesW and when they are arriving too fast, try to attempt a workaround (usually a manual sweep of a directory).  &lt;/p&gt;

As Rik said, it's &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; an intractable problem, but I don't think any formal analysis on the NP-completeness of the problem space has been done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, your best bet is to leverage your DBMS as much as possible. All DBMS systems translate SQL into some sort of query plan. You can use this query plan, which is an abstracted version of the query, as a good starting point (the DBMS will do LOTS of optimization, flattening queries into more workable models). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE: modern DBMS use a "cost-based" analyzer which is non-deterministic across statistics updates, so the query planner, over time, may change the query plan for identical queries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Oracle (depending on your version), you can tell the optimizer to switch from the cost based analyzer to the deterministic rule based analyzer (this will simplify plan analysis) with a SQL hint, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT /*+RULE*/ FROM yourtable
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rule-based optimizer has been deprecated since 8i but it still hangs around even thru 10g (I don't know 'bout 11). However, the rule-based analyzer is much less sophisticated: the error rate potentially is much higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For further reading of a more generic nature, IBM has been fairly prolific with their query-optimization patents. This one here on a method for converting SQL to an "abstract plan" is a good starting point:

Don't always do what others (like me) are saying. You will hear "prefer interfaces to abstract classes" but it really depends. It depends what the class is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above mentioned case where we have a hierarchy of objects, interface is a good idea. Interface helps to work with collections of these objects and it also helps when implementing a service working with any object of the hierarchy. You just define a contract for working with objects from the hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand when you implement a bunch of services that share a common functionality you can either separate the common functionality into a complete separate class or you can move it up into a common base class and make it abstract so that nobody can instantiate the base class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also consider this how to support your abstractions over time. Interfaces are fixed: You release an interface as a contract for a set of functionality that any type can implement. Base classes can be extended over time. Those extensions become part of every derived class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to the more general, how does FogBugz fit with the Agile methodology, your best bet is to do sprints as mini-releases.  Create a sprint and add the cases you want to achieve for that sprint to that release (or milestone).  Give it an end date, say a week away, if you do week long sprints.  Then EBS can track it and tell you if you are on schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graphs in the Reports section will also show you a burndown chart.  The terminology is a bit different because FogBugz isn't Agile-only but the info is there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to see if the expected time you are going to finish your sprint is staying steady or going forward.  If it is steady you are on track and your burndown rate is on target.  If it is creeping up, you are losing ground and your sprint is getting delayed.  Time to move things to the next sprint or figure out why you messed up your estimates :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially I suppose this is a burn-up chart instead of a burndown chart, but it gives you the same answer to the same question.  Am I going to finish on time?  What do I have left to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atalasoft's &lt;a href="http://www.atalasoft.com/cs/blogs/loufranco/archive/2006/10/25/11035.aspx"&gt;Lou Franco wrote an excellent post&lt;/a&gt; on this as well.  &lt;a href="http://paltman.com/2006/09/05/sprint-burndown-from-fogbugz/"&gt;Patrick Altman&lt;/a&gt; also has an article.&lt;/p&gt;

Your program can just queue the mail and move on, not worry about dealing with timeouts and graylists etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the message still can't be delivered, you could always try resending it (via a password reset feature).  If that fails as well, most likely there was a mistake in the email address, and I would suggest deleting the account, causing the user to re-register.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, of course, might not be possible on some systems, depending what can be done with an unconfirmed user - that really depends on what you allow people to do before their email is validated.&lt;/p&gt;

Use interfaces but use member objects for base implementation.  That way, you can define a factory that constructs your objects to behave in a certain way.  If you want to change the behavior then you make a new factory method (or abstract factory) that creates different types of sub-objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, you may find that your primary objects don't need interfaces at all, if all of the mutable behavior is defined in helper objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead of IPet or PetBase, you might end up with a Pet which has an IFurBehavior parameter.  The IFurBehavior parameter is set by the CreateDog() method of the PetFactory.  It is this parameter which is called for the shed() method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do this you'll find your code is much more flexible and most of your simple objects deal with very basic system-wide behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

[Your web app is a MUA (Mail User Agent) talking to the user's MTA (Mail Transfer Agent).]
Nothing says that the user's MTA must be reachable or working at the moment.  You need to run your own MTA so you ensure that somebody is providing queueing, retries, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you really want to bend over backwards, you could do what you're doing (only one attempt though), fallback to queueing the message and continuing to retry on a slower schedule for at least 24 hours, and expose that unfinished state to the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official answer on how your app is supposed to behave can be found in &lt;a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1123.txt" rel="nofollow"&gt;RFC1123 (Requirements for Internet Hosts - Application and Support)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;5.3.1.1 Sending Strategy&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The general model of a sender-SMTP is
  one or more processes that
  periodically attempt to transmit
  outgoing mail.  In a typical system,
  the program that composes a message
  has some method for requesting
  immediate attention for a new piece of
  outgoing mail, while mail that cannot
  be transmitted immediately MUST be
  queued and periodically retried by the
  sender.  A mail queue entry will
  include not only the message itself
  but also the envelope information.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The sender MUST delay retrying a
  particular destination after one
  attempt has failed.  In general, the
  retry interval SHOULD be at least 30
  minutes; however, more sophisticated
  and variable strategies will be
  beneficial when the sender-SMTP can
  determine the reason for non-
  delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Retries continue until the message is
  transmitted or the sender gives up;
  the give-up time generally needs to be
  at least 4-5 days.  The parameters to
  the retry algorithm MUST be
  configurable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;WidgetHolder(Widget a, Widget b, Widget c, Widget d): A(a), B(b), C(c), D(d){}

Simplifying the relationship between your application and the database reduces the number of places where you can have errors; errors in code that interfaces business logic to the database tend to be security problems. So, your DBA isn't wrong about locking things down to stored procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another benefit to locking the application down to stored procedures is that the app stack's database connection can have its privileges locked down to specific stored procedure calls and nothing else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A benefit to having a DBA involved in security logic for your application is that the different app features and roles can be partitioned in the database down to views, so that even if dynamic SQL and generic select statements are needed, the damage from an SQL vulnerability can be constrained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flip side of this is, of course, lost flexibility. An ORM is obviously going to be faster to develop to than a constant negotiation with a DBA over stored procedure parameters. And, as the pressure on those stored procedures grows, it's more and more likely that the procedures themselves will resort to dynamic SQL, which will be just as vulnerable as app composed SQL to attack. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a happy middle ground here, and you should try to find it. I've worked on projects recently that were saved from pretty terrible SQL injection problems because a DBA had carefully configured the database, its connections, and its stored procedures for "least privilege", so that any one database user had access only to what they needed to know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, as you write SQL code in your app logic, be sure that you're consistently using parameterized prepared statements, that you're sanitizing your input, that you're mindful of internationalized input (there are many, many ways to say single-quote over HTTP), and that you're mindful of how your database behaves when inputs are too large for column widths.&lt;/p&gt;

It has its own retry logic, and by default, it could take a long time for the message to be delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How are you detecting that the mail was not delivered?  What's the "timeout" coming from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should have a background process that handles the sending of mail.  If delivery to the MTA succeeds, you should assume all is well.  Unless you are blacklisted for SPAM, most MTAs will keep retrying until they get through.  If you actually get an error dropping the message off with you MTA, then definitely retry it, or figure out what's causing the failure and fix the bug.  Honestly, this part should never fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might want to monitor the return address for NDR messages so you can take some sort of action when you know for sure when the email wasn't delivered.  But if the user cannot yet log in to the system, there's no good way to let them know what happened.  Maybe you could set a cookie with a value that you associate with the email, and put something up on the login/registration page if you were unable to deliver the mail.&lt;/p&gt;

They have the really cool feature of being able to usurp an execution plan and remap it to the indexed view w/out having to change existing code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IE. Let's say I had a SPROC that was a really expensive join.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;SELECT [SOME COLUMNS]&lt;br /&gt;
  FROM Table1 INNER JOIN Table2 [DETAILS]&lt;br /&gt;
  INNER JOIN Table3 [BUNCH MORE JOINS]
  ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I authored an indexed view that held a similar result set then the Query Optimizer will very likely send the SPROC to my indexed view as opposed to the base tables and I get a big performance increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now say I wanted to use indexed views in an &lt;strong&gt;OLTP!?&lt;/strong&gt; I mean most OLTPs (like this site) are relatively read heavy, if they have expensive joins then we could speed them up a ton AND potentially reduce locking contention (&lt;a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001166.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001166.html&lt;/a&gt;). Even better is you wouldn't have to change any code, just author the indexed view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this also means the database gets bigger since we need to keep a copy of these data in the indexed view...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has anyone ever used indexed views to solve contention or speed issues in an OLTP? How come I've never seen this in use?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But if you used the character set directly with a strong random number generator, you'd have 88^9 possible passwords, 3.16e+17 combinations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, the likely attack against this system is going to be against the random number generator, so make sure you're using a cryptographically strong one. If you use PHP's standard rand function, it will be attacked by registering and resetting thousands of passwords to sample the RNG state and then predict the remaining RNG state, which will reduce the number of possible passwords an attacker needs to test. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My problem is that &lt;code&gt;CreateInstance&lt;/code&gt; fails with a "No parameterless constructor defined for this object" error unless I pass "true" on the non-public parameter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Fails
Activator.CreateInstance(type);

// Works
Activator.CreateInstance(type, true);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make the factory generic to make it a little simpler, like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class GenericFactory&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; where T : MyAbstractType
{
    public static T GetInstance()
    {
        return Activator.CreateInstance&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;();
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I was unable to find how to pass that "true" parameter for it to accept non-public constructors (internal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I miss something or it isn't possible?&lt;/p&gt;

There are two FTP modes, Active and Passive. The default &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ftp" rel="nofollow"&gt;FTP&lt;/a&gt; mode is active.

&lt;p&gt;In VS2003, everything had a Project file and a Solution file. If you had a Solution with one Project, you could open the Solution and see the one Project. If you opened the Project, it would try and create a new Solution file to contain the Project. But web projects and Winform projects all had Projects and Solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In VS2005 this changed a bit - by default now, Web projects no longer had Project files. They had received feedback from some web developers that didn't like Project files - their take was that if a file is in the directory, it's part of the app. After VS2005 shipped, they got more feedback from developers who did like the Project file notion, so they patched it back in. This is "Web Site" versus "Web Application" in VS2005 (and I can't remember which is which now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, in VS2005, if you have a Solution open with only one Project, you won't see in the Solution Explorer that there's even a Solution at all, you'll only see the Project (as if it was not in a Solution). Only after adding the second Project will you see that there's a Solution containing them both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically you were on the right track - Solutions and Projects work the same in Visual Studio as they did in Eclipse, it's just some quirks that make things confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

Changing a class from one parent to another will often result in a great deal of work, but Interfaces can often be removed and changed without a great deal of effect on the implementation class.  This is especially useful in cases where you have several narrow sets of behaviour that you "may" want a class to implement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works especially well in my field: game programming.  Base classes can get bloated with tons of behaviours that "may" be needed by inherited objects.  With interfaces different behaviours can be added or removed to objects easily and readily.  For example, if I create an interface for "IDamageEffects" for objects that I want to reflect damage, then I can easily apply that to various game objects, and easily change my mind later.  Say I design an initial class that I want to use for "static" decorative objects and I initially decide they are non-destructible.  Later on, I may decide it would be more fun if they could blow up so I alter the class to implement the "IDamageEffects" interface.  This is much easier to do than switching base classes or creating a new object hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what are the differences?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary from answers and links below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A pointer can be re-assigned any number of times while a reference can not be re-seated after binding. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pointers can point nowhere (&lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;), whereas reference always refer to an object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can't take the address of a reference like you can with pointers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's no "reference arithmetics" (but you can take the address of an object pointed by a reference and do pointer arithmetics on it as in &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;obj + 5&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clarify a misconception:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The C++ standard is very careful to avoid dictating how a compiler must
  implement references, but every C++ compiler implements
  references as pointers. That is, a declaration such as:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int &amp;amp;ri = i;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;if it's not optimized away entirely&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;allocates the same amount of storage
  as a pointer, and places the address
  of i into that storage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;So, a pointer and a reference both occupy the same amount of memory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a general rule, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use references in function parameters and return types to define useful and self-documenting interfaces. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use pointers to implement algorithms and data structures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

First, you can get a good idea of what to expect by making a copy of your project (or a portion of it) and give it a "dry run" through the .NET 2.0 compiler.  My experience with this was that the 2.0 compiler gives more warnings about bad programming practices that the 1.1 compiler let slide.  The compiler will warn you about implicit casts, "ambiguous" return paths (a code path where a function doesn't return a value), and some other minor things.&lt;/p&gt;

But that's not really true. The most important thing TCP gives you is congestion control: you can run 100 TCP connections across a DSL link all going at max speed, and all 100 connections will be productive, because they all "sense" the available bandwidth. Try that with 100 different UDP applications, all pushing packets as fast as they can go, and see how well things work out for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a larger scale, this TCP behavior is what keeps the Internet from locking up into "congestion collapse". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things that tend to push applications towards UDP:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group delivery semantics: it's possible to do reliable delivery to a group of people much more efficiently than TCP's point-to-point acknowledgement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out-of-order delivery: in lots of applications, as long as you get all the data, you don't care what order it arrives in; you can reduce app-level latency by accepting an out-of-order block. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfriendliness: on a LAN party, you may not care if your web browser functions nicely as long as you're blitting updates to the network as fast as you possibly can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even if you care about performance, you probably don't want to go with UDP:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You're on the hook for reliability now, and a lot of the things you might do to implement reliability can end up being slower than what TCP already does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you're network-unfriendly, which can cause problems in shared environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, firewalls will block you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can potentially overcome some TCP performance and latency issues by "trunking" multiple TCP connections together; iSCSI does this to get around congestion control on local area networks, but you can also do it to create a low-latency "urgent" message channel (TCP's "URGENT" behavior is totally broken).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pointer can be re-assigned: &lt;/p&gt;

int *p;
p =  &amp;amp;x;
p = &amp;amp;y;
*p = 10;
assert(x == 5);

&lt;p&gt;A reference cannot, and must be assigned at initialization:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int x = 5;
int y = 6;
int &amp;amp;r = x;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pointer has its own memory address and size on the stack (4 bytes on x86), whereas a reference shares the same memory address (with the original variable) but also takes up some space on the stack.  Since a reference has the same address as the original variable itself, it is safe to think of a reference as another name for the same variable.  Note: What a pointer points to can be on the stack or heap.  Ditto a reference. My claim in this statement is not that a pointer must point to the stack.  A pointer is just a variable that holds a memory address.  This variable is on the stack.  Since a reference has its own space on the stack, and since the address is the same as the variable it references.  More on &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/79923/what-and-where-are-the-stack-and-heap#79936"&gt;stack vs heap&lt;/a&gt;.  This implies that there is a real address of a reference that the compiler will not tell you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int x = 0;
int &amp;amp;r = x;
int *p = &amp;amp;x;
int *p2 = &amp;amp;r;
assert(p == p2);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can have pointers to pointers to pointers offering extra levels of indirection.  Whereas references only offer one level of indirection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int x = 0;
int y = 0;
int *p = &amp;amp;x;
int *q = &amp;amp;y;
int **pp = &amp;amp;p;
pp = &amp;amp;q;//*pp = q
**pp = 4;
assert(y == 4);
assert(x == 0);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pointer can be assigned NULL directly, whereas reference cannot. If you try hard enough, and you know how, you can make the address of a reference NULL.  Likewise, if you try hard enough you can have a reference to a pointer, and then that reference can contain NULL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int *p = NULL;
int &amp;amp;r = NULL; &amp;lt;--- compiling error
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pointers can iterate over an array, you can use &lt;code&gt;++&lt;/code&gt; to go to the next item that a pointer is pointing to, and &lt;code&gt;+ 4&lt;/code&gt; to go to the 5th element.  This is no matter what size the object is that the pointer points to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pointer needs to be dereferenced with &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; to access the memory location it points to, whereas a reference can be used directly.  A pointer to a class/struct uses &lt;code&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to access it's members whereas a reference uses a &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pointer is a variable that holds a memory address.  Regardless of how a reference is implemented, a reference has the same memory address as the item it references.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;References cannot be stuffed into an array, whereas pointers can be (Mentioned by user @litb)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Const references can be bound to temporaries. Pointers cannot (not without some indirection):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const int &amp;amp;x = int(12); //legal C++

The &lt;code&gt;UpdateSourceTrigger&lt;/code&gt; for these bindings is &lt;code&gt;LostFocus&lt;/code&gt;. The object is saved using the File menu. The problem I have is that it is possible to enter a new value into a TextBox, select Save from the File menu, and never persist the new value (the one visible in the TextBox) because accessing the menu does not remove focus from the TextBox. How can I fix this? Is there some way to force all the controls in a page to databind?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;@palehorse: Good point. Unfortunately, I need to use LostFocus as my UpdateSourceTrigger in order to support the type of validation I want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;@dmo: I had thought of that. It seems, however, like a really inelegant solution for a relatively simple problem. Also, it requires that there be some control on the page which is is always visible to receive the focus. My application is tabbed, however, so no such control readily presents itself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;@Nidonocu: The fact that using the menu did not move focus from the TextBox confused me as well. That is, however, the behavior I am seeing. The following simple example demonstrates my problem:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This simplifies the server code, as there's no need to have a "session" that recalls the state of the client. It also simplifies the client code as there's no need to hold tickets, cookies, or other geegaws that assume something about the state of the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating two services in the way that is described introduces statefulness. The client is either "authenticated" or "not authenticated", and the MyDataService.svc has to figure out which. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it happens, I've found WCF to work well when the membership provider is used to authenticate &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; call to a service. So, in the example given, you'd want to add the membership provider authentication gubbins to the service configuration for MyDataService, and not have a separate authentication service at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[What's very attractive about this to me, as I'm lazy, is that this is entirely declarative. I simply scatter the right configuration entries for my MembershipProvider in the app.config for the application and! bingo! all calls to every contract in the service are authenticated.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's fair to note that this is not going to be particularly quick. If you're using SQL Server for your authentication database you'll have at least one, perhaps two stored procedure calls per service call. In many cases (especially for HTTP bindings) the overhead of the service call itself will be greater; if not, consider rolling your own implementation of a membership provider that caches authentication requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that this &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; give is the ability to provide a "login" capability. For that, you can either provide an (authenticated!) service contract that does nothing (other than raise a fault if the authentication fails), or you can use the membership provider service as described in the original referenced article.&lt;/p&gt;

I need to loop through "area" the first time referencing "state" by index, then when I have the selection of the "state", I need to loop back through a structure using the value of "state" to get the associated "cities". I do want to start with the above structure (although I am free to build it how I want) and I don't mind a conversion similar to @eli's answer (although I was not able to get that conversion to work). Should have been more complete in first question. Trying to implement 2 select boxes where the selection from the first populates the second...I will load this array structure in a js file when the page loads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first thought would be to create a virtual computer in a server-class virtual host (like Virtual Server, HyperV, VMWare). Those virtual machines will run as service (or whatever Hyper V does). The virtual machine would always be running - regardless of logging in and out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make this virtual computer auto login to windows (TweakUI can set this up) and then just launch the GUI app using a shortcut to the Startup folder. You can even remote desktop into it use the program's GUI (I bet Always Up can't do that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My university does not allow our student-mailbox to forward to a private e-mail account (everybody uses either Gmail or Hotmail here). It's a political thing, not technical. We do have IMAP access to the mailbox. I would like to have a service which downloads the mail through IMAP, and forwards. And it would be nice to scale it, so thousands of students can use it. Eventually, I want to build a public signup page, and have it processed automatically from there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I've made a decent PHP script which connects, downloads headers and body parts, and ties it all together. I have two problems with that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) I'm downloading all kind of parts, and sticking them back together. I hope that every exotic attached file, weird encoded piece of text and every type of header survives this. I'm not even sure I have the complete header.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) The to: e-mail address becomes the private e-mail address, not the original student e-mail address. I think this is lame, and inconvenient in searching and archiving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Deciding which functions should be inlined or not depending on how often they are called.&lt;/li&gt;

The value of the right-hand side is returned as the value of the whole expression.
 &lt;code&gt;(expr1, expr2)&lt;/code&gt; is like &lt;code&gt;{ expr1; expr2; }&lt;/code&gt; but you can use the result of &lt;code&gt;expr2&lt;/code&gt; in a function call or assignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is often seen in &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops to initialise or maintain multiple variables like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (low = 0, high = MAXSIZE; low &amp;lt; high; low = newlow, high = newhigh)
{
    /* do something with low and high and put new values
       in newlow and newhigh */
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from this, I've only used it "in anger" in one other case, when wrapping up two operations that should always go together in a macro.  We had code that copied various binary values into a byte buffer for sending on a network, and a pointer maintained where we had got up to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;unsigned char outbuff[BUFFSIZE];
unsigned char *ptr = outbuff;

*ptr++ = first_byte_value;
*ptr++ = second_byte_value;

send_buff(outbuff, (int)(ptr - outbuff));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the values were &lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt;s or &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;s we did this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*((short *)ptr)++ = short_value;
*((int *)ptr)++ = int_value;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later we read that this was not really valid C, because &lt;code&gt;(short *)ptr&lt;/code&gt; is no longer an l-value and can't be incremented, although our compiler at the time didn't mind.  To fix this, we split the expression in two:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*(short *)ptr = short_value;
ptr += sizeof(short);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this approach relied on all developers remembering to put both statements in all the time.  We wanted a function where you could pass in the output pointer, the value and and the value's type.  This being C, not C++ with templates, we couldn't have a function take an arbitrary type, so we settled on a macro:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#define ASSIGN_INCR(p, val, type)  ((*((type) *)(p) = (val)), (p) += sizeof(type))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using the comma operator we were able to use this in expressions or as statements as we wished:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (need_to_output_short)
    ASSIGN_INCR(ptr, short_value, short);

latest_pos = ASSIGN_INCR(ptr, int_value, int);

send_buff(outbuff, (int)(ASSIGN_INCR(ptr, last_value, int) - outbuff));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not suggesting any of these examples are good style!  Indeed, I seem to remember Steve McConnell's &lt;em&gt;Code Complete&lt;/em&gt; advising against even using comma operators in a &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop: for readability and maintainability, the loop should be controlled by only one variable, and the expressions in the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; line itself should only contain loop-control code, not other extra bits of initialisation or loop maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main issue I am running into is when you tell someone with development experience that the position contains "QA" it its title (or even in the job description) they shy away from considering the job.&lt;br /&gt;
I'm very interested in feedback and suggestions for how I can find a good person to fill this job and ensure that they are happy doing it. Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;

Use the OnGetThread event to hand off the ClientSocket param to a new thread of your devising. Once you've instantiated an inherited instance of TServerClientThread you'll create a instance of TWinSocketStream (inside the thread) which you can use to read and write to the socket. This method gets you away from trying to process data in the event handler. These threads could exist for just the short period need to read or write, or hang on for the duration for the purpose of being reused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subject of writing a socket server is fairly vast. There are many techniques and practices you could choose to implement. The method of reading and writing to the same socket with in the TServerClientThread is straight forward and fine for simple applications. If you need a model for high availability and high concurrency then you need to look into patterns like the Proactor pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use attachment_fu in one of my apps and MUST store files in the DB (for annoying reasons which are outside the scope of this convo).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The (one?) tricky thing dealing w/BLOB's I've found is that you need a separate code path to send the data to the user -- you can't simply in-line a path on the filesystem like you would if it was a plain-Jane file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e.g. if you're storing avatar information, you can't simply do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;%= image_tag @youruser.avatar.path %&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you have to write some wrapper logic and use send_data, e.g. (below is JUST an example w/attachment_fu, in practice you'd need to DRY this up)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;send_data(@youruser.avatar.current_data, :type =&amp;gt; @youruser.avatar.content_type, :filename =&amp;gt; @youruser.avatar.filename, :disposition =&amp;gt; 'inline' )
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as far as I know attachment_fu (I don't have the latest version) does not do clever wrapping for you -- you've gotta write it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S.
Seeing your question edit - Attachment_fu handles all that annoying stuff that you mention -- about needing to know file paths and all that crap -- EXCEPT the one little issue when storing in the DB. Give it a try; it's the standard for rails apps. IF you insist on re-inventing the wheel, the source code for attachment_fu should document most of the gotchas, too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The cost of a full time developer for doing the job you require would be too high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most dev's (including myself) would get incredibly fed up, very quickly. Most dev's passion is coding, they want to do it as much as possible. Where TBH, from what you have said, it may be very little in the job role you have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would say perhaps look for a Junior, someone fresh with little experience. They will probably mould better to your testing/QA process, and it gives them a chance to start looking at production code, with perhaps opportunity to work with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unless you are lucky, I would not expect a "developer" to stay for long, so either expect a bit of turnover, or possibly expand to a full dev role if required, and get a cheaper sole tester in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I know you are a small shop, so finances may be a large part to play, but I would say you need to weigh up the possibility of getting a dev in and fixing the problems you have if they occur that often. Testers are cheap by comparison. May be best to get a tester in, find all the issues, then get a contractor/part time dev in to fix issues.&lt;/li&gt;

But giving the QA person the power to dictate policy and procedure, and participate in all aspects of product development so as to keep them in the loop has worked well for us. This means, when it comes to QA and testing, we've got someone who understands the product, knows it inside and out, has been heavily involved from the start, and has heavily shaped the procedures they themselves, and the development team, will follow.

What I've done is create a specific custom message queue in SQL Server 2005. I have a table with messages that contain timestamps for both acknowledgment and completion. The stored procedure that callers execute to obtain the next message in their queue also acknowledges the message. So far so good. Well, if the system is experiencing a massive amount of transactions (thousands per minute), isn't it possible for a message to be acknowledged by another execution of the stored procedure while another is prepared to so itself? Let me help by showing my SQL code in the stored proc:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;--Grab the next message id
declare @MessageId uniqueidentifier
set @MessageId = (select top(1) ActionMessageId from UnacknowledgedDemands);

--Acknowledge the message
update ActionMessages
set AcknowledgedTime = getdate()
where ActionMessageId = @MessageId

--Select the entire message
...
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above code, couldn't another stored procedure running at the same time obtain the same id and attempt to acknowledge it at the same time? Could I (or should I) implement some sort of locking to prevent another stored proc from acknowledging messages that another stored proc is querying? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int * p = NULL;
int &amp;amp; r = *p;
r = 1;  // crash! (if you're lucky)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, it is much harder to do with a reference - but if you manage it, you'll tear your hair out trying to find it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: a few clarifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically, this is an invalid reference, not a null reference.  C++ doesn't support null references as a concept, as you might find in other languages.  There are other kinds of invalid references as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual error is in the dereferencing of the NULL pointer, prior to the assignment to a reference.  But I'm not aware of any compilers that will generate any errors on that condition - the error propagates to a point further along in the code. That's what makes this problem so insidious. Most of the time, if you dereference a NULL pointer, you crash right at that spot and it doesn't take much debugging to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My example above is short and contrived. Here's a more real-world example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class MyClass
{
    ...
    virtual void DoSomething(int,int,int,int,int);
};

void Foo(const MyClass &amp;amp; bar)
{
    ...
    bar.DoSomething(a,Long,list,of,parameters);  // crash occurs here - obvious why?
}

MyClass * GetInstance()
{
    if (somecondition)
        return NULL;
    ...
}

MyClass * p = GetInstance();
Foo(*p);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; Some further thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to reiterate that the only way to get a null reference is through malformed code, and once you have it you're getting undefined behavior. It &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; makes sense to check for a null reference; for example you can try &lt;code&gt;if(&amp;amp;bar==NULL)...&lt;/code&gt; but the compiler might optimize the statement out of existence! A valid reference can never be NULL so from the compiler's view the comparison is always false - this is the essence of undefined behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proper way to stay out of trouble is to avoid dereferencing a NULL pointer to create a reference. Here's an automated way to accomplish this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;template&amp;lt;typename T&amp;gt;
T&amp;amp; ref(T* p)
{
    if (p == NULL)
        throw std::invalid_argument(std::string("NULL reference"));
    return *p;
}

MyClass * p = GetInstance();
Foo(ref(p));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

When I tried to publish my ASP.NET MVC application, all I seemed to get is 404 errors. I've done a bit of googleing and have found a couple of solutions, but neither seem super elegant, and I worry if they will be unusable once I come to use a shared hosting environment for the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/dorony/archive/2007/12/15/using-asp-net-mvc-on-iis-5.aspx"&gt;Solution 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Right-click your application virtual directory on inetmgr.exe.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Properties-&gt;Virtual Directory Tab-&gt; Configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add a new mapping extension. The extension should be .*, which will be
  mapped to the Executable
  C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\aspnet_isapi.dll,
  or the appropriate location on your
  computer (you can simply copy this
  from the mapping for .aspx files). On
  the mapping uncheck "check that file
  exists".&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 X OK and you're good to go.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you want, you can apply this setting to all your web sites. In
  step1, click on the "Default Web Site"
  node instead of your own virtual
  directory, and in step 2 go to the
  "Home Directory" tab. The rest is the
  same.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to think of interfaces as a way to characterize a class.  A particular dog breed class, say a YorkshireTerrier, may be a descended of the parent dog class, but it is also implements IFurry, IStubby, and IYippieDog.  So the class defines what the class is but the interface tells us things about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantage of this is it allows me to, for example, gather all the IYippieDog's and throw them into my Ocean collection.  So now I can reach across a particular set of objects and find ones that meet the criteria I am looking at without inspecting the class too closely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that interfaces really should define a sub-set of the public behavior of a class.  If it defines all the public behavior for all the classes that implement then it usually does not need to exist.  They do not tell me anything useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This thought though goes counter to the idea that every class should have an interface and you should code to the interface.  That's fine, but you end up with a lot of one to one interfaces to classes and it makes things confusing.  I understand that the idea is it does not really cost anything to do and now you can swap things in and out with ease.  However, I find that I rarely do that.  Most of the time I am just modifying the existing class in place and have the exact same issues I always did if the public interface of that class needs changing, except I now have to change it in two places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you think like me you would definitely say that Cat and Dog are IPettable.  It is a characterization that matches them both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other piece of this though is should they have the same base class?  The question is do they need to be broadly treated as the same thing.  Certainly they are both Animals, but does that fit how we are going to use them together.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say I want to gather all Animal classes and put them in my Ark container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or do they need to be Mammals?  Perhaps we need some kind of cross animal milking factory?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do they even need to be linked together at all?  Is it enough to just know they are both IPettable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often feel the desire to derive a whole class hierarchy when I really just need one class.   I do it in anticipation someday I might need it and usually I never do.  Even when I do, I usually find I have to do a lot to fix it.  Thats because the first class I am creating is not the Dog, I am not that lucky, it is instead the Platypus.  Now my entire class hierarchy is based on the bizarre case and I have a lot of wasted code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might also find at some point that not all Cats are IPettable (like that hairless one).  Now you can move that Interface to all the derivative classes that fit.  You will find that a much less breaking change that all of a sudden Cats are no longer derived from PettableBase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going with the gateway/component route. I have looked at several options and settled with this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gateway is basically a component with the specific purpose of bridging Jabber/XMPP with another network. You will have to build most of the things you take for granted when using XMPP as a client. Stuff like roster control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is very little help online on the actual design and building of a component. Like the above answer I found that the xmpp protocols/extensions to be of help. The main ones being:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0211.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Basic Client 2008&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0212.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Basic Server 2008&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0213.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Intermediate Client 2008&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0216.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Intermediate Server 2008&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading through these will show you what XEPs you will be expected to be able to handle. Ignore the stuff that will be handled by the server that your component will be attched to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a shame that Djabberd has such poor documentation as their system of "everything is a module" gave the possibility of backend of the server could interface directly to the other network. I made no headway on this.&lt;/p&gt;

These use however a couple of shared components. So I have a source tree looking something like the below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My Project 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application A&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shared1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shared2 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application B &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application C&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All applications have their own MSBuild script that builds the project and all the shared resources it needs. I also run these builds on a CruiseControl controlled continuous integration build server. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the applications are deployed they are deployed on several servers to distribute load. This means that its &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; important to keep track of what build/revision is deployed on each of the different servers (we need to have the current version in the DLL version, for example 1.0.0.68). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its equally important to be able to recreate a revision/build that been built to be able to roll back if something didnt work out as intended (o yes, that happends ...). Today were using SourceSafe for source control but that possible to change if we could present good reasons for that (SS its actually working ok for us &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; far). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another principle that we try to follow is that its only code that been build and tested by the integration server that we deploy further. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;"CrusieControl Build Labels" solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had several ideas on solving the above. The first was to have the continuous integration server build and locally deploy the project and test it (it does that now). As you probably know a successful build in CruiseControl generates a build label and I guess we somehow could use that to set the DLL version of our executables (so build label 35 would create a DLL like 1.0.0.35 )? The idea was also to use this build label to label the &lt;strong&gt;complete&lt;/strong&gt; source tree. Then we probably could check out by that label and recreate the build later on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for labeling the complete tree is to include not only the actual application code (thats in one place in the source tree) but also all the shared items (thats in different places in the tree). So a successful build of Application A would label to whole tree with label ApplicationA35 for example. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There might however be an issue when trying to recreate this build and setting the DLL version before deploying as we then dont have access to the CruiseControl generated build label anymore. If all CrusieControl build labels were unique for all the projects we could use only the number for labeling but thats not the case (both application A and B could at the same time be on build 35) so we have to include the application name in the label. Hence SourceSafe label Application35. &lt;strong&gt;How can I then recreate build 34 and set 1.0.0.34 to the DLL version numbers once we built build 35?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;"Revision number" solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone told me that Subversion for example creates a revision number for the entire source tree on every check in  &lt;strong&gt;is this the case? Has SourceSafe something similar?&lt;/strong&gt; If this is correct the idea is then to grab that revision number when getting latest and build on the CruiseControl server. The revision number could then be used to set the DLL version number (to for example 1.0.0.5678). I guess we could then get this specific revision for the Subversion if needed and that then would include that application and all the shared items to be able to recreate a specific version from the past. &lt;strong&gt;Would that work and could this also be achived using SourceSafe?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Summarize&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the two main requirements are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be able to &lt;strong&gt;track build/revision number of the build and deployed DLL.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be able to &lt;strong&gt;rebuild a past revision/build, set the old build/revision number on the executables of that build&lt;/strong&gt; (to comply with requirement 1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how would you solve this?&lt;/strong&gt; What would be your preferred approach and &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; would you solve it (or do you have a totally different idea?)? **Pleased give detailed answers. **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bonus question&lt;/em&gt; What are the difference between a revision number and a build number and when would one really need both?&lt;/p&gt;

I created a SP to query the table as described in the code below the table create statement.  My issue is that, sporadically, calls from .NET to this SP both through the Enterprise Library 4 and through a DataReader object are slow.  The SP is called through a loop structure in the Data Layer that specifies the params that go into the SP for the purpose of populating user objects.  It's also important to mention that a slow call will not take place on every pass the loop structure.  It will generally be fine for most of a day or more, and then start presenting which makes it extremely hard to debug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The table in question contains about 5 million rows.  The calls that are slow, for instance, will take as long as 10 seconds, while the calls that are fast will take 0 to 10 milliseconds on average.  I checked for locking/blocking transactions during the slow calls, none were found.  I created some custom performance counters in the data layer to monitor call times.  Essentially, when performance is bad, it's really bad for that one call.  But when it's good, it's really good.  I've been able to recreate the issue on a few different developer machines, but not on our development and staging database servers, which of course have beefier hardware.  Generally, the problem is resolved through restarting the SQL server services, but not always.  There are indexes on the table for the fields I'm querying, but there are more indexes than I would like.  However, I'm hesitant to remove any or toy with the indexes due to the impact it may have on the legacy system.  Has anyone experienced a problem like this before, or do you have a recommendation to remedy it?  &lt;/p&gt;

In C++ if you bind a const reference to a temporary object, the lifetime of that object becomes the lifetime of the reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;std::string s1 = "123";

&lt;p&gt;In this example s3_copy copies the temporary object that is a result of the concatenation. Whereas s3_reference in essence becomes the temporary object. It's really a reference to a temporary object that now has the same lifetime as the reference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you try this without the &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; it should fail to compile. You cannot bind a non-const reference to a temporary object, nor can you take its address for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If *.mvc extension is not registered
  to the hosting , it will give 404
  exception. The working way of hosting
  MVC apps in that case is to modify
  global.asax routing caluse in the
  following way.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;routes.Add(new
  Route("{controller}.mvc.aspx/{action}",
  new MvcRouteHandler()) {
      Defaults = new RouteValueDictionary (new{ controller
  = "YourController"} ) });&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;In this way all your controller
  request will end up in *.mvc.aspx,
  which is recognized by your hosting.
  And as the MVC dlls are copied into
  your local bin , no special setttings
  need to be done for it.&lt;/p&gt;

However, we've recently migrated to forms authentication using ASP.NET and wildcard mapping.  Everything works surprisingly well except for one thing: logged in users are timing out too quickly.  After looking in the logs it appears people are timing out exactly after 20 minutes (which is the specified timeout due to inactivity).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, our hypothesis is that the ASP classic pages are not tripping whatever mechanism in the forms authentication framework that resets the inactivity timer.  I've googled around and even read the wildcard mapping post by the Great Gu but still can't find anyone else who is having this problem.  So, 1) Have you ever seen this problem? and 2) What's the best workaround? (other than manually placing a hidden frame in every janky ASP page that loads a dumb .NET page in the background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also&lt;/strong&gt;: We can't use perpetual sessions because we need the application to time out after 20 minutes of inactivity.  Also, this terrible site was written so that the interface is usually stored in the page.  There's no simple piece of interface code I could slip the JavaScript into.  We tried to put some js into an include file that was called by about 80% of our pages but it's caused some esoteric problems with file download buffers so we may have to try a different tack.

&lt;p&gt;Consider the HTTP Request pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A request comes into IIS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IIS checks port/host header to see if it has a web site set up to capture requests for that host header/port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IIS investigates the file extension of the request (.php, .asp, .aspx) and hands it off to an ISAPI  that can handle that type of request.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only at this point does ASP.NET (or a PHP runtime) kick in.&lt;/strong&gt; If IIS does't have that mapping then it'll never hand off the request to the ASP.NET runtime and the request will never reach your code. That's why you need that glob (*) mapping to the ASP.NET ISAPI. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASP.NET MVC framework urls often end with no file extension at all. If you want these requests to get handled by ASP.NET (or some other runtime) you have to map all requests regardless of the file extension to that ISAPI (ie. aspnet_isapi.dll). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is often also done for HttpHandlers that need to serve off media like .jpg, .gif. For the handler to be hit it needs to get mapped to your code even though .jpg isn't a "normal" ASP.NET file extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially you end up emitting some JavaScript and an image tag in your master page or navigation users controls (whatever you're using for consistent navigation). This JavaScript on some interval changes the source of the image tag to an http handler endpoint (some .aspx, .ashx) which returns a 1x1 pix clear gif as a response for the image. The constant request ensures that idle pages will keep the session alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As long as a browser window is open to your page your ASP.NET session will never time out.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often the JavaScript will tack on a random number to the request so that the browser doesn't cache the request.&lt;/p&gt;

When authenticating the service will try to set an authentication cookie. I need to get this cookie out of the response, and add it to any other request made to other web services on the same machine. The code to do that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var authService = new AuthService.AuthenticationServiceClient();
var diveService = new DiveLogService.DiveLogServiceClient();

string cookieHeader = "";
using (OperationContextScope scope = new OperationContextScope(authService.InnerChannel))

    OperationContext.Current.OutgoingMessageProperties[HttpRequestMessageProperty.Name] = requestProperty;
    bool isGood = authService.Login("jonas", "jonas", string.Empty, true);
    MessageProperties properties = OperationContext.Current.IncomingMessageProperties;
    HttpResponseMessageProperty responseProperty = (HttpResponseMessageProperty)properties[HttpResponseMessageProperty.Name];
    cookieHeader = responseProperty.Headers[HttpResponseHeader.SetCookie];

    httpRequest.Headers.Add(HttpRequestHeader.Cookie, cookieHeader);

&lt;p&gt;As you can see I have two service clients, one fo the authentication service, and one for the service I'm actually going to use. The first block will call the Login method, and grab the authentication cookie out of the response. The second block will add the header to the request before calling the "GetDives" service method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off the top of my head, you can do it for hashes, arrays, and ActiveRecord objects, which should cover about 95% of the use cases you might want. If you have your own custom objects, it's trivial to write your own &lt;code&gt;to_json&lt;/code&gt; method for them, which can just jam data into a hash and then return the jsonized hash.&lt;/p&gt;

So I wanted to present the question to the stackoverflow crowd ... what would be the best way to set up an automated build and deployment system using the following configuration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual Studio 2008&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web Application Project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CruiseControl.NET&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first things I tried was to have CCnet automatically zip the output and copy it to the server, but then that requires manual work to unzip at the destination.  However, if we try to copy all the files individually, then it could potentially take a long time if it's a large application (build server lives outside of the datacenter in our office ... I know).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also of particular interest is how we would support multiple environments as we have dev, qa, uat, and then of course prod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.iis.net/msdeploy/archive/2008/01/22/welcome-to-the-web-deployment-team-blog.aspx"&gt;MSDeploy&lt;/a&gt; seems really interesting, but unless I'm interpreting the literature incorrectly, doesn't help in the scenario of deploying from the output of a build server.  If anything, it seems like it'll be useful in deploying one build across a build farm ... but even for deploying from one environment to another, one would have to manually change config settings and web service URLs, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

This can be important if you're using a tie-ed hash to a database with millions of rows.  You don't want to generate the entire list of keys all at once and exhaust your physical memory.  In this case each serves as an iterator whereas keys actually generates the entire array before the loop starts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AnimationExtender catches action and call clickOn callback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;linkPostback starts asynchronous request for page and then returns flow to AnimationExtender&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animation begins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pageRequest returns and calls playAnimation, which starts the animation again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there are at least two ways around this issue.  It seems you have almost all the javascript you need, you just need to work around AnimationExtender starting the animation on a click.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Option 1: Hide the AnimationExtender button and add a new button of your own that plays the animation.  This should be as simple as setting the AE button's style to "display: none;" and having your own button call linkPostback().&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Option 2: Re-disable the Animation Extender once the animation has finished with.  This should work, as long as the playAnimation call is blocking, which it probably is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function linkPostback() {

    var prm = Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManager.getInstance();
    prm.add_endRequest(playAnimation)
}

function playAnimation() {

    AnimationExtender.Enabled = true;
    var onclkBehavior = $find("ctl00_btnOpenList").get_OnClickBehavior().get_animation();
    onclkBehavior.play();
    AnimationExtender.Enabled = false;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, it seems your general approach may face issues if there is a delay in receiving the pageRequest.  It may be a bit weird to click a button and several seconds later have the animation happen.  It may be better to either pre-load the data, or to pre-fill the div with some "Loading..." thing, make it about the right size, and then populate the actual contents when it arrives.&lt;/p&gt;

The thread executing the delegate will be blocked until the user hits 'enter', with no way to cancel it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issuing a sequence of these calls will not behave as you would expect.  Consider the following (using the example Console class from above):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;System.Console.WriteLine("Enter your first name [John]:");

string firstName = Console.ReadLine(5, "John");

System.Console.WriteLine("Enter your last name [Doe]:");

string lastName = Console.ReadLine(5, "Doe");
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user lets the timeout expire for the first prompt, then enters a value for the second prompt.  Both firstName and lastName will contain the default values. When the user hits 'enter', the &lt;strong&gt;first&lt;/strong&gt; ReadLine call will complete, but the code has abandonded that call and essentially discarded the result.  The &lt;strong&gt;second&lt;/strong&gt; ReadLine call will continue to block, the timeout will eventually expire and the value returned will again be the default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW- There is a bug in the code above.  By calling waitHandle.Close() you close the event out from under the worker thread.  If the user hits 'enter' after the timeout expires, the worker thread will attempt to signal the event which throws an ObjectDisposedException.  The exception is thrown from the worker thread, and if you haven't setup an unhandled exception handler your process will terminate.&lt;/p&gt;

I found that the onbeforeunload event (which I think is IE-specific, which works fine for me as the project uses lots of ActiveX) works great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem is, I want the user to be able to click on a little "help" icon in the upper-right corner and pop up a help window at any time. This causes onbeforeunload to fire, even though the main window never goes anywhere and the page never unloads. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JavaScript function that runs when the onbeforeunload event runs just puts text into event.returnValue. If I could ascertain, somehow, that the help icon is the one that was clicked then I could just not put text into event.returnValue in that situation. But how could I have the page figure that out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let say you have a class with two methods GetA which return this and GetB which return another object:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you can call obj.GetA().GetB(), but not obj.GetB().GetA(), which at least doesn't seems consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Pascal (and Visual Basic) you can call several methods of the same object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK so while I was writing the question, I came up with a workaround which will work for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put a global JavaScript variable in act as a boolean on whether or not the icon is being hovered over. Then, I attach events to the image's onmouseover and onmouseout events and write functions that will set this value. Finally, I just code in the function that handles onbeforeunload that will check this value before setting event.returnValue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably not a flawless workaround but it will work for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You seem to be confusing two &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; different things here: the 
Ruby Programming Language and the specific threading model of one 
specific implementation of the Ruby Programming Language. There 
are currently around 11 different implementations of the Ruby 
Programming Language, with &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; different and unique threading 
models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Unfortunately, only two of those 11 implementations are actually 
ready for production use, but by the end of the year that number 
will probably go up to four or five.) (&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: it's now 5: MRI, JRuby, YARV (the interpreter for Ruby 1.9), Rubinius and IronRuby).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first implementation doesn't actually have a name, which 
makes it quite awkward to refer to it and is really annoying and 
confusing. It is most often referred to as "Ruby", which is even 
more annoying and confusing than having no name, because it 
leads to endless confusion between the features of the Ruby 
Programming Language and a particular Ruby Implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also sometimes called "MRI" (for "Matz's Ruby 
Implementation"), CRuby or MatzRuby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://RedMine.Ruby-Lang.Org/repositories/annotate/ruby-18/ext/thread/thread.c"&gt;MRI implements Ruby Threads as Green Threads within its 
interpreter&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, it doesn't allow those threads 
to be scheduled in parallel, they can only run one thread at a 
time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, any number of C Threads (POSIX Threads etc.) can run 
in parallel to the Ruby Thread, so external C Libraries, or MRI 
C Extensions that create threads of their own can still run in 
parallel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second implementation is &lt;a href="http://WWW.AtDot.Net/yarv/"&gt;YARV&lt;/a&gt; (short for "Yet 
Another Ruby VM"). &lt;a href="http://RedMine.Ruby-Lang.Org/repositories/annotate/ruby-19/thread.c"&gt;YARV implements Ruby Threads as POSIX or 
Windows NT Threads&lt;/a&gt;, however, it uses a Global Interpreter 
Lock (GIL) to ensure that only one Ruby Thread can actually be 
scheduled at any one time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like MRI, C Threads &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; actually run parallel to Ruby Threads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, it is possible, that the GIL &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; get broken 
down into more fine-grained locks, thus allowing more and more 
code to actually run in parallel, but that's so far away, it is 
not even &lt;em&gt;planned&lt;/em&gt; yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://JRuby.Org/"&gt;JRuby&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://SVN.JRuby.CodeHaus.Org/browse/jruby/trunk/jruby/src/org/jruby/RubyThread.java?r=HEAD"&gt;implements Ruby Threads as Native Threads&lt;/a&gt;, 
where "Native Threads" in case of the JVM obviously means "JVM 
Threads". JRuby imposes no additional locking on them. So, 
whether those threads can actually run in parallel depends on 
the JVM: some JVMs implement JVM Threads as OS Threads and some 
as Green Threads. (The mainstream JVMs from Sun/Oracle use exclusively OS threads since JDK 1.3)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://XRuby.GoogleCode.Com/"&gt;XRuby&lt;/a&gt; also &lt;a href="http://Code.Google.Com/p/xruby/source/browse/trunk/src/com/xruby/runtime/builtin/RubyThread.java#21"&gt;implements Ruby Threads as JVM Threads&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: XRuby is dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://IronRuby.Net/"&gt;IronRuby&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://IronRuby.RubyForge.Org/svn/trunk/src/IronRuby.Libraries/Builtins/ThreadOps.cs"&gt;implements Ruby Threads as Native Threads&lt;/a&gt;, 
where "Native Threads" in case of the CLR obviously means 
"CLR Threads". IronRuby imposes no additional locking on them, 
so, they should run in parallel, as long as your CLR supports 
that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://RubyDotNetCompiler.GoogleCode.Com/"&gt;Ruby.NET&lt;/a&gt; also &lt;a href="http://Code.Google.Com/p/rubydotnetcompiler/source/browse/trunk/src/RubyRuntime/Built-in%20Classes/Thread.cs#21"&gt;implements Ruby Threads as CLR 
Threads&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Ruby.NET is dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://Rubini.us/"&gt;Rubinius&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://GitHub.Com/EvanPhx/Rubinius/tree/master/kernel/core/thread.rb#L9"&gt;implements Ruby Threads as Green Threads 
within its Virtual Machine&lt;/a&gt;. More precisely: the Rubinius 
VM exports a very lightweight, very flexible 
concurrency/parallelism/non-local control-flow construct, called 
a "&lt;a href="https://GitHub.Com/EvanPhx/Rubinius/tree/cpp/vm/builtin/task.cpp"&gt;Task&lt;/a&gt;", and all other concurrency constructs (Threads in 
this discussion, but also &lt;a href="https://GitHub.Com/EvanPhx/Rubinius/tree/master/kernel/core/continuation.rb#L45"&gt;Continuations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://GitHub.Com/EvanPhx/Rubinius/tree/master/lib/actor.rb#L31"&gt;Actors&lt;/a&gt; and 
other stuff) are implemented in pure Ruby, using Tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rubinius can not (currently) schedule Threads in parallel, 
however, adding that isn't too much of a problem: Rubinius can 
already &lt;a href="https://GitHub.Com/EvanPhx/Rubinius/tree/master/kernel/core/vm.rb#L5"&gt;run several VM instances in several POSIX Threads in 
parallel&lt;/a&gt;, within one Rubinius process. Since Threads are 
actually implemented in Ruby, they can, like any other Ruby 
object, be serialized and sent to a different VM in a different 
POSIX Thread. (That's the same model the BEAM &lt;a href="http://Erlang.Org/"&gt;Erlang&lt;/a&gt; VM 
uses for SMP concurrency. It is already &lt;a href="https://GitHub.Com/EvanPhx/Rubinius/tree/master/lib/vmactor.rb"&gt;implemented for 
Rubinius Actors&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: The information about Rubinius in this answer is about the Shotgun VM, which doesn't exist anymore. The "new" C++ VM does not use green threads scheduled across multiple VMs (i.e. Erlang/BEAM style), it uses a more traditional single VM with multiple native OS threads model, just like the one employed by, say, the CLR, Mono, and pretty much every JVM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://MacRuby.Org/"&gt;MacRuby&lt;/a&gt; started out as a port of YARV on top of the 
Objective-C Runtime and CoreFoundation and Cocoa Frameworks. It 
has now significantly diverged from YARV, but AFAIK it currently 
still &lt;a href="http://MacRuby.Org/trac/browser/MacRuby/trunk/thread.c?annotate=blame"&gt;shares the same Threading Model with YARV&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; MacRuby depends on apples garbage collector which is declared deprecated and will be removed in later versions of MacOSX, MacRuby is undead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://Cardinal2.RubyForge.Org/"&gt;Cardinal&lt;/a&gt; is a Ruby Implementation for the &lt;a href="http://ParrotCode.Org/"&gt;Parrot 
Virtual Machine&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn't implement threads yet, however, 
when it does, it will probably implement them as &lt;a href="http://SVN.Perl.Org/viewvc/parrot/trunk/src/thread.c?view=annotate"&gt;Parrot 
Threads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://MagLev.GemStone.Com/"&gt;MagLev&lt;/a&gt; is a Ruby Implementation for the &lt;a href="http://GemStone.Com/products/smalltalk/"&gt;GemStone/S 
Smalltalk VM&lt;/a&gt;. I have no information what threading model 
GemStone/S uses, what threading model MagLev uses or even if 
threads are even implemented yet (probably not).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://HotRuby.Yukoba.Jp/"&gt;HotRuby&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a full Ruby Implementation of its 
own. It is an implementation of a YARV bytecode VM in 
JavaScript. HotRuby doesn't support threads (yet?) and when it 
does, they won't be able to run in parallel, because JavaScript 
has no support for true parallelism. There is an ActionScript 
version of HotRuby, however, and ActionScript might actually 
support parallelism. &lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: HotRuby is dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, only two of these 11 Ruby Implementations are 
actually production-ready: MRI and JRuby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you want true parallel threads, JRuby is currently your 
only choice not that that's a bad one: JRuby is actually faster 
than MRI, and arguably more stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, the "classical" Ruby solution is to use processes 
instead of threads for parallelism. The Ruby Core Library 
contains the &lt;a href="http://Ruby-Doc.Org/core/classes/Process.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Process&lt;/code&gt; module&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href="http://Ruby-Doc.Org/core/classes/Process.html#M003179"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Process.fork&lt;/code&gt; 
method&lt;/a&gt; which makes it dead easy to fork off another Ruby 
process. Also, the Ruby Standard Library contains the 
&lt;a href="http://Ruby-Doc.Org/stdlib/libdoc/drb/rdoc/"&gt;Distributed Ruby (dRuby / dRb)&lt;/a&gt; library, which allows Ruby 
code to be trivially distributed across multiple processes, not 
only on the same machine but also across the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also testing the practice of building new areas of the application in new solutions, importing in the latest dlls as required, them integrating them into the larger solution when we are happy with them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may also do them same to existing code by creating temporary solutions that just encapsulate the areas we need to work on, and throwing them away after reintegrating the code. We need to weigh up the time it will take to reintegrate this code against the time we gain by not having Rip Van Winkle like experiences with rapid recompiling during development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orion did mention in a comment that generics may have a play also. From my tests there does appear to be a minimal performance hit, but not high enough to sure - compile times can be inconsistent due to disc activity. Due to time limitations, my tests didn't include as many Generics, or as much code, as would appear in live system, so that may accumulate. I wouldn't avoid using generics where they are supposed to be used, just for compile time performance&lt;/p&gt;

For me, it's a mistake to get sucked into a Mockist vs. Classicist debate, as such a discussion is misleading. State-based and behaviuour-based unit testing are two different tools in your toolbox, and there's no reason why they should be mutually exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State-based unit testing is suitable when you want to query the internal properties of an object after talking to its external interface. If one or more of its collaborators involve potentially expensive calls to other objects, then by all means stub those calls and simply disregard collaborators. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behaviour-based unit testing is a good idea when you want to consider the "how" of a unit test and focus upon discoving relationships between objects, as opposed to the traditional "what" questions of a state-based unit test. If you wish to assert that collaborators are used in a certain way and/or sequential order, use mocks - stubs that provide assertions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest you focus upon standard unit testing practices - exercise as little production code as possible, and have &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; assertion per test. This will force you to think "what exactly is it that I want to exercise and assert in this test?", and the answer to that question will help you choose the correct unit testing tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;as&lt;/code&gt; cast operator&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code&gt;Foo foo = bar as Foo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;'is' test&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code&gt;bool is = bar is Foo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;classic cast&lt;/strong&gt; needs to needs to check if bar can be safely cast to Foo (quick), and then actually do it (slower), or throw an exception (really slow).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;as&lt;/code&gt; operator&lt;/strong&gt; needs to check if bar can be cast, then do the cast, or if it cannot be safely cast, then it just returns null.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; operator&lt;/strong&gt; just checks if bar can be cast to Foo, and return a boolean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; test is quick, because it only does the first part of a full casting operation. The &lt;strong&gt;as&lt;/strong&gt; operator is quicker than a classic cast because doesn't throw an exception if the cast fails (which makes it good for situations where you legitimately expect that the cast might fail).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you just need to know if the variable &lt;strong&gt;bar&lt;/strong&gt; is a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; then use the &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; operator, &lt;strong&gt;BUT&lt;/strong&gt;, if you're going to test if &lt;strong&gt;bar&lt;/strong&gt; is a &lt;strong&gt;Foo&lt;/strong&gt;, and if so, &lt;strong&gt;then cast it&lt;/strong&gt;, then you should use the &lt;strong&gt;as&lt;/strong&gt; operator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially every cast needs to do the equivalent of an &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; check internally to begin with, in order to ensure that the cast is valid. So if you do an &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; check followed by a full cast (either an &lt;code&gt;as&lt;/code&gt; cast, or with the classic cast operator) you are effectively doing the &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; check twice, which is a slight extra overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

Not as an academic exercise on commercial code anyway. If it's working don't re-write it.

&lt;p&gt;In practise if you haven't done a lot of OOP, then you'll want to start small and get a feel for it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you get a handle on the basics, a good beginners guide to Design Patterns (I like the Head First book) is very useful. Most PHP books would teach you OOP fairly poorly. They teach you about inheritance, but usually don't teach you about loose coupling and favouring composition over inheritance. A design patterns book will give you a better insight into this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PHP still has a reputation for not "doing" OO right. I don't think this is fair, but is a reflection of the fact that it's so easy for people to get started without really grokking OOP. I would go out on a limb and say the majority (ever so slightly - call it 51%) of PHP programmers aren't comfortable with OOP. I think it's possible to do good OO in PHP, and if you're already comfortable with the language it's a great way to grow your skills.&lt;/p&gt;

One is the set of already visited nodes and the other is the set of nodes that are directly reachable from the visited nodes but are not visited themselves. Then you keep moving states from the latter set to the former, adding newly reachable states to the latter. If you need the have a path from the root to some node(s), then you will also need to store a parent node for each node (except the root) in the aforementioned sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually the union of the set of visited nodes and the set of not-visited child nodes (i.e. the set of seen nodes) is stored in a hash table. This is to be able to quickly determine whether or not a "new" state has been seen before and ignore it if this is the case. If you have really big number of states you might indeed need a bit array (as mentioned by Joseph Bui (&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/57471/c-graph-traversal-tracking-path-between-any-two-nodes#57509" rel="nofollow"&gt;57509&lt;/a&gt;), but unless your states can be used (directly or indirectly) as indices to that array, you will need to use a hash function to map states to indices. In the latter case you might completely ignore certain states because they are mapped to the same index as a different (and seen) node, so you might want to be careful with this. Also, to get a path you still need to store the parent information which pretty much negates the use of the bit-array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The browser requests a page, say SendEmails.aspx&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially what you do is have your submit button begin the e-mail processing in an asynchronous state, while the user is taken to an intermediate page. The benefit to this is that you can have your intermediate page refresh as much as needed, without worrying about hitting the standard timeouts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your background process is complete, it will put a little "done" flag in the database/application variable/whatever. When your intermediate page does a refresh of itself, it detects this flag and automatically redirects the user to the "done" page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, AJAX makes all of this moot, but if for some reason you have a very intensive or timely process that has to be done over the web, this solution will work for you. I found a nice tutorial on it &lt;a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/dotnet/asp.net/asynchronous-client-script-callbacks/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and there are plenty more out there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I had a run through MEF and wrote up a quick "Hello World", which is presented below. I gotta say it was totally easy to dive into and understand. The catalog system is great and makes extending MEF itself very straight forward. It's trivial to point it at a directory of addin assemblies and let it handle the rest. MEF's heritage ala Prism certainly shows through, but I think it would be odd if it didn't, given that both frameworks are about composition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the thing that sticks in my craw the most is the "magic" of _container.Compose(). If you look in at the HelloMEF class, you'll see that the greetings field is never initialized by any of the code, which just feels funny. I think I prefer the way IoC containers work, where you explicitly ask the container to build an object for you. I wonder if some sort of "Nothing" or "Empty" generic initializer might be in order. i.e.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;private IGreetings greetings = CompositionServices.Empty&amp;lt;IGreetings&amp;gt;();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That at least fills the object with "something" until such time as the container composition code runs to fill it with a real "something". I don't know - it smacks a little bit of Visual Basic's Empty or Nothing keywords, which I always disliked. If anyone else has some thoughts on this, I'd like to hear them. Maybe it's something I just need to get over. It is marked with a big fat [Import] attribute, so it's not like it's a complete mystery or anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Controlling object lifetime isn't obvious, but everything is a singleton by default unless you add a [CompositionOptions] attribute to the exported class. That let's you specify either Factory or Singleton. It would be nice to see Pooled added to this list at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not really clear on how the duck typing features work. It seems more like meta-data injection upon object creation rather than duck typing. And it looks like you can only add  in one additional duck. But like I said, I'm not really clear on how these feature work just yet. Hopefully I can come back and fill this in later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it would be a good idea to shadow copy the DLLs that are loaded by DirectoryPartCatalog. Right now the DLLs are locked once MEF gets a hold of them. This would also allow you to add a directory watcher and catch updated addins. That would be pretty sweet...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I'm worried about how trusted the addin DLLs are and how, or if, MEF will behave in a partial trust environment. I suspect applications using MEF will require full trust. It might also be prudent to load the addins up in their own AppDomain. I know it smacks a bit of System.AddIn, but it would allow very clear separation between user addins and system addins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay - enough blathering. Here's Hello World in MEF and C#. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

    }

    {

        private IGreetings greetings = null;

        }

&lt;p&gt;A quick summary: When serializing, the object makes a dictionary out of all environment variables, but appears to run a ToLower() on all entries.  So, if you have two environment variables that are the same except for casing, you'll get a crash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is only going to be a problem when running from inside a system like cygwin which enforces case sensitivity for variables.  In our case, we're using make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple solutions, but they all revolve around making sure that your environment doesn't have any duplicated variables when your c# app runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Asynchronous pages offer a neat
  solution to the problems caused by
  I/O-bound requests. Page processing
  begins on a thread-pool thread, but
  that thread is returned to the thread
  pool once an asynchronous I/O
  operation begins in response to a
  signal from ASP.NET. When the
  operation completes, ASP.NET grabs
  another thread from the thread pool
  and finishes processing the request.
  Scalability increases because
  thread-pool threads are used more
  efficiently. Threads that would
  otherwise be stuck waiting for I/O to
  complete can now be used to service
  other requests. The direct
  beneficiaries are requests that don't
  perform lengthy I/O operations and can
  therefore get in and out of the
  pipeline quickly. Long waits to get
  into the pipeline have a
  disproportionately negative impact on
  the performance of such requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this same editing process, users can define (and change) a list of valid values that can be stored in these user created fields (if the user wants to limit what can be in the field).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the user changes the list of valid entries for a field, if they remove one of the valid values, they are allowed to choose a new "valid value" to map any rows that have this (now invalid) value in it, so that they now have a valid value again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In looking through the old code, I noticed that it is extremely vulnerable to putting the system into an invalid state, because the changes mentioned above are not done within a transaction (so if someone else came along halfway through the process mentioned above and made their own changes... well, you can imagine the problems that might cause).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is, I've been trying to get them to update under a single transaction, but whenever the code gets to the part where it changes the schema of that table, all of the other changes (updating values in rows, be it in the table where the schema changed or not... they can be completely unrelated tables even) made up to that point in the transaction appear to be silently dropped.  I receive no error message indicating that they were dropped, and when I commit the transaction at the end no error is raised... but when I go to look in the tables that were supposed to be updated in the transaction, only the new columns are there.  None of the non-schema changes made are saved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking on the net for answers has, thus far, proved to be a waste of a couple hours... so I turn here for help.  Has anyone ever tried to perform a transaction through ADO that both updates the schema of a table and updates rows in tables (be it that same table, or others)?  Is it not allowed?  Is there any documentation out there that could be helpful in this situation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(I don't know what's happening here, looks like it's creating a temporary stored procedure...?)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;

int set @p1=180150003 declare @p3 int
set @p3=2 declare @p4 int set @p4=4
declare @p5 int set @p5=-1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Retreiving the table that holds definition information for the user-generated fields)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

go
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(I think my code was iterating through the list of them here, grabbing the current information)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all that ado above, only the deletion of the column occurs.  Everything before and after it in the transaction appears to be ignored, and there were no messages in the SQL Trace to indicate that something went wrong during the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to convert this table into a list of the "Top Ten" teams. The rules are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each team score is taken from the sum of four members of that club.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These totals should be of the best four scores except...
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each team must consist of at least one Junior or Lady&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example in the table above the team score for club A would be 625 &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; 640 as you would take the scores for Harry(190), Bert(150), Jim(150), and Simon(130). You could not take Fred's(145) score as that would give you only Gents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is, can this be done easily as a series of Excel formula, or will I need to resort to using something more procedural?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally the solution needs to be automatic in the team selections, I don't want to have to create separate hand crafted formula for each team. I also will not necessarily have a neatly ordered list of each clubs members. Although I could probably generate the list via an extra calculation sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

(6.5.2.1) Adding all the rules from the standard about arrays, addressing, etc. you get that the second subscript references consecutive integers, wheras the first subscript will reference consecutive 5-int objects. (So 3 is the bigger number; you have 5 ints between &lt;strong&gt;x[1]&lt;/strong&gt;[0] and &lt;strong&gt;x[2]&lt;/strong&gt;[0].)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for example, some of the applications I work with use settings which we access with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;string blah = AppLib.Properties.Settings.Default.TemplatePath;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this option seems cool because the members are stongly typed, and I won't be able to type in a property name that doesn't exist in the Visual Studio 2005 IDE. We end up with lines like this in the App.Config of a command-line executable project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &amp;lt;connectionStrings&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;add name="AppConnectionString" connectionString="XXXX" /&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;add name="AppLib.Properties.Settings.AppConnectionString" connectionString="XXXX" /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/connectionStrings&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If we don't have the second setting, someone releasing a debug dll to the live box could have built with the debug connection string embedded in it - eek)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have settings accessed like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;string blah = System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["TemplatePath_PDF"];
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, these seem cool because we can access the setting from the dll code, or the exe / aspx code, and all we need in the Web or App.config is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &amp;lt;appSettings&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;add key="TemplatePath_PDF" value="xxx"/&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/appSettings&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the value of course may not be set in the config files, or the string name may be mistyped, and so we have a different set of problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So... if my understanding is correct, the former methods give strong typing but bad sharing of values between the dll and other projects. The latter provides better sharing, but weaker typing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I must be missing something. For the moment, I'm not even concerned with the application being able to write-back values to the configuration files, encryption or anything like that. Also, I had decided that the best way to store any non-connection strings was in the DB... and then the very next thing that I have to do is store phone numbers to text people in case of DB connection issues, so they must be stored outside the DB!&lt;/p&gt;

Its usefulness definitely depends on what you are planning to run on it. If you are running Apache with the multiple threads core it will love it as it can run the individual response threads on the individual cpu cores. If you are simply running single thread processes you will get some performance increases over a single cpu box but not as great (any old fashioned non mod_perl/mod_python CGID processes would still be sharing the the cpu a bit).

&lt;p&gt;The C# language shouldn't give you much problem if you have very much experience with Java at all (or even CFScript).  As a reference, though, when I was starting, I found &lt;a href="http://www.csharp-station.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;csharp-station&lt;/a&gt; a good primer for language basics.  It won't help you much as far as the ASP.NET side goes; but it is good for syntax.  More you'll be familiarizing yourself with the .NET libraries.  The IDE actually can be an enormous help here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the three biggest differences I found making the transition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ASP.NET Server Controls&lt;/strong&gt; - In ColdFusion, you really have pretty
direct control over the HTML; you
work very closely with the page. 
This isn't so much the case in
ASP.NET.  The server controls are
meant to relieve you of a lot of the
tedium, but at a cost of maybe some
direct control.  As a CF programmer,
I'm very particular about what gets
actually output to the browser; and
at first ASP.NET frustrated me
because it spits out a lot of extra
code.  Still, the controls are
really powerful, and it pays to
familiarize yourself with them. 
Form and validation controls,
especially, save you from a lot of
the tedium in CF of handling post
back and validation.  W3Schools
actually has a decent &lt;a href="http://www.w3schools.com/ASPNET/aspnet_refwebcontrols.asp" rel="nofollow"&gt;list of web
server controls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The page model&lt;/strong&gt; - ColdFusion is pretty agnostic in terms of page
flow.  ASP.NET is very much geared
towards using post backs, and is
very event driven.  If you're not
using a framework with CF (e.g.
Model Glue), this may be foreign to
you.  .NET takes care of handling a
lot of the post back behavior for
you.  Also, not to say that
ColdFusion can't be object and
function driven by good use of
CFC's, but ASP.NET really tries to
push you down the OO path compared
to CF in my experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Database access&lt;/strong&gt; - Using ASP.NET really made me appreciate how
powerful cfquery really is.  The
csharp-station site also has a good
tutorial on working with the native
.NET db tools.  I haven't worked on
enough projects yet to start looking
around for DB access extensions; I'm
pretty sure Jeff recommended
something that they used for
building this site, so you might
check that out.  Otherwise, I really
suggest you familiarize yourself
with the DataSet object.  It's
somewhat similar to a query object
in CF, and lets you run query of
queries, etc...  Looping over
queries in CF is very common, but it
doesn't happen nearly as much in
ASP.NET because of data binding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

More control in the sense that you want EVERY browser to see exactly the same markup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you create System.Web.UI.HtmlControls like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input id='btnCancel' runat='server' type='button' value='Cancel' /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you know what kind of code is going to be emitted. Even though most of the time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;asp:Button id='btnCancel' runat='server' Text='Cancel' /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;will end up being the same markup. The same markup is not always emitted for all WebControls. Many WebControls have built in adaptive rendering that will render different HTML based on the browser user agent. As an example a DataGrid will look quite different in a mobile browser than it will in a desktop browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using WebControls as opposed to HtmlControls also lets you take advantage of &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/67276kc5.aspx"&gt;ASP.NET v2.0 ControlAdapters&lt;/a&gt; which I believe only works with WebControls, this will allow you programatic config driven control over the markup that gets emitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might seem more valuable when you consider that certain mobile browsers or WebTVs are going to want WML or completely different sets of markups.&lt;/p&gt;

If you're primarily interested in composition, then use one of the other usual IoC suspects. If, on the otherhand, you are primarily concerned with extensibility, then the introduction of catalogs, parts, metadata tagging, duck typing, and delayed loading all make for some interesting possibilities.

The problem primarily occurs because the build that the developers do on their local machines is fundamentally different from the build that occurs on the build machine. The devs are building the projects using FlexBuilder/eclipse and the build machine is using the command line compilers. Inevitably, the {projectname}-config.xml and/or the batch file that runs the build get out of sync with the project files used by eclipse, so the the build succeeds on the dev's machine, but fails on the build machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started down the path of writing a utility program to convert FlexBuilder's project files into a {projectname}-config.xml file, but it's a) undocumented and b) a horrible hack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've looked into the -dump-config switch to get the config files, but this has a couple of problems: 1) The generated config file has absolute paths which doesn't work in our environment (some developers use macs, some windows machines), and 2) only works right when run from the IDE, so can't be build into the build process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, we are going to discuss a couple of options, neither of which I'm terribly fond of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) add a post check-in event to Subversion to remove these absolute references, or
b) add a pre-build process that removes the absolute reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set up a small threadpool with N threads in it and have one thread to control them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The master thread simply sits in a loop doing something like:&lt;/p&gt;

The nearest thing I can think is that we could at least share some settings between sites on the same machine by putting them in a web.config higher in the directory hierarchy... but this too is not something I've been able to investigate... having thought it more important to understand which of the strong or weak-typed routes is 'better'.&lt;/p&gt;

Typically you will have a "Version.txt" in your source tree and the MSBuild task will increment the "Release" number while the developers control the Major.Minor.Release.Revision numbers (that's how a client of mine wanted it).  You can use revision if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You then would have a "FileUpdate" tasks to edit the AssemblyInfo.cs file with that version, and your EXE's and "DLL's" will have the desired version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally the VSSLabel task will label all your files appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your "Rebuild" Build - you would modify your "Get" to get files from that Label, obviously not execute the "Version" task (as you are SELECTING a version to build) and then the FileUpdate tasks would use that version number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonus question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all "how you want to use them" - I would use build number for, well the build number, that is what I'd increment.  If you are using CI you'll have very many builds - the vast majority with no intention of ever deploying anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major and minor are self evident - but revision I've always used for a "Hotfix" indicator.  I intend to have a "1.3" release - which would in reality be a product with say 1.3.1234.0 version.  While working on 1.4 - I find a bug - and need a hot fix as 1.3.2400.1.

&lt;p&gt;/Classes/User.cs
/Classes/Post.cs
...
/Users.cs
/Posts.cs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the classes folder had just the class i.e. properties and getters/setters.
The Users.cs, Post.cs, etc. have the actual methods that access the Data Access Layer, so Posts.cs might look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class Posts
{
    public static Post GetPostByID(int postID)
    {
          SqlDataProvider dp = new SqlDataProvider();

    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another more traditional route would be to put all of the methods in Posts.cs into the class definition also (Post.cs).&lt;/p&gt;

Why not simply turn of AutoUpdates in the first place? if you don't even want the OS to tell you it would like to reboot, then how can you know that you need to, y'know, reboot?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patches which call for a reboot &lt;strong&gt;are not fully active until that reboot is complete&lt;/strong&gt;; thus your system remains vulnerable to the unpatched behaviour.

&lt;p&gt;As a disclaimer I should add that I'm quite new to C but not exactly a newbie, so there might be bugs, or bad coding practices, please do correct me (and my grammar sucks too).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally didn't know about it until I came upon &lt;a href="http://www.imperialviolet.org/page25.html#e498"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by Adam Langley, I shall give a few code snippets to illustrate the usage of it and clarify some things that might not be that clear on first use. The benefits of using this is that you get back data readily usable in &lt;em&gt;socket()&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;listen()&lt;/em&gt; and other functions, and if done right you won't have to worry about ipv4/v6 either.&lt;br&gt;
So to start off with the basics, as taken from the link above (you will need to link against libanl (-lanl)) :&lt;br&gt;
Here is the function prototype:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int getaddrinfo_a(int mode, struct gaicb *list[], int ent, 
                  struct sigevent *);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;mode&lt;/em&gt; is either GAI_WAIT (which is probably not what you want) and GAI_NOWAIT for async lookups &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;gaicb&lt;/em&gt; argument accepts an array of hosts to lookup with the &lt;em&gt;ent&lt;/em&gt; argument specifying how many elements the array has&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;sigevent&lt;/em&gt; will be responsible for telling the function how we are to be notified, more on this in a moment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A gaicb struct looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;struct gaicb {
    const char *ar_name;
    const char *ar_service;
    const struct addrinfo *ar_request;
    struct addrinfo *ar_result;
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're familiar with getaddrinfo, then these fields correspond to them like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int getaddrinfo(const char *node, const char *service,
                const struct addrinfo *hints,
                struct addrinfo **res);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The node is the ar_name field, service is the port, the hints argument corresponds to the ar_request member and the result is stored in the rest.&lt;br&gt;
Now you specify how you want to be notified through the sigevent structure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;struct sigevent {
    sigval_t sigev_value;
    int sigev_signo;
    int sigev_notify;
    void (*sigev_notify_function) (sigval_t);
    pthread_addr_t *sigev_notify_attributes;
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can ignore the notification via setting _sigev_notify_ to SIGEV_NONE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can trigger a signal via setting sigev_notify to SIGEV_SIGNAL and sigev_signo to the desired signal. Note that when using a real-time signal (&lt;em&gt;SIGRTMIN&lt;/em&gt;-*SIGRTMAX*, always use it via the macros and addition &lt;em&gt;SIGRTMIN&lt;/em&gt;+2 etc.) you can pass along a pointer or value in the sigev_value.sival_ptr or sigev_value.sival_int member respectivley&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can request a callback in a new thread via setting sigev_notify to SIGEV_NONE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically if you want to look up a hostname you set ar_name to the host and set everything else to &lt;em&gt;NULL&lt;/em&gt;, if you want to connect to a host you set ar_name and ar_service , and if you want to create a server you specify ar_service and the ar_result field. You can of course customize the ar_request member to your hearts content, look at &lt;a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man3/getaddrinfo.3.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;man getaddrinfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for more info.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an event loop with select/poll/epoll/kqueue you might want to use &lt;a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man2/signalfd.2.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;signalfd&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for convenience. Signalfd creates a file descriptor on which you can use the usuall event polling mechanisms like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#define _GNU_SOURCE //yes this will not be so standardish
#include &amp;lt;netdb.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;signal.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;sys/signalfd.h&amp;gt;

void signalfd_setup(void) {
    int sfd;
    sigset_t mask;

    sigemptyset(&amp;amp;mask);
    sigaddset(&amp;amp;mask, SIGRTMIN);
    sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &amp;amp;mask, NULL); //we block the signal
    sfd = signalfd(-1, &amp;amp;mask, 0);
    //add it to the event queue
}
void signalfd_read(int fd) {
    ssize_t s;
    struct signalfd_siginfo fdsi;
    struct gaicb *host;

    while((s = read(fd, &amp;amp;fdsi, sizeof(struct signalfd_siginfo))) &amp;gt; 0){
    if (s != sizeof(struct signalfd_siginfo)) return; //thats bad
    host = fdsi.ssi_ptr; //the pointer passed to the sigevent structure
            //the result is in the host-&amp;gt;ar_result member
            create_server(host);
    }
}
void create_server(struct gaicb *host) {
    struct addrinfo *rp, *result;
    int fd;

    result = host-&amp;gt;ar_result;
    for(rp = result; rp != NULL; rp = rp-&amp;gt;ai_next) {
        fd = socket(rp-&amp;gt;ai_family, rp-&amp;gt;ai_socktype, rp-&amp;gt;ai_protocol);
        bind(fd, rp-&amp;gt;ai_addr, rp-&amp;gt;ai_addrlen);
        listen(fd, SOMAXCONN);
        //error checks are missing!

        freeaddrinfo(host-&amp;gt;ar_request);
        freeaddrinfo(result);
        //you should free everything you put into the gaicb
    }
}
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    struct gaicb *host;
    struct addrinfo *hints;
    struct sigevent sig;

    host = calloc(1, sizeof(struct gaicb));
    hints = calloc(1, sizeof(struct addrinfo));

    hints-&amp;gt;ai_family = AF_UNSPEC; //we dont care if its v4 or v6
    hints-&amp;gt;ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;
    hints-&amp;gt;ai_flags = AI_PASSIVE;
    //every other field is NULL-d by calloc

    host-&amp;gt;ar_service = "8888"; //the port we will listen on
    host-&amp;gt;ar_request = hints;

    sig.sigev_notify = SIGEV_SIGNAL;
    sig.sigev_value.sival_ptr = host;
    sig.sigev_signo = SIGRTMIN;

    getaddrinfo_a(GAI_NOWAIT, &amp;amp;host, 1, &amp;amp;sig);

    signalfd_setup();

    //start your event loop
    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can of course use a simple signal handler for this job too, look at &lt;a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man2/sigaction.2.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;man sigaction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for more info.&lt;/p&gt;

Spring and Hibernate are the logical choice if you're looking for a 'free' solution, but they have their own quirks, and there's notable blood under the bridge when it comes to Hibernate's transaction management vs Spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, ATG has an number of features that Spring and Hibernate are still catching up to.  Nucleus offers container and environment support well beyond anything Spring does. Spring's support for session scoping was added as a direct response to ATG's session and request scoped components.  Hibernate only supports a single repository at a time, has noticably poorer monitoring, and features like distributed caching across servers are completely beyond Hibernate.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unit testing is a mixed bag.  You can mock most things with interfaces, but for stuff like droplets, you have to use EasyMock with the class extension, or jMockit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This requires going once through the list brokers. However if the list of brokers is fixed or doesn't change that often you can keep an array of cumulative sums, i.e. A[i] is the sum of weights of all brokers 0,..,i-1. Then A[n] is the total weight and if you pick a number between 1 and A[n-1], say x you find the broker j s.t. A[j-1] &amp;lt;= x &amp;lt; A[j]. For convenience you let A[0] = 0. You can find this broker number j in log(n) steps using binary search, I'll leave the code as an easy exercise. If your data changes frequently this might not be a good way to go since every time some weight changes you might need to update a large portion of the array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, when you open a cursor, you are basically loading those rows into memory and locking them, creating potential blocks. Then, as you cycle through the cursor, you are making changes to other tables and still keeping all of the memory and locks of the cursor open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several types of cursors (forward-only, static, keyset, dynamic). Each one has different performance characteristics and associated overhead.  Make sure you use the correct cursor type for your operation.  Forward-only is the default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One argument for using a cursor is when you need to process and update individual rows, especially for a dataset that doesn't have a good unique key.  In that case you can use the FOR UPDATE clause when declaring the cursor and process updates with UPDATE ... WHERE CURRENT OF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JDBC calls directly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DAO + POJO without relations between Pojos (basically wrapping the JDBC). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added Relations between POJOs implementing Lazy Loading, but just hiding the inter-DAO calls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jumped onto the Hibernate bandwagon after seeing how "simple" it made data access (it made inter POJO relations trivial) and because it could decrease the number of round trips to the database when working with many related entities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since it was a desktop application keeping Sessions open long term was a nightmare so it ended up causing a whole lot of issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stepped back to a partial DAO/Hibernate approach that allows me to make direct JDBC calls behind the DAO curtain while at the same time using Hibernate.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So difference between &lt;strong&gt;override&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;reintroduce&lt;/strong&gt; is in polymorphism.  With &lt;strong&gt;reintroduce&lt;/strong&gt;, if you cast the descendant object as the parent type, then call that method you will get the ancestor method, but if you access it the descendant type then you will get the behavior of the descendant.  With &lt;strong&gt;override&lt;/strong&gt; you always get the descendant. If the ancestor method was neither &lt;strong&gt;virtual&lt;/strong&gt; nor &lt;strong&gt;dynamic&lt;/strong&gt;, then &lt;strong&gt;reintroduce&lt;/strong&gt; does not apply because that behavior is implicit. (Actually you could use a class helper, but we won't go there now.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spite of what Malach said, you &lt;em&gt;can still call &lt;strong&gt;inherited&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in a reintroduced method, even if the parent was neither &lt;strong&gt;virtual&lt;/strong&gt; nor &lt;strong&gt;dynamic&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially reintroduce is just like &lt;strong&gt;override&lt;/strong&gt;, but it works with non-&lt;strong&gt;dynamic&lt;/strong&gt; and non-&lt;strong&gt;virtual&lt;/strong&gt; methods, and it &lt;em&gt;does not replace&lt;/em&gt; the behavior if the object instance is accessed via an expression of the ancestor type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further Explanation:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reintroduce&lt;/strong&gt; is a way of communicating intent to the compiler that you did not make an error.  We override a method in an ancestor with the &lt;strong&gt;override&lt;/strong&gt; keyword, but it requires that the ancestor method be &lt;strong&gt;virtual&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;dynamic&lt;/strong&gt;, and that you want the behavior to change when the object is accessed as the ancestor class.  Now enter &lt;strong&gt;reintroduce&lt;/strong&gt;.  It lets you tell the compiler that you did not accidentally create a method with the same name as a virtual or dynamic ancestor method (which would be annoying if the compiler didn't warn you about).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's my solution and it does what i expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;cat.hh&lt;/em&gt; : &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;string&amp;gt;

class Cat
{
    std::string _name;
public:
    Cat(const std::string &amp;amp; name);
    void speak();
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;cat.cpp&lt;/em&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;string&amp;gt;

#include "cat.hh"

using namespace std;

Cat::Cat(const string &amp;amp; name):_name(name){}
void Cat::speak()
{
    cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; "Meow! I'm " &amp;lt;&amp;lt; _name &amp;lt;&amp;lt; endl;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;main.cpp&lt;/em&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;string&amp;gt;
#include "cat.hh"

using std::cout;using std::endl;using std::string;
int main()
{
    string name = "Felix";
    cout&amp;lt;&amp;lt; "Meet my cat, " &amp;lt;&amp;lt; name &amp;lt;&amp;lt; "!" &amp;lt;&amp;lt;endl;
    Cat kitty(name);
    kitty.speak();
    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compilation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You compile the shared lib first:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ g++ -Wall -g -fPIC -c cat.cpp
$ g++ -shared -Wl,-soname,libcat.so.1 -o libcat.so.1 cat.o
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then compile the main executable or C++ program using the classes in the libraries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ g++ -Wall -g -c main.cpp
$ g++ -Wall -Wl,-rpath,. -o main main.o libcat.so.1 # -rpath linker option prevents the need to use LD_LIBRARY_PATH when testing
$ ./main
Meet my cat, Felix!
Meow! I'm Felix
$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with, let's look at why &lt;code&gt;LIKE&lt;/code&gt; may not be the most effective search. When you use &lt;code&gt;LIKE&lt;/code&gt;, especially when you are searching with a % at the beginning of your comparison, SQL Server needs to perform both a table scan of every single row &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a byte byte by byte check of the column you are checking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FTS has some better algorithms for matching data as does some better statistics on variations of names. Therefore FTS can provide better performance for matching Smith, Smythe, Smithers, etc when you look for Smith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, however, a bit more complex to use FTS, as you'll need to master &lt;code&gt;CONTAINS&lt;/code&gt; vs &lt;code&gt;FREETEXT&lt;/code&gt; and the arcane format of the search. However, if you want to do a search where either FName or LName match, you can do that with one statement instead of an OR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To determine if FTS is going to be effective, determine how much data you have. I use FTS on a database of several hundred million rows and that's a real benefit over searching with &lt;code&gt;LIKE&lt;/code&gt;, but I don't use it on every table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your table size is more reasonable, less than a few million, you can get similar speed by creating an index for each column that you're going to be searching on and SQL Server should perform an index scan rather than a table scan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The .NET framework also supports events and semaphores via classes in the System.Threading namespace.

Events are easier to use than their Win32 counterparts, mainly because the "auto reset" and "manual reset" flavors are expressed in different classes (aptly named AutoResetEvent and ManualResetEvent, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;

The first set of calls is preparing/opening the cursor.  Then fetching rows from the cursor.  Finally closing the cursor.  Those sprocs are analogous to the OPEN CURSOR, FETCH NEXT, CLOSE CURSOR T-SQL statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd have to take a closer look (which I will), but my guess is there is something going on with the server-side cursor, the encapsulating transaction, and the DDL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some more questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you meaning to use server-side cursors in this case?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are the ADO Commands all using the same active connection?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not exactly sure what's going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like you're using server-side cursors so you can use Recordset.Update() to push changes back to the server, in addition to executing generated SQL statements to alter schema and update data in the dynamic table(s).

&lt;p&gt;So, using CLR procedures would firstly provide a much more familiar toolset to this type of developer, and secondly, the debugging and testing facilities are more powerful (ie Visual Studio instead of SQL Management Studio).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One approach I rather like is to create an iterator/generator object that emits instances of objects that are relevant to a specific context. Usually this object wraps some underlying database access stuff, but I don't need to know that when using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An AnswerIterator object generates AnswerIterator.Answer objects.  Under the hood it's iterating over a SQL Statement to fetch all the answers, and another SQL statement to fetch all related comments.  But when using the iterator I just use the Answer object that has the minimum properties for this context.  With a little bit of skeleton code this becomes almost trivial to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've found that this works well when I have a huge dataset to work on, and when done right, it gives me small, transient objects that are relatively easy to test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's basically a thin veneer over the Database Access stuff, but it still gives me the flexibility of abstracting it when I need to.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm  thinking about developing enterprise apps that predominantly use WinForms clients.  In this instance the business logic is contained on an application server.  Each client would need to know the phone number to dial, but placing it in the App.config of each client poses a problem if that phone number changes.  In that case it seems obvious to store application configuration information (or application wide settings) in a database and have each client read the settings from there.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other, .NET way, (I make the distinction because we have, in the pre .NET days, stored application settings in DB tables) is to store application settings in the app.config file and access via way of the generated Settings class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I digress.  Your situation sounds different.  If all different apps are on the same server, you could place the settings in a web.config at a higher level.  However if they are not, you could also have a seperate "configuration service" that all three applications talk to get their shared settings.  At least in this solution you're not replicating the code in three places, raising the potential of maintenance problems when adding settings.  Sounds a bit over engineered though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal preference is to use strong typed settings.  I actually generate my own strongly typed settings class based on what it's my settings table in the database.  That way I can have the best of both worlds.  Intellisense to my settings and settings stored in the db (note: that's in the case where there's no app server).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm interested in learning other peoples strategies for this too :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one is stopping you from choosing the framework/approach that you would wish. If you are going to go the "data driven/stored procedure-powered" path, then by all means, go for it! Especially if it really, really helps you deliver your applications on-spec and on-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The caveat being (a flipside to your question that is), ALL of your business rules should be on stored procedures, and your application is nothing more than a thin client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, same rules apply if you do your application in OOP : be consistent. Follow OOP's tenets, and &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; includes creating entity objects to represent your domain models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only real rule here is the word &lt;em&gt;consistency&lt;/em&gt;. Nobody is stopping you from going DB-centric. No one is stopping you from doing old-school structured (aka, functional/procedural) programs. Hell, no one is stopping anybody from doing COBOL-style code. BUT an application has to be very, very consistent once going down this path, if it wishes to attain any degree of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ls &amp;gt; `pwd`.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which will use the full pathname, which should be fine.
Note that if you do this in your home directory, which might
be in /home/hoboben, you will be trying the create /home/hoboben.txt,
a text file in the directory above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this what you wanted?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wanted the directory to contain a file named after it, you would get
the basename of the current directory and append that with .txt to the pwd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, rather than use the pwd command... why not use the PWD environment variable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ls &amp;gt; $PWD.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ls &amp;gt; ${PWD}/${PWD##*/}.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do this, the file will contain its own name, so most often, you would remedy this in one of a few ways.  You could redirect to somewhere else and move the file or name the file beginning with a dot to hide it from the ls command as long as you don't use the -a flag (and then optionally rename the resulting file).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I write my own scripts to manage a directory hierarchy of music files and I use subdirectories named ".info", for example, to contain track data in some spare files (basically, I "hide" metadata this way).  It works out okay because my needs are simple and my collection small.&lt;/p&gt;

I did try a lot of different things, from writing a vbs script as suggested to a standalone program called hstart. hstart worked...but it creates a separate process which I didn't like very much because then I can't kill it in the normal way. But I found a simpler solution that required simply Haskell code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My code from before was a simple call to runCommand, which did popup the window.

From peeking at the ghc source code file runProcess.c, I found that the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag is set when you supply redirects for all of STDIN, STOUT, and STDERR. So that's what you need to do, supply redirects for those. My test program looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import System.Process
import System.IO
main = do
  inH &amp;lt;- openFile "in" ReadMode
  outH &amp;lt;- openFile "out" WriteMode
  runProcess "rsync.bat" [] Nothing Nothing (Just inH) (Just outH) (Just outH)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This worked! No command window again! A caveat is that you need an empty file for inH to read in as the STDIN eventhough in my situation it was not needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually wrote another post on StackOverflow asking if there are other better approaches: &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/55963/unsafe-c-and-pointers-for-2d-rendering-good-or-bad"&gt;Unsafe C# and pointers for 2d rendering, good or bad?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is relatively high performance, it requires the unsafe compiler option as it uses pointers to access the memory efficiently.  Hence the reason for this earlier post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a high level of the required steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the DirectX SDK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new C# winforms project and reference the installed
Microsoft DirectX assembly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initialize a new DirectX Device object with Presentation Parameters
(windowed, back buffering etc) you
require.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create the Device, taking care to record the surface "Pitch" and
current display mode (bits per
pixel).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you need to display something, Lock the backbuffer
surface and store the returned
pointer to the start of surface
memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use pointer arithmetic, calculate the actual pixel position in the
data based on the surface pitch,
bits per pixel and the actual x/y
pixel coordinate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In my case for simplicity I am sticking to 32bpp, meaning setting a
pixel is as simple as:  *(surfacePointer + (y * pitch + x))=Color.FromARGB(255,0,0);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When finished drawing, Unlock the back buffer surface. Present the surface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat from step 5 as required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be aware that taking this approach you need to be very careful about checking the current display mode (pitch and bits per pxiel) of the target surface.  Also you will need to have a strategy in place to deal with window resizing or changes of screen format while your program is running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you forget the drive, it breaks, or is lost/stolen, then you can still sit down at a PC and program with no code missing if you're at the last PC you used, or very little code missing (which will be updated later with a resync anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it's just a hop skip and a jump away from simply using the network to move the changes between the systems if you don't want to carry the drive around later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this important?  Think about .NET 2.0, 3.0, and 3.5.  .NET 3.0 is basically .NET 2.0 with some extra assemblies, and 3.5 adds a few more assemblies.  So for instance, .NET 3.5 adds the &lt;code&gt;DataPager&lt;/code&gt; control, which is a web control and should be grouped in &lt;code&gt;System.Web.UI.WebControls&lt;/code&gt;.  If namespaces and physical locations were identical, it couldn't be because it's in a different assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So having namespaces as independent logical entities means you can have members of several different assemblies which are all logically grouped together because they're meant to be used in conjunction with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Also, there's nothing wrong with having your physical and logical layouts pretty similar.)&lt;/p&gt;

One of the things I like most is the strong typing that you can't get with a DataReader or a DataTable. Another reason is that when done well, proper entity classes can make the code more maintanable by using first-class constructs for domain-specific terms that anyone looking at the code is likely to understand rather than a bunch of strings with field names in them used for indexing a DataRow. Stored procedures are really orthogonal to the use of an ORM since a lot of mapping frameworks give you the ability to map to sprocs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't consider sprocs + datareaders a substitute for a good ORM. With stored procedures, you're still constrained by, and tightly-coupled to, the procedure's type signature, which uses a different type system than the calling code. Stored procedures can be subject to modification to acommodate additional options and schema changes. An alternative to stored procedures in the case where the schema is subject to change is to use views--you can map objects to views and then re-map views to the underlying tables when you change them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can understand your aversion to ORMs if your experience mainly consists of Java EE and CSLA. You might want to have a look at LINQ to SQL, which is a very lightweight framework and is primarily a one-to-one mapping with the database tables but usually only needs minor extension for them to be full-blown business objects. LINQ to SQL can also map input and output objects to stored procedures' paramaters and results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ADO.NET Entity framework has the added advantage that your database tables can be viewed as entity classes inheriting from each other, or as columns from multiple tables aggregated into a single entity. If you need to change the schema, you can change the mapping from the conceptual model to the storage schema without changing the actual application code. And again, stored procedures can be used here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that more IT projects in enterprises fail because of unmaintainability of the code or poor developer productivity (which can happen from, e.g., context switching between sproc-writing and app-writing) than scalability problems of an application.&lt;/p&gt;

Like others have mentioned, SQL is great for operations and modifications on &lt;em&gt;sets of data&lt;/em&gt;. Anybody who has done extensive large application development with complex business/domain rules would likely tell you - trying to enforce some of these rules using pure SQL (some times into a single macro query) can get truly nightmarish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are just certain tasks that are better handled in a procedural or OO fashion. By having the choice of using .NET code to break down the sequence of logic, query operations can get easier to read and debug. Having used CLR stored procs I can tell you stepping through with the debugger really makes it easier to follow through with what is happening at the database level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just one example, we frequently use CLR stored procs here as a "gateway" for dynamic search queries. Say a search request that can have up to 30 different search parameters. Users obviously don't use all 30 of them, so the data structure passed in will have 30 parameters but mostly DBNULL. The client side has &lt;em&gt;no option&lt;/em&gt; to generate a dynamic statement, for obvious security reasons. The resulting dynamic statement is generated internally without fear of external "extras".&lt;/p&gt;

Instead, if your application logic works on a 2-D matrix of data, fetching those via direct JDBC works better. Although Hibernate is written on top of JDBC, it has capabilities which might be non-trivial to implement in JDBC. For eg:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say, the user views a row in the UI and changes some of the values and you want to fire an update query for only those columns that did indeed change.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;To avoid getting into deadlocks you need to maintain a global order for SQLs in a transaction. Getting this right JDBC might not be easy&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Easily setting up optimistic locking. When you use JDBC, you need to remember to have this in every update query.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Batch updates, lazy materialization of collections etc might also be non-trivial to implement in JDBC.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I say "&lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; be non-trivial", because it of course can be done - and you might be a super hacker:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hibernate lets you fire your own SQL queries also, in case you need to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps you to decide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of TDD is to produce clean, testable code along with a suite of automated regression tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is amazing to me how clean the code can end up when you just go at it with TDD... you think up problems, write tests for it, implement to make the tests pass, then refactor to ensure the code is clean and readable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think you really NEED a lot of up front design with TDD, but it may help... I'm kind of with you on "design by coding", but at the same time you can maybe catch major flaws ahead of time if you think about it in a bigger picture, even if minimally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A better programming model.&lt;/strong&gt; The .NET Framework languages are in many respects richer than Transact-SQL, offering constructs and capabilities previously not available to SQL Server developers. Developers may also leverage the power of the .NET Framework Library, which provides an extensive set of classes that can be used to quickly and efficiently solve programming problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved safety and security.&lt;/strong&gt; Managed code runs in a common language run-time environment, hosted by the Database Engine. SQL Server leverages this to provide a safer and more secure alternative to the extended stored procedures available in earlier versions of SQL Server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ability to define data types and aggregate functions.&lt;/strong&gt; User defined types and user defined aggregates are two new managed database objects which expand the storage and querying capabilities of SQL Server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streamlined development through a standardized environment.&lt;/strong&gt; Database development is integrated into future releases of the Microsoft Visual Studio .NET development environment. Developers use the same tools for developing and debugging database objects and scripts as they use to write middle-tier or client-tier .NET Framework components and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential for improved performance and scalability.&lt;/strong&gt; In many situations, the .NET Framework language compilation and execution models deliver improved performance over Transact-SQL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of scaling &amp;amp; speed it actually seems to be better than struts, and my guess would be because there are less layers involved.

&lt;p&gt;I have a set of records. For this set of records I have connection data which indicates how pairs of records from this set connect to one another. This basically represents an undirected graph, with the records being the vertices and the connection data the edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the records in the set have connection information (i.e. no orphan records are present; each record in the set connects to one or more other records in the set).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to choose any two records from the set and be able to show all simple paths between the chosen records. By "simple paths" I mean the paths which do not have repeated records in the path (i.e. finite paths only).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: The two chosen records will always be different (i.e. start and end vertex will never be the same; no cycles).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    If I have the following records:
        A, B, C, D, E

    and the following represents the connections: 
        (A,B),(A,C),(B,A),(B,D),(B,E),(B,F),(C,A),(C,E),
        (C,F),(D,B),(E,C),(E,F),(F,B),(F,C),(F,E)

        [where (A,B) means record A connects to record B]
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I chose B as my starting record and E as my ending record, I would want to find all simple paths through the record connections that would connect record B to record E.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harder to maintain and Test:
VS provides full syntax checking, style checking, referential and constraint checking and more. It also provide full unit testing capabilities and refactoring tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LINQ makes true unit testing impossible as (in my mind) it fails the ACID test.&lt;/p&gt;

Why? VS allows full step-in from managed code and regular debugging of SPs.&lt;/p&gt;

Once again, VS comes to the rescue where it can build and deploy full databases or make data-safe incremental changes.&lt;/p&gt;

No you don't, but you have to learn LINQ - where's the benefit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I really don't see this as being a benefit. Being able to change something in isolation might sound good in theory, but just because the changes fulfil a contract doesn't mean it's returning the correct results. To be able to determine what the correct results are you need context and you get that context from the calling code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Um, loosely coupled apps are the ultimate goal of all good programmers as they really do increase flexibility. Being able to change things in isolation is fantastic, and it is your unit tests that will ensure it is still returning appropriate results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you all get upset, I think LINQ has its place and has a grand future. But for complex, data-intensive applications I do not think it is ready to take the place of stored procedures. This was a view I had echoed by an MVP at TechEd this year (they will remain nameless).&lt;/p&gt;

I've done this for quite a lot of our projects and it's a huge timesaver, not to mention that the code is less error prone, because you don't convert your java objects to anything and then back again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have linked my GWT with Rails before, using the to_json function in Rails and then reading the JSON in GWT. It's all supported, but it is far more annoying than just doing the back end in JAVA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used a 'breadth first' iterative search which used a queue of status' each of which held a record containing a current point on the graph and the path taken to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you start with a single record in the queue, which has the starting node and an empty path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each iteration through the code takes the item off the head of the list, and checks to see if it is a solution (the node arrived at is the one you want, if it is, we are done), otherwise, it constructs a new queue item with the nodes connecting to the current node, and amended paths that are based on the path of the previous node, with the new jump attached at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you could use something similar, but when you find a solution, instead of stopping, add that solution to your 'found list' and continue.&lt;/p&gt;

Both are in-memory caching solutions with dead-simple APIs and lots of libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trouble with those 2 is you need to install them on your web server or another server if it's Memcached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;APC&lt;/h2&gt;

Pros:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speeds up PHP execution also&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Cons

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doesn't work for distributed systems, each machine stores its cache locally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Memcached&lt;/h2&gt;

Pros:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast(ish)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be installed on a separate server for all web servers to use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly tested, developed at LiveJournal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Used by all the big guys (Facebook, Yahoo, Mozilla)&lt;/p&gt;

Cons:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slower than APC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possible network latency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slightly more configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't recommend writing your own, there are plenty out there. You could go with a disk-based cache if you can't install software on your webserver, but there are possible race issues to deal with. One request could be writing to the file while another is reading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You actually could cache search queries, even for a few seconds to a minute. Unless your db is being updated more than a few times a second, some delay would be ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;: Added code to determine the most recent active text box.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you can use each text box's onBlur event to set a variable to "this" so you always know the most recent active text box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, there's an IE way to get the cursor position that also works in Opera, and an easier way in Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In IE the basic concept is to use the document.selection object and &lt;em&gt;put&lt;/em&gt; some text &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; the selection. Then, using indexOf, you can get the position of the text you added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In FireFox, there's a method called selectionStart that will give you the cursor position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have the cursor position, you overwrite the whole text.value with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;text before the cursor position + the text you want to insert + the text after the cursor position&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example with separate links for IE and FireFox.  You can use you favorite browser detection method to figure out which code to run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;

var lasttext;

function doinsert_ie() {
    var oldtext = lasttext.value;
    var marker = "##MARKER##";
    lasttext.focus();
    var sel = document.selection.createRange();
    sel.text = marker;
    var tmptext = lasttext.value;
    var curpos = tmptext.indexOf(marker);
    pretext = oldtext.substring(0,curpos);
    posttest = oldtext.substring(curpos,oldtext.length);
    lasttext.value = pretext + "|" + posttest;
}

function doinsert_ff() {
    var oldtext = lasttext.value;
    var curpos = lasttext.selectionStart;
    pretext = oldtext.substring(0,curpos);
    posttest = oldtext.substring(curpos,oldtext.length);
    lasttext.value = pretext + "|" + posttest;
}

--&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;


&amp;lt;form name="testform"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;input type="text" name="testtext1" onBlur="lasttext=this;"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;input type="text" name="testtext2" onBlur="lasttext=this;"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;input type="text" name="testtext3" onBlur="lasttext=this;"&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;

  var _bar = List&amp;lt;GraphicsItem&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt;();

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;static GraphicsItem&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;[] CreateArrays&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;()
{
    GraphicsItem&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;[] _foo = new GraphicsItem&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;[1];

    // This can't work, because you don't know if T == typeof(string)
    // _foo[0] = (GraphicsItem&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;)new GraphicsItem&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;();

    // You can only create an array of the scoped type parameter T
    _foo[0] = new GraphicsItem&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;();

    List&amp;lt;GraphicsItem&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt; _bar = new List&amp;lt;GraphicsItem&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt;();

    // Again same reason as above

    // This works
    _bar.Add(new GraphicsItem&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;());

    return _bar.ToArray();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember you are going to need a generic type reference to create an array of a generic type. This can be either at method-level (using the T after the method) or at class-level (using the T after the class).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want the method to return an array of GraphicsItem and GraphicsItem, then let GraphicsItem inherit from a non-generic base class GraphicsItem and return an array of that. You will lose all type safety though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The solution for this situation is to have the Custom_AddDocLibMenuItems dynamically call a custom ASP.NET page. This page takes the ID of the document library and the specific item on the query string, and returns an XML string containing all the information for the commands available for that particular document. These commands are available according to the document's process status (or some other custom business logic). [...]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You just run the loop and only after the second time around the separator is set. So the first time it won't get added. It's not as clean as I'd like it to be so I'd still add comments but it's better than an if statement or adding the first or last item outside the loop.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Suppose you have a TextBox in a window, and a ToolBar with a Save button in it. Assume the TextBoxs Text property is bound to a property on a business object, and the bindings UpdateSourceTrigger property is set to the default value of LostFocus, meaning that the bound value is pushed back to the business object property when the TextBox loses input focus. Also, assume that the ToolBars Save button has its Command property set to ApplicationCommands.Save command. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;In that situation, if you edit the TextBox and click the Save button with the mouse, there is a problem. When clicking on a Button in a ToolBar, the TextBox does not lose focus. Since the TextBoxs LostFocus event does not fire, the Text property binding does not update the source property of the business object. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Obviously you should not validate and save an object if the most recently edited value in the UI has not yet been pushed into the object. This is the exact problem Karl had worked around, by writing code in his window that manually looked for a TextBox with focus and updated the source of the data binding. His solution worked fine, but it got me thinking about a generic solution that would also be useful outside of this particular scenario. Enter CommandGroup&lt;/p&gt;

Memory ought to be faster than disk, but main memory is faster than flash memory.  So if you read the same blocks from disk over and over, and the OS caches those blocks the first time around, subsequent reads will actually hit memory and not disk.  Flash drives would also gain from disk caching, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our code, I suspect (without being able to test it) that flash drives might not be a speed/price gain.  The algorithm uses massive lookup tables to avoid repeating expensive calculations, so we get a lot of IO waits.  One of our SAs discovered that if we queue up three related jobs at once, they can often run in just over the time it takes to run just one job.  The system disk cache cuts disk reads substantially if there is enough memory available.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since these tables rarely change, the write count limitation is not a huge concern, but the price is.  It sounds like there are applications that work well for this technology, but it isn't a silver bullet.&lt;/p&gt;

When you create a windows service in .Net, you create a class that inherits from System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase (In VB this is hidden in the .Designer.vb file). You then override the OnStart and OnStop function, and OnPause and OnContinue if you choose to. 
These methods are invoked from within the base class so I did a little poking around with reflector.
OnStart is invoked by a method in System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase called ServiceQueuedMainCallback.  The vesion on my machine "System.ServiceProcess, Version=2.0.0.0" decompiles like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
Private Sub ServiceQueuedMainCallback(ByVal state As Object)
    Dim args As String() = DirectCast(state, String())
    Try 
        Me.OnStart(args)
        Me.WriteEventLogEntry(Res.GetString("StartSuccessful"))
        Me.status.checkPoint = 0
        Me.status.waitHint = 0
        Me.status.currentState = 4
    Catch exception As Exception
        Me.WriteEventLogEntry(Res.GetString("StartFailed", New Object() { exception.ToString }), EventLogEntryType.Error)
        Me.status.currentState = 1
    Catch obj1 As Object
        Me.WriteEventLogEntry(Res.GetString("StartFailed", New Object() { String.Empty }), EventLogEntryType.Error)
        Me.status.currentState = 1
    End Try
    Me.startCompletedSignal.Set
End Sub
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So because Me.OnStart(args) is called from within the Try portion of a Try Catch block I assume that anything that happens within the OnStart method is effectively wrapped by that Try Catch block and therefore any exceptions that occur aren't technically unhandled as they are actually handled in the ServiceQueuedMainCallback Try Catch. So CurrentDomain.UnhandledException never actually happens at least during the startup routine. 
The other 3 entry points (OnStop, OnPause and OnContinue) are all called from the base class in a similar way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I think that explains why my Exception Handling component cant catch UnhandledException on Start and Stop, but Im not sure if it explains why timers that are setup in OnStart cant cause an UnhandledException when they fire. &lt;/p&gt;

The main reason would be because any time you call c = a + b; the underlying construct is usually c = (new StringBuilder()).append(a).append(b).toString();. By reusing the same string builder object, we can reduce the amount of allocations and garbage we produce. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other concern might be the &lt;b&gt;keyboard&lt;/b&gt; - you should definitely spend some time with both before you make a decision, as the keyboards on these 2 models are quite different beasts and each has it's strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it's worth noting that the product range traditionally gets 'refreshed' in October and you might find in 3-4 weeks time that you would get &lt;b&gt;more machine for your price point&lt;/b&gt; - well worth hanging-on for a little longer if you can, just to see what comes out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2005 I switched to Linux, initially as an experiment, but I never went back. There was a steep learning curve. I thought I knew *nix pretty well after 10 years of dealing with it, but I knew nothing compared with the amount I learned using it on my desktop machine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workflow has been so much smoother developing and deploying to similar platforms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, we have even started to pick servers running Ubuntu server, so that they most closely match our Ubuntu desktop development machines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are talking about the difference between a desktop and a server edition, I'd guess you needn't worry about it. If you're developing on one OS for deployment on another, I'd consider changing your desktop platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;foo = ["goo", "baz"]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I get the name of the array (here, "foo") back? If it is indeed possible, does this work on any variable (e.g., scalars, hashes, etc.)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Here's what I'm basically trying to do. I'm writing a SOAP server that wraps around a class with three important variables, and the validation code is essentially this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  [foo, goo, bar].each { |param|
      if param.class != Array
        puts "param_name wasn't an Array. It was a/an #{param.class}"
        return "Error: param_name wasn't an Array"
      end
      }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is then: Can I replace the instances of 'param_name' with foo, goo, or bar?

&lt;p&gt;First off it depends what style of design you buy into, because remember this is about design first.  As Martin Fowler discusses in this excellent article &lt;a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mocks Aren't Stubs&lt;/a&gt; there are two school of thoughts and they do produce different types of designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to buy into the mockist approach then I highly suggest you start by looking at the &lt;a href="http://mockobjects.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;mockobjects site&lt;/a&gt; and their article &lt;a href="http://www.mockobjects.com/book/index.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mock Roles, Not Objects&lt;/a&gt;. They also have a &lt;a href="http://www.mockobjects.com/book/index.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; coming out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is even if you do believe that the mock-first style of design is not for you, or that you don't want to do it right through your application (e.g. not when testing your domain/service layer) then you will still want to use test doubles. &lt;a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;xUnit Test Patterns&lt;/a&gt; explains the different types of test doubles and their purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I never mock domain classes, so never &lt;a href="http://jbrains.ca/permalink/90" rel="nofollow"&gt;mocking entities/value objects&lt;/a&gt;. However I've been trying out the mock objects style approach a lot recently, it does change my designs a bit and I find the working style comfortable. Working in this style in an MVC app I'll probably start with an automated acceptance test, then I'll write a controller test that mocks out any non-domain objects (e.g. repositories/services), then I'll move down to testing those repositories/services again mocking out their dependencies. I stop when I reach a class with no troublesome dependencies such as a domain entities/value object. I could go on and test against specific role interfaces which are then implemented by my domain classes, which is what the mockobjects guys would recommend, but I don't currently see a lot of value in that approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously it is worth adding that design for test is important here, but remember that although 90% of IoC/mocking/DIP examples show &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/InterfaceImplementationPair.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;interface-implementation pairs&lt;/a&gt; (ICustomerRepository/CustomerRepository) there is a lot of value in instead looking for &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/RoleInterface.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;role interfaces&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing helps your google rank more than having &lt;strong&gt;content&lt;/strong&gt; or offering a service people are interested in. If your web site is better than the competition and solves a real need you will naturally generate more traffic and inbound links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Keep your content fresh&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Use friendly url's that contain keywords&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://cars.com/products/cars/ford/focus/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://cars.com/products/cars/ford/focus/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Make sure the page title is relevant and well constructed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For example&lt;/strong&gt;: Buy A House In France :. Property Purchasing in France&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Use a domain name that describes your site&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://cars.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://cars.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://somerandomunrelateddomainname.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://somerandomunrelateddomainname.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;
Type car into Google, out of the top 5 links all 4 have car in the domain: &lt;a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=car" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=car&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Make it accessible&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure people can read your content. This includes a variety of different audiences&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with disabilities: Sight, motor, cognitive disabilities etc..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Search bots&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular make sure search bots can read every single relevant page on your site. Quite often search bots get blocked by the use of &lt;strong&gt;javascript&lt;/strong&gt; to link between pages or the use of frames / &lt;strong&gt;flash&lt;/strong&gt; / &lt;strong&gt;silverlight&lt;/strong&gt;. One easy way to do this is have a site map page that gives access to the whole site, dividing it into categories / sub categories etc..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Down level browsers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Submit your site map automatically&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most search engines allow you to submit a list of pages on your site including when they were last updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google: &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/docs/en/about.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/docs/en/about.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Inbound links&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generate as much buzz about your website as possible, to increase the likely hood of people linking to you. Blog / podcast about your website if appropriate. List it in online directories (if appropriate).&lt;/p&gt;

I need this so all the original numbers can all be multiplied out to the same scale and be processed by a sealed system that will only deal with whole numbers, then I can retrieve the results and divide them by the common multiplier to get my relative results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently we do a few checks on the numbers and multiply by 100 or 1,000,000, but the processing done by the *sealed system can get quite expensive when dealing with large numbers so multiplying everything by a million just for the sake of it isnt really a great option. As an approximation lets say that the sealed algorithm gets 10 times more expensive every time you multiply by a factor of 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the most efficient algorithm, that will also give the best possible result, to accomplish what I need and is there a mathematical name and/or formula for what Im need?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*The sealed system isnt really sealed. I own/maintain the source code for it but its 100,000 odd lines of proprietary magic and it has been thoroughly bug and performance tested, altering it to deal with floats is not an option for many reasons. It is a system that creates a grid of X by Y cells, then rects that are X by Y are dropped into the grid, proprietary magic occurs and results are spat out  obviously this is an extremely simplified version of reality, but its a good enough approximation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far there are quiet a few good answers and I wondered how I should go about choosing the correct one. To begin with I figured the only fair way was to create each solution and performance test it, but I later realised that pure speed wasnt the only relevant factor  an more accurate solution is also very relevant. I wrote the performance tests anyway, but currently the Im choosing the correct answer based on speed as well accuracy using a gut feel formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My performance tests process 1000 different sets of 100 randomly generated numbers. 
Each algorithm is tested using the same set of random numbers.
Algorithms are written in .Net 3.5 (although thus far would be 2.0 compatible)
I tried pretty hard to make the tests as fair as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really wanted the Decimal.GetBits solution to be the fastest, but it was very slow, Im unsure if this is due to the conversion of a Double to a Decimal or the Bit masking and shifting. There should be a 
similar usable solution for a straight Double using the BitConverter.GetBytes and some knowledge contained here: &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/bclteam/archive/2007/05/29/bcl-refresher-floating-point-types-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-inbar-gazit-matthew-greig.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://blogs.msdn.com/bclteam/archive/2007/05/29/bcl-refresher-floating-point-types-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-inbar-gazit-matthew-greig.aspx&lt;/a&gt; but my eyes just kept glazing over every time I read that article and I eventually ran out of time to try to implement a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hyper-V allows you to get great performance out of any .VHD VM that you run. Both Virtual PC and Virtual Server are free (as in beer) and you can set up a ton of infrastructure that allows you to re-purpose virtual machines (ie. Base Machines, Differencing Disks, Undo Disks). The .VHDs are also interchangeable so you can re-host a previously enjoyed .VHD for other developers to enjoy on some virtual server, OR they can take a copy of it, rename the virtual machine and enjoy your ready-to-go environment with some Virtual PC!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is awesome for bringing team members up to speed (environment wise) in less than 10 min. YOu can also use it to VERY QUICKLY provision machines that would otherwise take days to setup/configure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never mind the much better ability to test from different OS', or be able to roll back changes using Undo disks, VMs are a life saver! &lt;strong&gt;Start virtualizing people!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

While I don't have any solid performance statistics (because I haven't had any other method to compare it against) I know the string parsing would be relatively expensive and I figured a purely mathematical solution could potentially be more efficient.
To be fair the current string parsing solution is in production and there have been no complaints about its performance yet (its even in production in a separate system in a VB6 format and no complaints there either). It's just that it doesn't feel right, I guess it offends my programing sensibilities - but it may well be the best solution.&lt;/p&gt;

New UserPrivileges(SecurityRights.Read OR SecurityRights.Execute)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They effectively get combined (bit math) so that the above user has both Read AND Execute all carried around in one fancy SecurityRights variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To check to see if the user has a privilege you use AND (more bitwise math) to check the users enum value with the the Enum value you're checking for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;//Check to see if user has Write rights
If (user.Privileges And SecurityRights.Write = SecurityRigths.Write) Then
    //Do something clever...
Else
    //Tell user he can't write.
End If
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer by Flame is dangerously wrong. His WidgetHolder takes a reference to a value object in the constructor. As soon as the constructor returns, that passed-by-value object will be destroyed and so you'll hold a reference to a destroyed object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very simple sample app using his code clearly shows this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;

class Widget
{
    int x;
public:
    Widget(int inX) : x(inX){}
    ~Widget() {
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; "widget " &amp;lt;&amp;lt; static_cast&amp;lt; void*&amp;gt;(this) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; " destroyed" &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
     }
};

struct WidgetHolder
{
    Widget&amp;amp; A;

public:
    WidgetHolder(Widget a): A(a) {}

    const Widget&amp;amp; a() const {
 std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; "widget " &amp;lt;&amp;lt; static_cast&amp;lt; void*&amp;gt;(&amp;amp;A) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; " used" &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
 return A;
}

};

int main(char** argv, int argc)
{
Widget test(7);
WidgetHolder  holder(test);
Widget const &amp;amp; test2 = holder.a();

return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output would be something like &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
widget 0xbffff7f8 destroyed
widget 0xbffff7f8 used
widget 0xbffff7f4 destroyed
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid this the WidgetHolder constructor should take references to the variables it wants to store as references.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
struct WidgetHolder
{
    Widget&amp; A;

public:
    WidgetHolder(Widget &amp; a): A(a) {}

  /* ... */

};
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy: just set &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;100%&lt;/code&gt;! Except, it doesn't work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did find out about setting &lt;code&gt;frameborder&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it at least &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; like part of the site, but I'd prefer not to have an ugly scrollbar &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; a page that allready has one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know of any tricks to do this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; I think I need to clarify my question somewhat:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the company CMS displays the fluff and stuff for our whole website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most pages created through the CMS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my application isn't, but they will let me embedd it in an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have no control over the &lt;code&gt;iframe&lt;/code&gt;, so any solution must work from the referenced page (according to the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; attribute of the &lt;code&gt;iframe&lt;/code&gt; tag)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the CMS displays a footer, so setting the height to 1 million pixels is not a good idea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can I access the parent pages DOM from the referenced page? This might help, but I can see some people might not want this to be possible...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technique seems to work (&lt;a href="http://bytes.com/forum/thread91876.html"&gt;gleaned&lt;/a&gt; from several sources, but inspired by the &lt;a href="http://brondsema.net/blog/index.php/2007/06/06/100_height_iframe"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; from the accepted answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parent document:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iframe id="MyIFRAME" name="MyIFRAME" 
    src="http://localhost/child.html"
    scrolling="auto" width="100%" frameborder="0"&amp;gt;
    no iframes supported...
&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In child:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- ... --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script type="text/javascript"&amp;gt;
    function resizeIframe() {

        var docHeight;
        if (typeof document.height != 'undefined') {
            docHeight = document.height;
        }
        else if (document.compatMode &amp;amp;&amp;amp; document.compatMode != 'BackCompat') {
            docHeight = document.documentElement.scrollHeight;
        }
        else if (document.body 
            &amp;amp;&amp;amp; typeof document.body.scrollHeight != 'undefined') {
            docHeight = document.body.scrollHeight;
        }

        // magic number: suppress generation of scrollbars...
        docHeight += 20;

        parent.document.getElementById('MyIFRAME').style.height = docHeight + "px";    
    }
    parent.document.getElementById('MyIFRAME').onload = resizeIframe;
    parent.window.onresize = resizeIframe;
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;               
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BTW:&lt;/strong&gt; This will only work if parent and child are in the same domain due to a restriction in JavaScript for security reasons...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple example would be to workout what tomorrows date would be. You can do that by simply adding 1, to the day value in mktime() as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$tomorrow = date("Y-m-d", mktime(0, 0, 0, date("m"), date("d") + 1, date("Y")));&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some information about our planned usage of the system:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The server is going to host 4 or 5 instances of a Linux/Apache/MySQL/J2EE stack. Each of those instances will contain a mysql database with no more than 4 GB of data. Some of these instances are being used for mirroring the setup of our customers servers to be able to reproduce problems they're reporting, so these instances are probably idle most of the time (if they're started up at all). Some other instances are going to be used for testing purposes and we're going to restart them quite often, so startup time of our JBoss-Applicationserver (which is mainly CPU-bound) is gonna be very important.
Another contstraint is the amount of memory that our instances need, which is about 1.5 GB for JBoss and 500 MB for mysql.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clarify my question a little bit: I can of course do the math to calculate the amount of RAM and disk space I need to run 5 instances given the constraints stated above. I'm particularly interested in topics that are important for the interplay of XEN and the hardware (if there are any) because my experience with XEN is very limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Budget ist about 10,000 $ (just to provide some idea of what kind of hardware we can even consider).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;MIME type detection, or "data sniffing," refers to the process of determining an appropriate MIME type from binary data. The final result depends on a combination of server-supplied MIME type headers, file extension, and/or the data itself. Usually, only the first 256 bytes of data are significant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, read the first (up to) 256 bytes from the file and pass it to &lt;code&gt;FindMimeFromData&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

any required resources, files, etc.
Keep a good folder structure for
each project so developers can
"reference" the files directly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a repository for final buidls

product, the real version for
integration testing and so on.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In every generation ... you'll find people eager to adopt the latest metodology out there and use it. I'm an early tester, meaning I usually test every new thing that comes out but ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About TDD, really, why the hell should I write a Test before even writing the code? The purpose of a test is ... well, to test something, you don't code a test for something that maybe doesn't need a coded test. Maybe if you do you'll run out of time (there are project schedules you know), maybe the test itself is so complex you'll need to verify it in order to prove it's correct. We work in order to live, not the opposite, and we code some test in order to &lt;strong&gt;test&lt;/strong&gt; some pieces of code, not the opposite. Also, remember this is bussiness, there have to be a return rate,the profit of making something perfect but not getting paid is zero, no matter how good it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About designing by coding. Seriously, this works for every aspect in life, &lt;strong&gt;think before you do&lt;/strong&gt; (and &lt;strong&gt;think before you speak&lt;/strong&gt;). What's wrong with thinking in the design before doing it? Get a pen and a piece of paper and sketch your design, plan some classes, try to imagina WHAT it will do first, the PARTS of the system second, and HOW WILL THEY BE RELATED last. Then you can start thinking about how exactly is it gonna be implemented. What sense does it make to start coding without thinking about what you're doing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can't think about the design over a piece of paper, if you can only think about the code you're gonna write then, sorry you are not the appropiate person to architect the system but &lt;strong&gt;don't start coding before having the design&lt;/strong&gt;. Code is a living entity, and so is design, meaning &lt;strong&gt;they are suppose to evolve and adapt during the development process&lt;/strong&gt; but they are not supposed to be taken lightly or be rushed into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; I know I'm hard on TDD, I'm sorry and I'm willing to listen to experiences but I'm still looking to find one use of TDD over a large project (let's say more than 7000 work hours) which has worked using TDD. I mean, real project with precise dates and money involved.&lt;/p&gt;

I would like to fine tune that value for each thread to something smaller to reduce my application's memory usage.

OS X and Linux obviously make Apache-based apps a little easier by coming with Apache pre-installed, but a download of XAMPP or WAMPP can quickly turn a Windows box into a solid development platform for LAMP applications, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you're doing ASP.NET, your development tools (if you're using something in the Visual Studio line) have test server mechanisms built in.&lt;/p&gt;

I urge you to think the design through so that the class under test and the test can have a known behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, to be useful with an example, you could always do it like this (&lt;strong&gt;but don't&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[TestFixture]
public class MyTest {

    // The mocked interface
    public class MockedInterface implements MyInterface {
       int counter = 0;
       public method1() { counter++; }
       public method2() { counter++; }
       public method3() { counter++; }
    }

    // The actual test, I assume you have the ClassUnderTest
    // inject the interface through the constructor and
    // the methodToTest calls either of the three methods on 
    // the interface.
    [TestMethod]
    public void testCallingAnyOfTheThreeMethods() {
        MockedInterface mockery = new MockedInterface();
        ClassUnderTest classToTest = new ClassUnderTest(mockery);

        classToTest.methodToTest();

        Assert.That(mockery.counter, Is.GreaterThan(1));
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Somebody check my code, I've written this from my head now and haven't written a C# stuff for about a year now)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm interested to know why you're doing this though.&lt;/p&gt;

I looked into this for a project where I wanted to use SOAP. They all assume client asks server, server responds and that's it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the solution was the RemObjects SDK. This allows you to send notifications to clients, and the notification can have any data you like (just like the client to server). Myself I use the SuperTCP connection, but it works with others too. It can still offer a SOAP interface for clients that must use it, but for where you have control of both client and server it works extremely well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@public static: Your statement is spot on regarding the problems of designing up-ahead... Even if you're one of those amazingly smart people - the creme de la creme of geniuses - you can't design a whole system up front. You might think you can, but you're fooling yourself. The source of this problem is that, like they say, "God is in the details". The idea of nailing an appropriate design up front is pure hubris. But... That doesn't mean we shouldn't put anytime into designing up-front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets see what's our purpose in "designing" a system is anyway:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, we need a framework to think in. Have you ever tried to start a new project? The hardest part is writing the first line. Why? Because you have a writer's block - you have no idea where you're getting at. For example, lets say you want to write a computer game, lets call it "NotSoFarShout", which will be the next super-cool first-person-shooter that will conquer the world and make you rich for all eternity. Let's design by coding...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll start with our program's "main" function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void main(){
   // Um, what the h*** should I put in "main"?!
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So maybe designing by coding wasn't the right decision. Let's try a different way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are planning to write a first-person-shooter. What is a first person shooter anyway? OK, roughly speaking, it's a 3-D world where there's a player character, NPCs (Non-player-characters, like bad people, good people, monsters, gerbils etc), objects (trees, buildings, cars). The world is viewed from the player character's point of view. The player character can obtain all sorts of objects like weapons, ammo, health-packs etc. There are a gazillion other things that describe a first person shooter, but lets move on for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know a first person shooter takes a long time to develop - definitely more than a week or two. How would I even begin? I start little, and incrementally write and design the system. So I choose a small, attainable, short-term goal that I can grasp conceptually and actually think on how I will implement - for example, I'll start with the visualization of a 3-D world. I know there are a few good 3-D engines out there, I'll do a little research, pick one, and make it show my world, which is currently made out of a single sphere floating in a void. This is something that shouldn't take more than a week or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, done. Didn't take me two weeks - it took me three instead, but now I have something to build on. Next thing I might decide I want to build a single scene - static for now, nothing moves, no AI, no special meaning objects, people etc. Now comes the design part... As I start to think about depicting a scene, different aspects of the 3-D world would come into my mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My scene depicts two people standing in the desert, one of them is completely sun-burnt, the other is wearing a suit and a hat and holding a gun in his hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Question 1: How do I describe the content of the scene? The 3-D engine needs a specific representation in order to render the scene. Is it intuitive and easy to work with? If I want to change the scene and move the gun to the other hand of the character, how hard is it? What if I want to move it to the other character? What if I want to add a third person - how hard is it? What if I want to add 100 people in random locations in the scene, each of them randomly possessing a gun and/or a hat?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Question 2: What if I want the skin color of the character to change over time? For example, one of the characters is sun-burnt. If the other one stays in this desert scene long enough, I want her to gradually get sun-burnt as well?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Question 3: The sun is shining in the scene, but I want that to change over time - let's say each minute is real time is equivalent to 1 hour in the game, so I want the sun to move over the sky and for the scene to gradually turn into night, with or without a moon. Maybe I want the moon to go through its phases as days and nights go by. How would I represent that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of this lengthy example is to outline these issues with design:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are multiple levels of design. At the beginning of writing a product/subsystem/very-large-module you can usually only perform very High-level design. That is, you can define basic large entities like in our example: 3-D engine, storage, Networking, etc. This is important so you can choose where you want to start, where you think the biggest risks will be and suchlike. Note that later on in the process, that initial high level design will not only be broken into smaller, finer details, but most chances are you'll find it has flaws and it will change to accommodate the needs of the product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you've chosen a manageable piece you want to work on, you might have to create a detailed design of that piece. This is where designing by coding usually comes into play. You know you want to render a 3-D world, but you have no idea of what it takes. So you write a prototype to render a single 3-D scene. Then you create a single static scene. Then you look at what you have and think - "OK, what next? What do I need to make this useful for a FPS game? I'll need to render a lot of different scenes. OK, it took a lot of "describe" the current scene in code, how could I make it easier to make variations on the current scene? To create a whole new scene? How would I store scene descriptions? Graphic files? Sound files?...". This is the manifestation of what someone here said before (quoting the XP way of programming) - you write &lt;strong&gt;what you have to&lt;/strong&gt; instead of writing a generic and complex framework up front, but once you have to write the same code again with some variation (rendering a second scene, making variations on the current scene etc.), that's when you generalize and enhance the framework. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't be afraid to write throw-away prototypes that will highlight the different aspects you need to consider in your design. That way you have a concrete implementation on which to base your thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, quoting some one here - don't freeze your design! It's just plain stupid - if you realize you made a mistake in your design, refactor to change it. Just make sure not to make the mistake of throwing away everything and starting from scratch. Making incremental changes through refactoring usually works much better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but most important - I'm not presenting anything special or revolutionary here - all these ideas have been outlined by other people in the industry, much smarter and more experienced than me. I recommend you read a little about "Extreme programming", Scrum and other agile methodologies, as well as general books on the subject like "The pragmatic programmer", "Code Complete", "Refactoring", the "Gang Of Four" book (a.k.a. "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software")...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope all this text was helpful :)&lt;/p&gt;

(gdb) p (int)[$eax retainCount]

&lt;p&gt;To create a standard size button we would have to do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;LONG units = GetDialogBaseUnits();
m_hButton = CreateWindow(TEXT("BUTTON"), TEXT("Close"), 
                 WS_VISIBLE | WS_CHILD | BS_DEFPUSHBUTTON,

                 hwnd, NULL, hInst, NULL);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where &lt;strong&gt;50&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;14&lt;/strong&gt; are respective DLU dimensions, &lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt; are horizontal and vertical dialog template units respectively, based on &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms645475%28VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;code&gt;GetDialogBaseUnits()&lt;/code&gt; function&lt;/a&gt; documentation remarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Nothing's perfect&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUT&lt;/strong&gt; as Anders pointed out, those metrics are based on the system font. If your window uses a shell dialog font or simply anything not making your eyes bleed, you're pretty much on your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get your own "dialog" base units, you have to retrieve current text metrics with &lt;code&gt;GetTextMetrics()&lt;/code&gt; and use character height and average width (&lt;code&gt;tmHeight&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tmAveCharWidth&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;code&gt;TEXTMETRIC&lt;/code&gt; struct respectively) and translate them with MulDiv by your own, &lt;strong&gt;unless&lt;/strong&gt; you are in a dialog, then &lt;code&gt;MapDialogRect()&lt;/code&gt; will do all the job for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;code&gt;tmAveCharWidth&lt;/code&gt; only approximates the actual average character width so it's recommended to use a &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd144938.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;code&gt;GetTextExtentPoint32()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; function on an alphabetic character set instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently received a non-pieceofcrapuous laptop, and I am in the process of copying everything from old to new. I'm trying to xcopy c:*.* from the old machine to an external hard drive, but because the cord pulls out so frequently, the xcopy is interrupted fairly often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I need is a switch in XCopy that will copy eveything except for files that already exist in the destination folder -- the exact opposite of the behavior of the /U switch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know of a way to do this? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use doxygen to document your Python code. You can either use the Python documentation string syntax:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;"""@package docstring
Documentation for this module.

More details.
"""

def func():
    """Documentation for a function.

    More details.
    """
    pass
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In which case the comments will be extracted by doxygen, but you won't be able to use any of the &lt;a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/commands.html#cmd_intro"&gt;special doxygen commands&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Or&lt;/strong&gt; you can (similar to C-style languages under doxygen) double up the comment marker (&lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;) on the first line before the member:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## @package pyexample
#  Documentation for this module.
#
#  More details.

## Documentation for a function.
#
#  More details.
def func():
    pass
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that case, you can use the special doxygen commands. There's no particular Python output mode, but you can apparently improve the results by setting &lt;code&gt;OPTMIZE_OUTPUT_JAVA&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;YES&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I'm a little surprised at the difference - it seems like once doxygen can detect the comments in ## blocks or """ blocks, most of the work would be done and you'd be able to use the special commands in either case. Maybe they expect people using """ to adhere to more Pythonic documentation practices and that would interfere with the special doxygen commands?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Shoes.app do
  t = para "Not clicked!"
  button "The Label" do
    alert "You clicked the button!" # when clicked, make an alert
    t.replace "Clicked!" # ..and replace the label's text
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This made me think - how would I design a similarly nice-to-use GUI framework in Python? One that doesn't have the usual tyings of basically being wrappers to a C* library (In the case of GTK, Tk, wx, QT etc etc)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shoes takes things from web devlopment (like &lt;code&gt;#f0c2f0&lt;/code&gt; style colour notation, CSS layout techniques, like &lt;code&gt;:margin =&amp;gt; 10&lt;/code&gt;), and from ruby (extensively using blocks in sensible ways)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python's lack of "rubyish blocks" makes a (metaphorically)-direct port impossible:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def Shoeless(Shoes.app):
    self.t = para("Not clicked!")

    def on_click_func(self):
        alert("You clicked the button!")
        self.t.replace("clicked!")

    b = button("The label", click=self.on_click_func)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No where near as clean, and wouldn't be &lt;em&gt;nearly&lt;/em&gt; as flexible, and I'm not even sure if it would be implementable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using decorators seems like an interesting way to map blocks of code to a specific action:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class BaseControl:
    def __init__(self):
        self.func = None

    def clicked(self, func):
        self.func = func

    def __call__(self):
        if self.func is not None:
            self.func()

class Button(BaseControl):
    pass

class Label(BaseControl):
    pass

# The actual applications code (that the end-user would write)
class MyApp:
    ok = Button()
    la = Label()

    @ok.clicked
    def clickeryHappened():
        print "OK Clicked!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = MyApp()
    a.ok() # trigger the clicked action
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically the decorator function stores the function, then when the action occurred (say, a click) the appropriate function would be executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scope of various stuff (say, the &lt;code&gt;la&lt;/code&gt; label in the above example) could be rather complicated, but it seems doable in a fairly neat manner..&lt;/p&gt;

Suppose x = the smallest positive float your type can represent, say it's 10^-30.  If you multiply all your numbers by 10^30, and then try to represent them in binary (otherwise, why are you even trying so hard to make them ints?), then you'll lose basically all the information of the other numbers due to overflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here are two suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have control over all the related code, find another
approach.  For example, if you have some function that takes only
int's, but you have floats, and you want to stuff your floats into
the function, just re-write or overload this function to accept
floats as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don't have control over the part of your system that requires
int's, then choose a precision to which you care about, accept that
you will simply have to lose some information sometimes (but it will
always be "small" in some sense), and then just multiply all your
float's by that constant, and round to the nearest integer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, if you're dealing with fractions, rather than float's, then it's a different game.  If you have a bunch of fractions a/b, c/d, e/f; and you want a least common multiplier N such that N*(each fraction) = an integer, then N = a*b*c / gcd(a,b,c); and gcd(a,b,c) = gcd(a, gcd(b, c)).  You can use &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm" rel="nofollow"&gt;Euclid's algorithm&lt;/a&gt; to find the gcd of any two numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public enum ExampleEnum { FooBar, BarFoo }

public class ExampleClass : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    private ExampleEnum example;

    public ExampleEnum ExampleProperty 
    { get { return example; } { /* set and notify */; } }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want a to databind the property ExampleProperty to a ComboBox, so that it shows the options "FooBar" and "BarFoo" and works in mode TwoWay. Optimally I want my ComboBox definition to look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ComboBox ItemsSource="What goes here?" SelectedItem="{Binding Path=ExampleProperty}" /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I have handlers for the ComboBox.SelectionChanged and ExampleClass.PropertyChanged events installed in my Window where I do the binding manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a better or some kind of canonical way? Would you usually use Converters and how would you populate the ComboBox with the right values? I don't even want to get started with i18n right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So one question was answered: How do I populate the ComboBox with the right values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retrieve Enum values as a list of strings via an ObjectDataProvider from the static Enum.GetValues method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Window.Resources&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;ObjectDataProvider MethodName="GetValues"
        ObjectType="{x:Type sys:Enum}"
        x:Key="ExampleEnumValues"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;ObjectDataProvider.MethodParameters&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;x:Type TypeName="ExampleEnum" /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/ObjectDataProvider.MethodParameters&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/ObjectDataProvider&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/Window.Resources&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This I can use as an ItemsSource for my ComboBox:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ComboBox ItemsSource="{Binding Source={StaticResource ExampleEnumValues}}"/&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

maxWait="7000"
removeAbandoned="true"

&lt;p&gt;This works well enough for now. What is happening, afaik, is that once I reach the ten connections then Tomcat is checking for abandoned connections (idle time &gt; 3). It does this in a batch job each time that max connections is reached. The potential issue with this is if i need more than 10 queries run at the same time (not unique to me). The important thing is that removeAbandonedTimeout is less than maxWait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this what should be happening? ie Is this the way that the pool should operate? If it is is seems, at least to me, that you would wait until something (the connection) is broken before fixing rather than not letting it 'break' in the first place.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt; Since this posting has garnered an impressive number of downvotes for such a simple answer to an equally simple question, let me add an explanation. &lt;strong&gt;Please&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;read this before downvoting&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, &lt;strong&gt;this code is not intendend as a drop-in replacement&lt;/strong&gt; to the code in the question. It is for illustration purpose only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Computer.FileSystem.CopyDirectory&lt;/code&gt; does some additional correctness tests (e.g. whether the source and target are valid directories, whether the source is a parent of the target etc.) that are missing from this answer. That code is probably also more optimized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the code &lt;em&gt;works well&lt;/em&gt;. It &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; (almost identically) been used in a mature software for years. Apart from the inherent fickleness present with all IO handlings (e.g. what happens if the user manually unplugs the USB drive while your code is writing to it?), there are no known problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, Id like to point out that the use of recursion here is absolutely not a problem. Neither in theory (conceptually, its the most elegant solution) nor in practice: &lt;em&gt;this code will not overflow the stack&lt;/em&gt;. The stack is large enough to handle even deeply nested file hierarchies. Long before stack space becomes a problem, the folder path length limitation kicks in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that a &lt;em&gt;malicious user&lt;/em&gt; might be able to break this assumption by using deeply-nested directories of one letter each. I havent tried this. But just to illustrate the point: in order to make this code overflow on a typical computer, the directories would have to be nested a few &lt;em&gt;thousand&lt;/em&gt; times. This is simply not a realistic scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can define an abstract base class&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Base { virtual bool Method(int i, const string&amp;amp; s) = 0; };
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then write each of your cases as a subclass, such as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Case1 : public Base { virtual bool Method(..) { /* implement */; } };
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, you will get your "num" variable that indicates which test to execute.  You could write a factory function that takes this num (I'll call it which_case), and returns a pointer to Base, and then call Method from that pointer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Base* CreateBase(int which_num) { /* metacode: return new Case[which_num]; */ }
// ... later, when you want to actually call your method ...
Base* base = CreateBase(23);
base-&amp;gt;Method(999, "hello world!");
delete base;  // Or use a scoped pointer.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, this application makes me wish C++ supported static virtual functions, or something like "type" as a builtin type - but it doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The   storage   for   objects    with    static    storage 
  duration   (&lt;em&gt;basic.stc.static&lt;/em&gt;) shall be zero-initialized (&lt;em&gt;dcl.init&lt;/em&gt;)
  before any   other   initialization  takes  place. Objects  of 
  POD    types   (&lt;em&gt;basic.types&lt;/em&gt;) with static storage duration
  initialized with constant   expressions (&lt;em&gt;expr.const&lt;/em&gt;) shall be 
  initialized  before  any  dynamic   initialization  takes  place. 
  Objects of namespace scope with static   storage duration defined in
  the same translation unit and  dynamically   initialized  shall  be
  initialized in the order in which their definition  appears  in 
  the  translation  unit. [Note:  &lt;em&gt;dcl.init.aggr&lt;/em&gt;  describes  the 
  order in which aggregate members are initialized. The 
  initialization of local static objects is described in &lt;em&gt;stmt.dcl&lt;/em&gt;.  ]&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;[more text below adding more liberties for compiler writers]&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h2&gt;6.7  Declaration statement                                  [stmt.dcl]&lt;/h2&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h3&gt;4&lt;/h3&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The zero-initialization (&lt;em&gt;dcl.init&lt;/em&gt;) of all local objects with 
  static storage  duration  (&lt;em&gt;basic.stc.static&lt;/em&gt;) is performed before
  any other initialization  takes   place. A   local  object of 
  POD type (&lt;em&gt;basic.types&lt;/em&gt;)  with static  storage  duration
  initialized with constant-expressions is initialized before its
  block is first entered. An implementation  is  permitted to perform
  early initialization of other local objects with static storage
  duration under the same conditions that an implementation is
  permitted to statically initialize an object with static storage
  duration in namespace scope  (&lt;em&gt;basic.start.init&lt;/em&gt;). Otherwise  such
  an object is initialized the first time control passes through its
  declaration; such an object is considered initialized upon the
  completion of its initialization. If the initialization exits by 
  throwing an exception, the initialization is not complete, so it will
  be  tried again the next time control enters the declaration.  If control re-enters the declaration (recursively) while the object is being
  initialized, the behavior is undefined.  [&lt;em&gt;Example:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;      int foo(int i)
      {
          static int s = foo(2*i);  // recursive call - undefined
          return i+1;
      }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;--&lt;em&gt;end example&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h3&gt;5&lt;/h3&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The destructor for a local object with static storage duration will
  be   executed  if  and  only  if  the  variable  was  constructed. 
  [Note:   &lt;em&gt;basic.start.term&lt;/em&gt;  describes  the  order  in which local
  objects with   static storage duration are destroyed.  ]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am in the process of creating an ASP.NET custom control, this is something that is still relatively new to me, so please bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am thinking about the event model. Since we are not using Web Controls there are no events being fired from buttons, rather I am manually calling &lt;strong&gt;__doPostBack&lt;/strong&gt; with the appropriate arguments. However this can obviously mean that there are a lot of postbacks occuring when say, selecting options (which render differently when selected).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In time, I will need to make this more Ajax-y and responsive, so I will need to change the event binding to call local Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I was thinking I should be able to toggle the "mode" of the control, it can either use postback and handlle itself, or you can specify the Javascript function names to call instead of the doPostBack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are your thoughts on this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Am I approaching the raising of the events from the control in the wrong way? (totally open to suggestions here!)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I am creating a custom rendered control (i.e. inherits from WebControl).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are not using existnig Web Controls since we want complete control over the rendered output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AFAIK the only way to get a server side event to occur from a custom rendered control is to call doPostBack from the rendered elements (please correct if wrong!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ASP.NET MVC is not an option.&lt;/li&gt;

Here's what I don't understand: if there was ambiguity in the original query, why didn't Oracle throw an error? As far as I understood, in the case of left joins, the "main" table in the query (PARTS) has precedence in ambiguity. 
Am I wrong, or just not thinking about this problem correctly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) &lt;strong&gt;Declare const functions whenever possible&lt;/strong&gt;.  At first, I found this to be just extra work, but then I started passing my objects to functions with signatures like f(const Object&amp;amp; o), and suddenly the compiler barfed on a line in f such as o.GetAValue(), because I hadn't marked GetAValue as a const function.  This can surprise you especially when you subclass something and don't mark your version of the virtual methods as const - in that case the compile could fail on some function you've never heard of before that was written for the base class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) &lt;strong&gt;Avoid mutable variables&lt;/strong&gt; when it's practical.  A tempting trap can be to allow read operations to alter state, such as if you're building a "smart" object that does lazy or asynchronous i/o operations.  If you can manage this with only one small mutable variable (like a bool), then, in my experience, this makes sense.  However, if you find yourself marking every member variable as mutable in order to keep some operations const, you're defeating the purpose of the const keyword.  What can go wrong is that a function which thinks it's not altering your class (since it only calls const methods) my invoke a bug in your code, and it could take a lot of effort to even realize this bug is in your class, since the other coder (rightly) assumes your data is const because he or she is only calling const methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old T1 processors (T1000 and T2000 boxes) did have only a single FPU, and weren't really suitable for tasks with much more than about 1% floating point.

&lt;p&gt;Why not just store the data in a hash? If you do..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;data_container = {'foo' =&amp;gt; ['goo', 'baz']}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;..it is then utterly trivial to get the 'foo' name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[edit]&lt;/em&gt; After clarification, I see the issue, but I don't think this is the problem.. With [foo, bar, bla], it's equivalent like saying &lt;code&gt;['content 1', 'content 2',  'etc']&lt;/code&gt;. The actual variables name is (or rather, should be) utterly irrelevant. If the name of the variable is important, that is exactly why hashes exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem isn't with iterating over [foo, bar] etc, it's the fundamental problem with how the SOAP server is returing the data, and/or how you're trying to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution, I would say, is to either make the SOAP server return hashes, or, since you know there is always going to be three elements, can you not do something like..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{"foo" =&amp;gt; foo, "goo" =&amp;gt; goo, "bar"=&amp;gt;bar}.each do |param_name, param|

&lt;p&gt;What I do when I have to assemble a PC is find the purpose first. Dev PC? gaming? multimedia? Office?
Then I think about the requirements. Obviously, a simple office PC works with a lot less harddrive space, an onboard GPU, etc. When I figured that out I scour the internet for reviews, already composed systems, tom's hardware benchmarks, to try to find the best combination within my budget. Another thing to take into account is new developments. If for instance Intel is releasing a new CPU model within the month, I'd wait for that so the prices of the lower models will drop.
Once I have the list of required components I either go to my local computer store or find the best price on the net. I prefer a local store, because that saves me a lot of time when I get a dead component or need to claim my warranty. Usually a bit more expensive though.&lt;/p&gt;

The following stored procedure returns two result sets, how do I access them from, for example, another stored procedure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CREATE PROCEDURE getOrder (@orderId as numeric) AS
BEGIN   
    select order_address, order_number from order_table where order_id = @orderId
    select item, number_of_items, cost from order_line where order_id = @orderId
END
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to be able to iterate through both result sets individually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Just to clarify the question, I want to test the stored procedures. I have a set of stored procedures which are used from a VB.NET client, which return multiple result sets. These are not going to be changed to a table valued function, I can't in fact change the procedures at all. Changing the procedure is not an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result sets returned by the procedures are not the same data types or number of columns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for nested transactions they are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;BEGIN
  delete from Employee where departmentId = 1;
  BEGIN
     delete from Department where companyId = 2;
     BEGIN
        delete from Company where companyId = 2;

END

&lt;p&gt;Programmatically it looks different of course, but that'd depend on the platform you are using&lt;/p&gt;

Having a qualified instructor explain exactly what the differences are between a DataSet, DataReader (and so forth -- there are a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of different data access object types) is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;invaluable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;1&gt;Setup symbols&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at these commands. (Help: in console .hh &amp;lt; command&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.sympath
.sympath+ 
.symfix
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2&gt;Set up source path&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.srcpath
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3&gt;Load SOS extention to debug managed / mixed mode programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Make sure you have extention path setup correctly)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727 for x86 using-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.extpath
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set a breakpoint for the clr to load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sxe ld:mscorwks
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(F5 / g)
(Wait for  ModLoad BP on mscorwks.dll)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you dont have a duplicate sos extention already loaded. See:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.chain
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we're ready to load the sos extention. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.loadby sos mscorwks
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4&gt; Reload all the symbols..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.reload
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you're all set :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So since this join will have all records from PARTS with only some pull through from CATEGORIES you will have NULL in the CATCD field any time there is no data on the right side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By explicitly defining the column as from PARTS (ie left side) you will get a non null value assuming that the field has data in PARTS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that with LEFT JOIN you are only guarantied data in fields from the left table, there may well be empty columns to the right.&lt;/p&gt;
