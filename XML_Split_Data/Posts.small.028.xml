&lt;p&gt;This is the plan: Nothing elegant but easier in terms of development and troubleshooting. Since it is a one time job, we just have to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Host a remoting process (which i call the server) having the new version of the application. A remoting client has references for the older version. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remoting client instantiates and loads the objects with data required for migration. 
Convert the old objects into common serializable objects and pass as parameters to the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remoting Server uses the common data to instantiate and load the new objects. Invokes the functions on the new types to persist their data.&lt;/p&gt;

Either stick the results in a temp table and then reference the temp table from your sproc. The other alternative is to put the results into an XML variable that is used as an OUTPUT variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, however, pros and cons to both of these options. With a temporary table, you'll need to add code to the script that creates the calling procedure to create the temporary table before modifying the procedure. Also, you should clean up the temp table at the end of the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the XML, it can be memory intensive and slow.&lt;/p&gt;

One of them is the &lt;code&gt;__prepare__&lt;/code&gt; method, which allows you to supply your own custom dictionary-like object to be used instead -- this means you'll be able to track the order in which items are defined, and position them accordingly in the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run this, and pick the record with the largest score less than the returned weight.  If more than one record share that score, pick it at random.  The advantages here are that you don't have to maintain any sums, and you can tweak the probability equation used to suit your tastes.  But again, it works best with a larger distribution of scores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A better example would be the following (implementations omitted):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Rectangle {

    int getWidth() const;
    void setWidth(int value);

class Square : public Rectangle { };

&lt;p&gt;Now we have a problem although the interface matches. The reason is that we have violated (implied) invariants. The way getters and setters work, a &lt;code&gt;Rectangle&lt;/code&gt; should satisfy the following invariant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void invariant(Rectangle&amp;amp; r) {
    r.setHeight(200);
    r.setWidth(100);
    assert(r.getHeight() == 200 and r.getWidth() == 100);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this invariant &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be violated by a correct implementation of &lt;code&gt;Square&lt;/code&gt;, therefore it is not a valid substitute of &lt;code&gt;Rectangle&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Some of the SQL sentences it tries to execute are "magically" in spanish localization (where , separates floating point numbers instead of .), leading to errors. &lt;/p&gt;

  the SQL expects '15.28' and not
  '15,28'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which looks wrong to me in various levels (how can SQL Server distinguish between commas to separate arguments and commas belonging to a floating point number?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is argument to a 'hash attack would be faster', but only if you're not salting the passwords as they're hashed. Normally, hashing functions allow you to provide a salt which makes the use of known hash table a waste of time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I'd say 'no'. Based on the above, as well as the fact that if you do somehow get clear-text expose, a salted, hashed value is of little value to someone trying to get in. Hashing also provides the benefit of making all passwords 'look' the same length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some computer systems store user
  passwords, against which to compare
  user log on attempts, as cleartext. If
  an attacker gains access to such an
  internal password store, all passwords
  and so all user accounts will be
  compromised. If some users employ the
  same password for accounts on
  different systems, those will be
  compromised as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;More secure systems store each
  password in a cryptographically
  protected form, so access to the
  actual password will still be
  difficult for a snooper who gains
  internal access to the system, while
  validation of user access attempts
  remains possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;A common approache stores only a
  "hashed" form of the plaintext
  password. When a user types in a
  password on such a system, the
  password handling software runs
  through a cryptographic hash
  algorithm, and if the hash value
  generated from the user's entry
  matches the hash stored in the
  password database, the user is
  permitted access. The hash value is
  created by applying a cryptographic
  hash function to a string consisting
  of the submitted password and,
  usually, another value known as a
  salt. The salt prevents attackers from
  building a list of hash values for
  common passwords. MD5 and SHA1 are
  frequently used cryptographic hash
  functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is much more that you can read on the subject on that page.  In my opinion, and in everything I've read and worked with, hashing is a better scenario unless you use a very small (&amp;lt; 256 bit) algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a practical standpoint though, that's a poor argument - A good hashing function (md5 or sha1 would be fine) can pretty much guarantee that for all meaningfully strings, especially short ones, there will be no collisions. Even if there were, having two passwords match for one account isn't a huge problem - If someone is in a position to randomly guess passwords fast enough that they are likely to be able to get in, you've got bigger problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would argue that storing the passwords in plain text represents a much greater security risk than hash collisions in the password matching.&lt;/p&gt;

If it's an attacker pulling down your database (or tricking your application into displaying the database), then plaintext passwords are useless. There are many attacks that rely on convincing the application to disgorge it's private data- SQL injection, session hijack, etc. It's often better not to keep the data at all, but to keep the hashed version so bad guys can't easily use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As your co-worker suggests, this can be trivially defeated by running the same hash algorithm against a dictionary and using rainbow tables to pull the info out. The usual solution is to use a secret salt plus additional user information to make the hashed results unique- something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;String hashedPass=CryptUtils.MD5("alsdl;ksahglhkjfsdkjhkjhkfsdlsdf" + user.getCreateDate().toString() +  user.getPassword);

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so what I'm hearing is that there's three different parts to the puzzle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flash&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The graphical editor used to make "Flash Movies", ie it's an IDE that focuses on the visual aspect of "Flash"  (Officially Flash CS3?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The official name for the display plugins (ie, "Download Flash Now!")&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A general reference to the entire technology stack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In terms of the editor, it's a linear timeline based editor, best used for animations with complex interactivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actionscript&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The "Flash" programming language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flex&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Adobe Flash IDE that focuses on the coding/programming aspect of "Flash" (Flex Builder?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Flash library that enhances Flash and makes it easier to &lt;em&gt;program&lt;/em&gt; for (Flex SDK?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is not bound to a timeline (as the Flash IDE is) and so "standard" applications are more easily accomplished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this correct?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may be running into concurrency issues, depending on how your application runs. Try performing your reads with the "nolock" keyword. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try adding in table aliases for your columns (and avoid the use of SELECT *), this helps out MSSQL, as it doesn't have to "guess" which table the columns come from. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you aren't already, move to SPROCs, this allows MSSQL to index your data better for a given query's normal result set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run a trace against your database to see what the incoming requests look like. You may notice a particular SPROC is being run over and over: generally a good sign to cache the responses on the client if possible. (lookup lists, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flex seems to be thier name for the 'Flex Builder' IDE (based on Eclipse), and the general approach of building flash files using &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MXML" rel="nofollow"&gt;mxml&lt;/a&gt; and ActionScript rather than the normal flash tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the mxml and ActionScript approach (i.e. Flex) is designed to appeal much more to programmers, where as the Flash side is designed more to appeal to graphic designers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end result of either approach is a .swf file which can be run in the browser's flash player plugin (although with Flex you can target the Adobe Air runtime instead if you want access to the file system and to run offline etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My advice would be, if you're coming from a programming background, to start with Flex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Error 1450 (&lt;code&gt;ERROR_NO_SYSTEM_RESOURCES&lt;/code&gt;): "Insufficient system resources exist to complete the requested service."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the documentation we've found suggests it is linked to the number of &lt;strong&gt;Free System Page Table Entries&lt;/strong&gt; running out.  We have 16GB RAM in these machines and use the &lt;code&gt;/3GB&lt;/code&gt; Operating System switch to squeeze the Windows kernel into 1GB and allow our processes access to 3GB of address space.  This drastically reduces the total number of Free System Page Table Entries, so combined with our heavy use of MapViewOfFile() it is perhaps not surprising that the kernel page table entries are running out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when using Performance Monitor to view the Free System Page Table Entries counter, the value is around 36,000 on reboot and &lt;strong&gt;doesn't go down when our application starts&lt;/strong&gt;.  I find it hard to believe that our application, which opens many large memory-mapped files, doesn't have any effect on the kernel page table.  If we can't believe the counter, it's much more difficult to test the effect of any system changes we make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a promising Knowledge Base article, &lt;a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/894067" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Performance tool does not accurately show the available Free System Page Table entries in Windows Server 2003&lt;/a&gt;, but it says the problem has been fixed in Service Pack 1, and we are already on Service Pack 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else struggled with or solved this issue?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I have checked !sysptes in windbg (debugging the kernel) and the value matches the performance counter, around 36,000.  I guess this is most likely to mean that there really are that many free page table entries and Windows &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; telling the truth.  It does leave the question of why we're getting 1450 errors though, if the PTEs are not running out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further update:&lt;/strong&gt; We never did get to the bottom of why the 1450 errors were occurring.  &lt;em&gt;However&lt;/em&gt;, instead we upgraded the OS on these servers to 64-bit Windows.  This allows the existing 32-bit applications (without recompilation) to access a full 4GB of virtual address space, and lets the kernel memory area with those pesky Page Table Entries be as big as it likes too.  I don't think we've had a 1450 error since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's the &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Flash CS3&lt;/a&gt; product that Adobe sells.  This is generally targeted at designers and uses a Timeline-based approach to creating SWFs.  Previously the Flash product was the only way to create SWFs, and SWFs generally were just used for animations and other visual effects not possible in a browser otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there's the &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash" rel="nofollow"&gt;Flash Player&lt;/a&gt;.  This is the application/plugin used to run SWFs.  SWFs can also be wrapped in a "Projector" which allows them to run as a standalone app, but that's not as common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point (I don't know when) Flash started to be used for more interactive applications.  The Flash product wasn't very well suited for kind of work, as it was designed to create animations.  Recognizing this, Macromedia created &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Flex&lt;/a&gt;.  Flex is another development environment for creating SWFs, but it targeted more at developers than designers.  The latest version is &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Flex 3&lt;/a&gt;.  The &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/flexdownloads/index.html#sdk" rel="nofollow"&gt;Flex SDK&lt;/a&gt; is freely available and includes a command line compiler, debugger, and the class libraries.  Adobe also provides (for purchase) the &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/flexdownloads/index.html#flex_builder" rel="nofollow"&gt;Flex Builder&lt;/a&gt; app, an Eclipse-based IDE for creating SWFs using Flex.  There are some free IDEs for using Flex, most notably &lt;a href="http://www.flashdevelop.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;FlashDevelop&lt;/a&gt;, though I don't know of any that provide a visual designer for MXML, the markup language used by Flex to define UIs, or a visual wrapper for the debugger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're approaching Flash from a developer's perspective then you're going to want to use Flex.  It's probably a lot closer to what you're used to dealing with, and seems to be the direction Adobe is pushing Flash in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're providing something like Google's search box to users, having handy shortcuts like "c-f" is nice for them.  Underneath, though, I would convert "c-f" into "celsius" and "fahrenheit" in an outer function before calling convertTemperature() as above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Adding new values is easy.
2) I avoid doing string comparison&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, how do you write the conversion method? 3p2 is 6. So that means there are 6 different combinations of celsius, Fahrenheit, and kelvin. What if I wanted to add a new temperate format "foo"? That would mean 4p2 which is 12! Two more? 5p2 = 20 combination. Three more? 6p2 = 30 combinations! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can quickly see how each additional modification requires more and more changes to the code. For this reason I don't do direct conversions! Instead, I do an intermediate conversion. I'd pick one temperature, say Kelvin. And initially, I'd convert to kelvin. I'd then convert kelvin to the desired temperature. Yes, It does result in an extra calculation. However, it makes scalling the code a ton easier. adding adding a new temperature unit will always result in only two new modifications to the code. Easy.&lt;/p&gt;

If you need to add another scale, that's one more parameter value to handle. In the second approach, adding another scale means adding as many values as you already had scales on the list, times 2. (For example, to add K to C and F, you'd have to add K-C, K-F, C-K, and C-F.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decent way to structure your program would be to first convert whatever comes in to an arbitrarily chosen intermediate scale, and then convert from that intermediate scale to the outgoing scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A better way would be to have a little library of slopes and intercepts for the various scales, and just look up the numbers for the incoming and outgoing scales and do the calculation in one generic step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;gdb$ rwatch $ebx+0xec1a04f

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, and by the way. You need either hardware &lt;strong&gt;or software support&lt;/strong&gt;. Software is obviously much slower. To find out if your OS supports hardware watchpoints you can see the &lt;em&gt;can-use-hw-watchpoints&lt;/em&gt; environment setting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;gdb$ show can-use-hw-watchpoints

&lt;p&gt;A quote from the first article; Tips for using Unicode:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Embrace Unicode, don't fight it; it's probably the right thing to do, and if it weren't you'd probably have to anyhow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inside your software, store text as UTF-8 or UTF-16; that is to say, pick one of the two and stick with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interchange data with the outside world using XML whenever possible; this makes a whole bunch of potential problems go away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to make your application browser-based rather than write your own client; the browsers are getting really quite good at dealing with the texts of the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're using someone else's library code (and of course you are), assume its Unicode handling is broken until proved to be correct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're doing search, try to hand the linguistic and character-handling problems off to someone who understands them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go off to Amazon or somewhere and buy the latest revision of the printed Unicode standard; it contains pretty well everything you need to know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend some time poking around the Unicode web site and learning how the code charts work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're going to have to do any serious work with Asian languages, go buy the O'Reilly book on the subject by Ken Lunde.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have a Macintosh, run out and grab Lord Pixel's Unicode Font Inspection tool. Totally cool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're really going to have to get down and dirty with the data, go attend one of the twice-a-year Unicode conferences. All the experts go and if you don't know what you need to know, you'll be able to find someone there who knows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/"&gt;TortoiseSVN&lt;/a&gt; is the best general use system [An integrated system is not standalone - Thanks Martin Kenny].  It integrates itself into Windows Explorer (You can use it in explorer or any shell dialog) so it works extremely well and gives you the full power of SVN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/"&gt;Ankhsvn&lt;/a&gt; is a good solution that integrates into Visual Studios (Except Express Editions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://svnnotifier.tigris.org/"&gt;SVN Notifier&lt;/a&gt; monitors your repositories and will notify you when anything changes.  It integrates with TortoiseSVN to show you diffs and commit logs.  Very handy when working in a team environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absolutely and brutally minimize the number of images you have that contain text. Doing so will make your life a billion percent easier since you won't have to get a new set of images for every friggin' language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be very wary of css positioning that relies on things always remaining the same size. If  those things contain text, they will &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; remain the same size, and you will then need to go back and fix your designs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you use character types in your sql tables, make sure that any of those that might receive international input are unicode (nchar, nvarchar, ntext). For that matter, I would just standardize on using the unicode versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're building SQL queries dynamically, make sure that you include the N prefix before any quoted text if there's any chance that text might be unicode. If you end up putting garbage in a SQL table, check to see if that's there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure that all your web pages definitively state that they are in a unicode format. See Joel's article, mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You're going to be using resource files a lot for this project. That's good - ASP.NET 2.0 has great support for such. You'll want to look into the App_LocalResources and App_GlobalResources folder as well as GetLocalResourceObject, GetGlobalResourceObject, and the concept of meta:resourceKey. Chapter 30 of &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0470041781"&gt;Professional ASP.NET 2.0&lt;/a&gt; has some great content regarding that. The 3.5 version of the book may well have good content there as well, but I don't own it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about fonts. Many of the standard fonts you might want to use aren't unicode capable. I've always had luck with Arial Unicode MS, MS Gothic, MS Mincho. I'm not sure about how cross-platform these are, though. Also, note that not all fonts support all of the Unicode character definition. Again, test, test, test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start thinking now about how you're going to get translations into this system. Go talk to whoever is your translation vendor about how they want data passed back and forth for translation. Think about the fact that, through your local resource files, you will likely be repeating some commonly used strings through the system. Do you normalize those into global resource files, or do you have some sort of database layer where only one copy of each text used is generated. In our recent project, we used resource files which were generated from a database table that contained all the translations and the original, english version of the resource files. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Test. Generally speaking I will test in German, Polish, and an Asian language (Japanese, Chinese, Korean). German and Polish are wordy and nearly guaranteed to stretch text areas, Asian languages use an entirely different set of characters which tests your unicode support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

We felt our needs were relatively simple.  We needed to manage versioning, have searching capabilities, and having an approval workflow.   SharePoint handled these three aspects great out of the box.  However; we also require that the footer on the Office 2007 (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint) documents reflect the document version, last person to modify, and last modification date.  These things can be done with office automation, but we have yet to find a complete solution.&lt;br /&gt;
We first tried to do it on the checking-in and checked-in events and followed this path for a while, however, the complication we ran into was after we made the changes to the document we had to no way of preventing the save from updating the version number.  This resulted in something similar to this:  Document checked-in  the document version should be v0.1 however it is v0.2 because we save the document after the footer is replaced.  If we look in the document history we there are 2 separate versions v0.1 does not have the footer v0.2 has the footer but it says v0.1 as that is the version the document was when it was replaced.  This is an unacceptable solution for us as we want the process to be completely handled on the user side so they would have full control to revert back to a version where the footer would be incorrect and not contain the correct data.  When we attempted to create a custom approval/check-in workflow we found that the same problem was present. The footer is necessary so that hard-copies can be traced back to their electronic counterpart.  Another solution that was proposed to us was to build plugins for office that would handle the replacement of the footer.  This is inadequate for our needs as it requires a client side deployment of our plugins which is undesirable by our clients.  What we are looking for is a clean solution to this problem.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Responding to your question seems
  fraught with peril by starting a flame
  war, so I'll proceed cautiously.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;There are a number of fundamental
  technical similarities between the
  Java Runtime and the Common Language
  Runtime, including garbage collected
  memory, an intermediate language
  (Microsoft IL versus Java ByteCode),
  core system libraries, and support for
  fairly high level languages, code
  security, and deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;However, each of these 'similar' areas
  also have a number of sizable and
  small differences, and it's beyond the
  scope of a simple Forum post to
  describe most of them.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I would suggest asking a more
  targetted question about any of the
  various runtime features and component
  areas (e.g. memory management,
  compilation, system libraries,
  security, etc.) and then we can
  provide a more targetted response
  (e.g. a blog, a technical article, or
  some books).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, Looks like IE always posts whatever the form action is.. Can't see a way to override it, as yet..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it really worth that much? Generally this just tends to be the page name?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now I am starting to think of it differently.  I am wondering if Mocks are more effective used to completely isolate the tested method from anything outside of itself.

I am only testing that method, and I only want to know how it reacts to these faked up external factors?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems incredibly tedious to do it this way but the advantage I am seeing is when the test fails it is because it is screwed up and not 16 layers down.  But now I have to have 16 tests to get the same testing coverage because each piece would be tested in isolation.  Plus each test becomes more complicated and more deeply tied to the method it is testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you could send an SMS within a program on the iPhone, you'll be able to write games that spam people in the background.  I'm sure you really want to have spams from your friends, "Try out this new game!  It roxxers my boxxers, and yours will be too! roxxersboxxers.com!!!! If you sign up now you'll get 3,200 RB points!!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has restrictions for automated (or even partially automated) SMS and dialing operations.  (Imagine if the game instead dialed 911 at a particular time of day)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your best bet is to setup an intermediate server on the internet that uses an online SMS sending service, and send the SMSs via that route if you need complete automation.  (ie, your program on the iPhone sends a UDP packet to your server, which sends the real SMS)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iOS 4 Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iOS 4, however, now provides a viewcontroller you can import into your application.  You prepopulate the SMS fields, then the user can initiate the SMS send within the controller.  Unlike using the "sms:..." url format, this allows your application to stay open, and allows you to populate both the &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;body&lt;/em&gt; fields.  You can even specify multiple recipients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This prevents applications from sending automated SMS without the user explicitly aware of it.  You still cannot send fully automated SMS from the iPhone itself, it requires some user interaction.  But this at least allows you to populate everything, and avoids closing the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/MessageUI/Reference/MFMessageComposeViewController_class/Reference/Reference.html"&gt;MFMessageComposeViewController&lt;/a&gt; class is well documented, and &lt;a href="http://blog.mugunthkumar.com/coding/iphone-tutorial-how-to-send-in-app-sms/"&gt;tutorials&lt;/a&gt; show how easy it is to implement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iOS 5 Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iOS 5 includes messaging for iPod touch and iPad devices, so while I've not yet tested this myself, it may be that all iOS devices will be able to send SMS via MFMessageComposeViewController.  If this is the case, then Apple is running an SMS server that sends messages on behalf of devices that don't have a cellular modem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iOS 6 Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No changes to this class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iOS 7 Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now check to see if the message medium you are using will accept a subject or attachments, and what kind of attachments it will accept.  You can edit the subject and add attachments to the message, where the medium allows it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limitations to this class&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that this won't work on phones without iOS 4, and it won't work on the iPod touch or the iPad, except, perhaps, under iOS 5.  You must either detect the device and iOS limitations prior to using this controller, or risk restricting your app to recently upgraded 3G, 3GS, and 4 iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, an intermediate server that sends SMS will allow any and all of these iOS devices to send SMS as long as they have internet access, so it may still be a better solution for many applications.  Alternately, use both, and only fall back to an online SMS service when the device doesn't support it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all linear functions, so you can implement something like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;float LinearConvert(float in, float scale, float add, bool invert);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where the last bool indicates if you want to do the forward transform or reverse it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within your conversion technique, you can have a scale/add pair for X -&gt; Kelvin.  When you get a request to convert format X to Y, you can first run X -&gt; Kelvin, then Kelvin -&gt; Y by reversing the Y -&gt; Kelvin process (by flipping the last bool to LinearConvert).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technique gives you something like 4 lines of real code in your convert function, and one piece of data for every type you need to convert between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I'm after is basically pointing the application at an assembly and choosing a given class from which to select properties that should be included in an exported HTML form as fields. That form will be then used in my ASP.NET MVC app as the beginning of a View.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I'm using Subsonic objects for the applications where I want to use, this should be reasonable and I figured that, by wanting to include things like differing output HTML depending on data type, Reflection was the way to get this done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I'm looking for, however, seems to be elusive. I'm trying to take the DLL/EXE that's chosen through the OpenFileDialog as the starting point and load it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;String FilePath = Path.GetDirectoryName(FileName);
System.Reflection.Assembly o = System.Reflection.Assembly.LoadFile(FileName);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That works fine, but because Subsonic-generated objects actually are full of object types that are defined in Subsonic.dll, etc., those dependent objects aren't loaded. Enter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;AssemblyName[] ReferencedAssemblies = o.GetReferencedAssemblies();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, too, contains exactly what I would expect it to. However, what I'm trying to figure out is how to load those assemblies so that my digging into my objects will work properly. I understand that if those assemblies were in the GAC or in the directory of the running executable, I could just load them by their name, but that isn't likely to be the case for this use case and it's my primary use case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what it boils down to is how do I load a given assembly and all of its arbitrary assemblies starting with a filename and resulting in a completely Reflection-browsable tree of types, properties, methods, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that tools like Reflector do this, I just can't find the syntax for getting at it. &lt;/p&gt;

If you don't specify an encoding when you use most text I/O classes, you will write UTF-8 with no BOM and read by first checking for a BOM then assuming UTF-8 (I know for sure &lt;code&gt;StreamReader&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;StreamWriter&lt;/code&gt; behave this way.)  This is pretty safe for "dumb" text editors that won't understand a BOM but kind of cruddy for smarter ones that could display UTF-8 or the situation where you're actually writing characters outside the standard ASCII range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally this is invisible, but it can rear its head in interesting ways.  Yesterday I was working with someone who was using XML serialization to serialize an object to a string using a &lt;code&gt;StringWriter&lt;/code&gt;, and he couldn't figure out why the encoding was always UTF-16.  Since a string in memory is going to be UTF-16 and that is enforced by .NET, that's the only thing the XML serialization framework could do.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when I'm writing something that isn't just a throwaway tool, I specify a UTF-8 encoding with a BOM.  Technically in .NET you will always be accidentally Unicode aware, but only if your user knows to detect your encoding as UTF-8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes me cry a little every time I see someone ask, "How do I get the bytes of a string?" and the suggested solution uses &lt;code&gt;Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes()&lt;/code&gt; :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If you continue to test each method in isolation, you have surprises and work cut out for you when you bring them all together ala the &lt;strong&gt;BIG BANG&lt;/strong&gt;. We build objects so that they can work together to solve a bigger problem.. By themselves they are insignificant. You &lt;strong&gt;need to know if all the collaborators are working as expected&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mocks &lt;strong&gt;make tests brittle&lt;/strong&gt; by introducing duplication - Yes I know that sounds alarming. For every mock expect you setup, there are n places where your method signature exists. The actual code and your mock expectations (in multiple tests). Changing actual code is easier... updating all the mock expectations is tedious. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your &lt;strong&gt;test is now privy to insider implementation information&lt;/strong&gt;. So your test depends on how you chose to implement the solution... bad. Tests should be a independent spec that can be met by multiple solutions. I should have the freedom to just press delete on a block of code and reimplement &lt;strong&gt;without&lt;/strong&gt; having to rewrite the test suite.. coz the requirements still stay the same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To close, I'll say "If it quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, then it probably is a duck" - If it feels wrong.. it probably is. *Use mocks to abstract out problem children like IO operations, databases, third party components and the like.. Like salt, some of it is necessary.. too much and :x *&lt;br /&gt;
This is the holy war of State based vs Iteraction based testing.. Googling will give you deeper insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clarification: I'm hitting some resistance w.r.t. integration tests here :) So to clarify my stand.. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mocks do not figure in the 'Acceptance tests'/Integration realm. You'll only find them in the Unit Testing world.. and that is my focus here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acceptance tests are different and are &lt;strong&gt;very much&lt;/strong&gt; needed - not belittling them. But Unit tests and Acceptance tests are different and should be kept different.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All collaborators within a component or package do not need to be isolated from each other.. Like micro-optimization that is Overkill. They exist to solve a problem &lt;strong&gt;together&lt;/strong&gt;.. cohesion. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You observe the input and output, and develop a set of rules or models that describe the operation of the object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say you want to develop a USB camera driver.  The "black box" is the software driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop hooks into the OS and/or driver so you can see the inputs and outputs of the driver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate typical inputs, and record the outputs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze the outputs and synthesize a model that describes the relationship between the input and output&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test the model - put it in place of the black box driver, and run your tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it does everything you need, you're done, if not rinse and repeat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this is just a regular problem solving/scientific process.  For instance, weather forecasters do the same thing - they observe the weather, test the current conditions against the model, which predicts what will happen over the next few days, and then compare the model's output to reality.  When it doesn't match they go back and adjust the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method is slightly safer (legally) than clean room reverse engineering, where someone actually decompiles the code, or disassembles the product, analyzes it thoroughly, and makes a model based on what they saw.  Then the model (&lt;em&gt;AND NOTHING ELSE&lt;/em&gt;) is passed to the developers replicating the functionality of the product.  The engineer who took the original apart, however, cannot participate because he might bring copyrighted portions of the code/design and inadvertently put them in the new code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you never disassemble or decompile the product, though, you should be in legally safe waters - the only problem left is that of patents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might agree that could be a good idea if the classes you're mocking doesn't have a test suite, because if they did have a proper test suite, you would know where the problem is without isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of them time I've had use for mock objects is when the code I'm writing tests for is so tightly coupled (read: bad design), that I have to write mock objects when classes they depend on is not available. Sure there are valid uses for mock objects, but if your code &lt;strong&gt;requires&lt;/strong&gt; their usage, I would take another look at the design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of mocks is to unit test your code in isolation of dependencies so you can truly test a piece of code at the "unit" level.  The code under test is the real deal, and every other piece of code it relies on (via parameters or dependency injection, etc) is a "Mock" (an empty implementation that always returns expected values when one of its methods is called.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mocks may seem tedious at first, but they make Unit Testing far easier and more robust once you get the hang of using them.  Most languages have Mock libraries which make mocking relatively trivial.  If you are using Java, I'll recommend my personal favorite: &lt;a href="http://www.easymock.org/"&gt;EasyMock.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me finish with this thought: you need integration tests too, but having a good volume of unit tests helps you find out which component contains a bug, when one exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that nothing protects you from crooked teammates, they can also store a copy of the date before hashing, for instance.

There is a lot of work that you need to put in that it feels brutal. But that is the essence of unit testing. How can you test something in isolation if you don't mock external resources?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, you're mocking away slow functionality (such as databases and i/o operations). If the tests run faster then that will keep programmers happy. There is nothing much more painful than waiting for really slow tests, that take more than 10 seconds to finish running, while you're trying to implement one feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If every developer in your project spent time writing unit tests, then those 16 layers (of indirection) wouldn't be that much of a problem. Hopefully you should have that test coverage from the beginning, right? :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, don't forget to write a function/integration test between objects in collaboration. Or else you might miss something out. These tests won't need to be run often, but are still important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could store the credit card numbers in a more secure database, and in the main db just store enough information to show to the user, and a reference to the card.

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the big names in databases don't have built-in queryable number-range pseudo-tables.  Or, more generally, easy pure-SQL data generation features.  Personally, I think this is a &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt; failing, because if they did it would be possible to move a lot of code that is currently locked up in procedural scripts (T-SQL, PL/SQL, etc.) into pure-SQL, which has a number of benefits to performance and code complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So anyway, it sounds like what you need in a general sense is the ability to generate data on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oracle and T-SQL both support a WITH clause that can be used to do this.  They work a little differently in the different DBMS's, and MS calls them "common table expressions", but they are very similar in form.  Using these with recursion, you can generate a sequence of numbers or text values fairly easily.  Here is what it might look like...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Oracle SQL:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;WITH
  digits AS  -- Limit recursion by just using it for digits.
    (SELECT
      LEVEL - 1 AS num
    FROM
      DUAL
    WHERE
      LEVEL &amp;lt; 10
    CONNECT BY
      num = (PRIOR num) + 1),
  numrange AS
    (SELECT
      ones.num
        + (tens.num * 10)
        + (hundreds.num * 100)
        AS num
    FROM
      digits ones
      CROSS JOIN
        digits tens
      CROSS JOIN
        digits hundreds
    WHERE
      hundreds.num in (1, 2)) -- Use the WHERE clause to restrict each digit as needed.
SELECT
  -- Some columns and operations
FROM
  numrange
  -- Join to other data if needed
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is admittedly quite verbose.  Oracle's recursion functionality is limited.  The syntax is clunky, it's not performant, and it is limited to 500 (I think) nested levels.  This is why I chose to use recursion only for the first 10 digits, and then cross (cartesian) joins to combine them into actual numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven't used SQL Server's Common Table Expressions myself, but since they allow self-reference, recursion is MUCH simpler than it is in Oracle.  Whether performance is comparable, and what the nesting limits are, I don't know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At any rate, recursion and the WITH clause are very useful tools in creating queries that require on-the-fly generated data sets.  Then by querying this data set, doing operations on the values, you can get all sorts of different types of generated data.  Aggregations, duplications, combinations, permutations, and so on.  You can even use such generated data to aid in rolling up or drilling down into other data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; I just want to add that, once you start working with data in this way, it opens your mind to new ways of thinking about SQL.  It's not just a scripting language.  It's a fairly robust data-driven &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming_language" rel="nofollow"&gt;declarative language&lt;/a&gt;.  Sometimes it's a pain to use because for years it has suffered a dearth of enhancements to aid in reducing the redundancy needed for complex operations.  But nonetheless it is very powerful, and a fairly intuitive way to work with data sets as both the target and the driver of your algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a better explanation of the technique you can look &lt;a href="http://www.jakpsatweb.cz/css/css-vertical-center-solution.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;the article I adapted it from&lt;/a&gt;, but basically it involves adding an extra element and applying different styles in IE and browsers that support &lt;code&gt;position:table\table-cell&lt;/code&gt; on non-table elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class="valign-outer"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class="valign-middle"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;div class="valign-inner"&amp;gt;

Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me.
        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;
    /* Non-structural styling */
    .valign-outer { height: 400px; border: 1px solid red; }
    .valign-inner { border: 1px solid blue; }
&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;!--[if lte IE 7]&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;
    /* For IE7 and earlier */
    .valign-outer { position: relative; overflow: hidden; }
    .valign-middle { position: absolute; top: 50%; }
    .valign-inner { position: relative; top: -50% }
&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;![endif]--&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!--[if gt IE 7]&amp;gt; --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;
    /* For other browsers */
    .valign-outer { position: static; display: table; overflow: hidden; }
    .valign-middle { position: static; display: table-cell; vertical-align: middle; width: 100%; }
&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways (hacks) to apply styles in specific sets of browsers. I used conditional comments but look at the article linked above to see two other techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: There are simple ways to get vertical centering if you know some heights in advance, if you are trying to center a single line of text, or in several other cases.  If you have more details then throw them in because there may be a method that doesn't require browser hacks or non-semantic markup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; We are beginning to get better browser support for CSS3, bringing both flex-box and transforms as alternative methods for getting vertical centering (among other effects). See &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5412912/align-vertically-using-css-3"&gt;this other question&lt;/a&gt; for more information about modern methods, but keep in mind that browser support is still sketchy for CSS3.&lt;/p&gt;

However, throughput depends on the cluster's ability to do computation near where data is stored. Using HDFS has 2 main benefits IMHO 1) computation is spread more evenly across the cluster (reducing the amount of inter-node communication) and 2) the cluster as a whole is more resistant to failure due to data unavailability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your data is already partitioned or trivially partitionable, you may want to look into supplying your own partitioning function for your map-reduce task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solution:&lt;br&gt;
1)  I've added a start commit hook script to TortoiseSVN using the hooks gui in the settings area of the right click menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) The script receive 3 pieces of information:      PATH  MESSAGEFILE  CWD&lt;br /&gt;
  For details see: &lt;a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-dug-bugtracker.html" rel="nofollow" title="Manual"&gt;Manual&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  These are passed as command line arguements to the script - for some reason I had thought they were set as temporary environmental variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My script then simply opens the file specified by the second arguement and adds in the custom text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the commit dialog comes up the custom text is there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Best of all if tortoisesvn is launched from a script directly into the commit dialog:&lt;br&gt;
e.g. [ tortoiseproc /command:commit /path:. /closeonend:1 ]&lt;br&gt;
The hooks are still called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yet another edit&lt;/strong&gt;: This needs to be a repeatable process, and it has to be able to be set up in a way that it can be called in C# code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In database A, I have a set of tables, related by PKs and FKs.  A parent table, with child and grandchild tables, let's say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to &lt;strong&gt;copy a set of rows from database A to database B&lt;/strong&gt;, which has identically named tables and fields.  For each table, I want to insert into the same table in database B.  But I can't be constrained to use the same primary keys.  &lt;strong&gt;The copy routine must create new PKs&lt;/strong&gt; for each row in database B, and must propagate those to the child rows.  I'm keeping the same relations between the data, in other words, but not the same exact PKs and FKs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would you solve this?  I'm open to suggestions.  SSIS isn't completely ruled out, but it doesn't look to me like it'll do this exact thing.  I'm also open to a solution in LINQ, or using typed DataSets, or using some XML thing, or just about anything that'll work in SQL Server 2005 and/or C# (.NET 3.5).  The best solution wouldn't require SSIS, and wouldn't require writing a lot of code.  But I'll concede that this "best" solution may not exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I didn't make this task up myself, nor the constraints; this is how it was given to me.)&lt;/p&gt;

On a more finely grained scale however if you're designing loosely coupled code then you can draw lines throughout your code almost arbitrarily as to what might at any point be an 'outside system'.  Take a project I'm working on currently:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone attempts to check in, the &lt;strong&gt;CheckInUi&lt;/strong&gt; sends a &lt;strong&gt;CheckInInfo&lt;/strong&gt; object to a &lt;strong&gt;CheckInMediator&lt;/strong&gt; object which validates it using a &lt;strong&gt;CheckInValidator&lt;/strong&gt;, then if it is ok, it fills a domain object named &lt;strong&gt;Transaction&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;CheckInInfo&lt;/strong&gt; using &lt;strong&gt;CheckInInfoAdapter&lt;/strong&gt; then passes the &lt;strong&gt;Transaction&lt;/strong&gt; to an instance of &lt;strong&gt;ITransactionDao.SaveTransaction()&lt;/strong&gt; for persistence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am right now writing some automated &lt;em&gt;integration tests&lt;/em&gt; and obviously the &lt;strong&gt;CheckInUi&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;ITransactionDao&lt;/strong&gt; are windows unto external systems and they're the ones which should be mocked.  However, whose to say that at some point &lt;strong&gt;CheckInValidator&lt;/strong&gt; won't be making a call to a web service?   That is why when you write &lt;em&gt;unit tests&lt;/em&gt; you assume that everything other than the specific functionality of your class is an external system.  Therefore in my unit test of &lt;strong&gt;CheckInMediator&lt;/strong&gt; I mock out all the objects that it talks to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; Gishu is technically correct, not everything needs to be mocked, I don't for example mock &lt;strong&gt;CheckInInfo&lt;/strong&gt; since it is simply a container for data.  However anything that you could ever see as an external service (and it is almost anything that transforms data or has side-effects) should be mocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An analogy that I like is to think of a properly loosely coupled design as a field with people standing around it playing a game of catch.  When someone is passed the ball he might throw a completely different ball to the next person, he might even throw a multiple balls in succession to different people or throw a ball and wait to receive it back before throwing it to yet another person.   It is a strange game.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now as their coach and manager, you of course want to check how your team works as a whole so you have team practice (integration tests) but you also have each player practice on his own against backstops and ball-pitching machines (unit tests with mocks).  The only piece that this picture is missing is mock expectations and so we have our balls smeared with black tar so they stain the backstop when they hit it.  Each backstop has a 'target area' that the person is aiming for and if at the end of a practice run there is no black mark within the target area you know that something is wrong and the person needs his technique tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really take the time to learn it properly, the day I understood Mocks was a huge a-ha moment.  Combine it with an inversion of control container and I'm never going back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key points of Scrum is being able to accurately predict what a team can get done in a sprint.  In order to do this, you must account for everything that is going to consume a developer's time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that things like documentation, testing, and peer reviews must all be taken into account as tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt;  Based on Mendelt's post, I'm going to clarify things a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)#Product_backlog"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Backlog:&lt;/strong&gt;  The product backlog is a high-level document for the entire project. It contains broad descriptions of all required features, wish-list items, etc. It is the "What" that will be built. It is open and editable by anyone. It contains rough estimates, usually in days. This estimate helps the Product Owner to gauge the timeline and, to a limited extent, priority (e.g. if "add spellcheck" feature is estimated at 3 days vs 3 months, that may affect the Product Owner's desire).&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sprint Backlog:&lt;/strong&gt; The sprint backlog is a greatly detailed document containing information about how the team is going to implement the requirements for the upcoming sprint. Tasks are broken down into hours with no task being more than 16 hours. If a task is greater than 16 hours, it should be broken down further. Tasks on the sprint backlog are never assigned, rather tasks are signed-up for by the team members as they like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Items on the &lt;em&gt;Product Backlog&lt;/em&gt; will not show things like documentation or testing, but the tasks on the &lt;em&gt;Sprint Backlog&lt;/em&gt; most certainly should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll give an example.  Say there is a "Feature A" on the Product Backlog, and its estimated time is 1 week.  On the Sprint Backlog, that might be broken up into the following tasks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Initial design document:              4 hours  
Development of subset 1 of Feature A: 8 hours  
Peer review of subset 1 of Feature A: 2 hours  
Testing of subset 1 of Feature A:     6 hours  
Development of subset 2 of Feature A: 8 hours  
Peer review of subset 2 of Feature A: 2 hours  
Testing of subset 2 of Feature A:     6 hours  
User Documentation for Feature A:     4 hours
---------------------------------------------
Total time                           40 hours
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit #2:&lt;/strong&gt;  The idea behind the Sprint Backlog is to be specific as humanly possible about exactly where you have to spend your time.  This is why tasks cannot be more than 16 hours long and it is how you get to a point where you can be very reliable in your schedule predictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you follow the Sprint Backlog guidelines religiously and make sure to include &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; that you spend development time on then you will be pleasantly surprised at how accurate your scheduling can be after a few sprints of practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Juan Manuel's example is the canonical example, if you use code there are many more chances of leaving spurious DocumentItems in the database that will come and bite you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cascading updates are useful, for instance, when you have references to the data by something that can change, say a primary key of  a users table is the name,lastname combination. Then you want changes in that combination to propagate to wherever they are referenced.&lt;/p&gt;

To me, it's usually just lack of familiarity with the DB and inability to find which FKs are in place before working with the DB that foster that fear.  Either that, or constant misuse of cascade, using it where the entities were not conceptually related, or where you have to preserve history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
While it may seem odd to think about purposefully causing a Blue Screen Of Death (BSOD), Microsoft includes such a provision in Windows XP. This might come in handy for testing and troubleshooting your Startup And Recovery settings, Event logging, and for demonstration purposes.

Here's how to create a BSOD:

Launch the Registry Editor (Regedit.exe).
Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\i8042prt\Parameters.
Go to Edit, select New | DWORD Value and name the new value CrashOnCtrlScroll.
Double-click the CrashOnCtrlScroll DWORD Value, type 1 in the Value Data textbox, and click OK.
Close the Registry Editor and restart Windows XP.
When you want to cause a BSOD, press and hold down the [Ctrl] key on the right side of your keyboard, and then tap the [ScrollLock] key twice. Now you should see the BSOD.

If your system reboots instead of displaying the BSOD, you'll have to disable the Automatically
Restart setting in the System Properties dialog box. To do so, follow these steps:

Press [Windows]-Break.
Select the Advanced tab.
Click the Settings button in the Startup And Recovery panel.
Clear the Automatically Restart check box in the System Failure panel.
Click OK twice.

Here's how you remove the BSOD configuration:

Launch the Registry Editor (Regedit.exe).
Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\i8042prt\Parameters.
Select the CrashOnCtrlScroll value, pull down the Edit menu, and select the Delete command.
Close the Registry Editor and restart Windows XP.
Note: Editing the registry is risky, so make sure you have a verified backup before making any changes. 
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I may be wrong in assuming you want BSOD, so this is a Microsoft Page showing how to capture kernel dumps:

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if the query optimizer in SQL Server will do so, but in the example above, if the column you are grouping on has an index the server should be able to satisfy the query without hitting the actual table at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this question, essentially there is no difference in the result.  Both count(*) and count('x') and say count(1) will return the same number.  The difference is that when using " * " just like in a SELECT all columns are returned, then counted.  When a constant is used (e.g. 'x' or 1) then a row with one column is returned and then counted.  The performance difference would be seen when " * " returns many columns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;:  The above statement about performance is probably not quite right as discussed in other answers, but does apply to subselect queries when using EXISTS and NOT EXISTS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, once the function template is instantiated, there is a function visible to the compiler that is no longer a template. GCC may re-use this definition across different compiler units because the standard states that each template shall only be instantiated once for a given set of type arguments [temp.spec]. Still, since the template is not exported, this should be limited to the compilation unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that GCC may expose a bug here in sharing its list of instantiated templates across compilation units. Normally, this is a reasonable optimization but it should take function specializations into account which it doesn't seem to do correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;very expensive (at least for me). The professional version I'm interested in costs $1,299 at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their Site is often slow and sometimes unreachable, which isn't a good sign&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some technical details like there seems not to be 'real' obfuscation, so at least class names remain visible. This may be good for plugin developement but not for general protection. Maybe I overlooked something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don't know how strong the protection really is because the trial edition functionality is heavily reduced (no HVM, no real encryption). My observations of the cracking community lead to the assumtion that they also use the trial version only. They seem to have developed an unpacker for the trial edition....&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;pros:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;... nevertheless do they regard the tool as one of the strongest protectors around. The HVM technology seems to be somewhat unique and could in fact prevent that there ever is dumpable msil code in memory. &lt;/li&gt;

In Release, the compiler inlined whichever version had been defined at the time, and you got differing versions of the function.&lt;/p&gt;

  to change the count(col) to count(&lt;/em&gt;),
  it means the same, when the col has a

  1215372.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to note - if you are using COUNT(col) (don't!) and col is marked NULL, then it will actually have to count the number of occurrences in the table (either via index scan, histogram, etc. if they exist, or a full table scan otherwise). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: if what you want is the count of rows in a table, use COUNT(*)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically, you need to define the specialization in the header file, but just about every compiler will handle this as you might expect: this is fixed in C++11 with the new "extern template" facility:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, according to both the C and C++ standard, if part of an array is initialized, then remaining elements of the array are default initialized.  For a character array, the remaining characters are all zero initialized (i.e. null characters), so the arrays are &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; initialized as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;char str1[32] = {'\0','\0','\0','\0','\0','\0','\0','\0',

&lt;p&gt;The large consulting firms I've worked with throw resources at it and hope they don't anger too many people.

To them (not all of them I know, but some definately), don't care if they screw up because they ultimately know they can convince the VPs and SVPs to keep them around.  &lt;/p&gt;

In ASP.NET Forms I used the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc188690.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;Model View Presenter&lt;/a&gt; pattern a lot since it went with the way ASP.NET Forms functioned the best.  That way I could reuse some code between the two views.  Then in your index.aspx page for the site, you just parse the user-agent string of the request to figure out the browser and redirect accordingly.  So, for example a person with an iphone comes to your site, you parse the &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/OptimizingforSafarioniPhone/chapter_3_section_3.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;user-agent string&lt;/a&gt; and figure out it is an iphone.  Then you redirect to m.sample.com which is pointing to Mobile/Index.aspx page.  Otherwise you redirect to Desktop/Index.aspx.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did the parsing of the user-agent string at the page level, but of course you could do this kind of logic in the HttpModule or HttpHandler level also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just rolled my own pages since we weren't targeting phones that have WML support.  That would be the only reason in my opinion to use the ASP.NET Mobile support, is if you want to support WML enabled phones also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, while it is possible to do neat conditional content additions as you have with a contextual selector and a prefix match on the &lt;code&gt;href&lt;/code&gt; attribute, CSS is considerably weaker than a general purpose programming language. To do more complex things you need to move the logic up a level and write out simpler instructions for the style engine to handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people don't like cascading at all.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cascade Delete may make sense when the semantics of the relationship can involve an exclusive &lt;em&gt;"is part of&lt;/em&gt;" description.  For example, and OrderLine record is part of it's parent order, and OrderLines will never be shared between multiple orders. If the Order were to vanish, the OrderLine should as well, and a line without an Order would be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The canonical example for Cascade Delete is SomeObject and SomeObjectItems, where it doesn't make any sense for an items record to ever exist without a corresponding main record.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; use Cascade Delete if you are preserving history or using a "soft/logical delete" where you only set a deleted bit column to 1/true.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cascade Update may make sense when you use a real key rather than a surrogate key (identity/autoincrement column) across tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The canonical example for Cascade Update is when you have a mutable foreign key, like a username that can be changed. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; use Cascade Update with keys that are Identity/autoincrement columns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cascade Update is best used in conjunction with a unique constraint.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to get an extra strong confirmation back from the user before allowing an operation to cascade, but it depends on your application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cascading can get you into trouble if you set up your foreign keys wrong.  But you should be okay if you do that right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's not wise to use cascading before you understand it thoroughly.  However, it is a useful feature and therefore worth taking the time to understand.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would recommend either removing the updatepanel and rolling your own solution for your specific business need for having it there, or implementing your own popup script (probably slightly easier to write).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, for some background, the "this._postbackSettings.async" is your AJAX.NET framework trying to figure out whether this is an async call or not. You might be able to overcome it by setting this programaticly before the postback is sent (catch the postback event and add the field to the postback request if it is not already there).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The argument in favor of having a separate CITY table would be that you only have to store each city's name once, then refer to it when you need it.

&lt;p&gt;If your customers need to have multiple addresses, then a separate table for that makes sense. If you have a really good reason to normalize the City column into its own table, then that can go, too, but I haven't seen that before because it's a free form field (usually).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A table heavy, normalized design is efficient in terms of space and looks "textbook-good" but can get extremely complex. It looks nice until you have to do 12 joins to get a customer's name and address. These designs are not &lt;em&gt;automatically&lt;/em&gt; fantastic in terms of performance that matters most: queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoid complexity if possible. For example, if a customer can have only two addresses (not arbitrarily many), then it might make sense to just keep them all in a single table (CustomerID, Name, ShipToAddress, BillingAddress, ShipToCity, BillingCity, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

This is quite easy to do by using a time accumulator. Physics is one system which is best run on a fixed timestep, and ticked multiple times per frame if necessary to avoid a loss in stability and keep the simulation smooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit of code to demonstrate the use of an accumulator:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const float STEP = 60.f / 1000.f;
float accumulator = 0.f;

void Update(float delta)
{
    accumulator += delta;

    while(accumulator &amp;gt; STEP)
    {
        Simulate(STEP);
        accumulator -= STEP;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not perfect by any means but presents the basic idea - there are many ways to improve on this model. Obviously there are issues to be sorted out when the input framerate is obscenely slow. However, the big advantage is that no matter how fast or slow the delta is, the simulation is moving at a smooth rate in "player time" - which is where any problems will be perceived by the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally I don't get into the graphics &amp;amp; audio side of things, but I don't think they are affected as much as Physics, input and network code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Favor normalization. Denormalization is a form of optimization, with all the requisite tradeoffs, and as such it should be approached with a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Ain%27t_Gonna_Need_It"&gt;YAGNI&lt;/a&gt; attitude.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure that client code referencing the database is decoupled enough from the schema that reworking it doesn't necessitate a major redesign of the client(s).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't be afraid to denormalize when it provides a clear benefit to performance or query complexity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use views or downstream tables to implement denormalization rather than denormalizing the core of the schema, &lt;em&gt;when data volume and usage scenarios allow for it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usual result of these rules is that the initial design will favor tables over columns, with a focus on eliminating redundancy.  As the project progresses and denormalization points are identified, the overall structure will evolve toward a balance that compromises with limited redundancy and column proliferation in exchange for other valuable benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 2 useful shortcuts for these, &lt;code&gt;C-x r k&lt;/code&gt; will kill a rectangle, and &lt;code&gt;C-x r t&lt;/code&gt; to insert (there are other rectangle commands with a &lt;code&gt;C-x r&lt;/code&gt; prefix, but these are the ones I use).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let's say you want to take some code and format it so that you can post it in a Stack Overflow post... you need to prefix with 4 spaces.  So, go to the beginning of the first line, &lt;code&gt;C-SPC&lt;/code&gt; to mark, then go to the beginning of the last line and &lt;code&gt;C-x r t &amp;lt;SPC&amp;gt; &amp;lt;SPC&amp;gt; &amp;lt;SPC&amp;gt; &amp;lt;SPC&amp;gt; &amp;lt;RET&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and there you have it!  Then you can just copy and paste it into Stack Overflow.  I have run into more complex situations where this is useful, where you actually have text you want to insert on every line at a particular place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the other situation like Dave Webb's situation, if you want to kill a rectangle, use &lt;code&gt;C-x r k&lt;/code&gt; though, because it's just a lot quicker ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, according to my &lt;a href="http://refcards.com/docs/gildeas/gnu-emacs/emacs-refcard-a4.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;reference card&lt;/a&gt; that I printed out when I first started, you can do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;C-x r r&lt;/code&gt;: copy to a register&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;C-x r y&lt;/code&gt;: yank a rectangle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;C-x r o&lt;/code&gt;: open a rectangle, shifting text right (whatever that means...)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;C-x r c&lt;/code&gt;: blank out a rectangle (I assume that means replace it with spaces, but you'd have to try it out to see)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;C-x r t&lt;/code&gt;: prefix with text (as described above)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;C-x r k&lt;/code&gt;: killing (as described above)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;ReadOnlyCollection&lt;/code&gt; provides a read-only wrapper for an existing collection, allowing you (Class A) to pass out a reference to the collection safe in the knowledge that the caller (Class B) cannot modify the collection (i.e. cannot &lt;strong&gt;add&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;remove&lt;/strong&gt; any elements from the collection.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are absolutely no thread-safety guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you (Class A) continue to modify the underlying collection after you hand it out as a &lt;code&gt;ReadOnlyCollection&lt;/code&gt; then class B will see these changes, have any iterators invalidated, etc. and generally be open to any of the usual concurrency issues with collections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, if the elements within the collection are mutable, both you (Class A) &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; the caller (Class B) will be able to change any mutable state of the objects within the collection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your implementation depends on your needs:
 - If you don't care about the caller (Class B) from seeing any further changes to the collection then you can just clone the collection, hand it out, and stop caring.
 - If you definitely need the caller (Class B) to see changes that are made to the collection, and you want this to be thread-safe, then you have more of a problem on your hands. One possibility is to implement your own thread-safe variant of the ReadOnlyCollection to allow locked access, though this will be non-trivial and non-performant if you want to support IEnumerable, and it &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; won't protect you against mutable elements in the collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lack of choice:&lt;/strong&gt; Most programs don't offer interfaces in multiple languages and when they do, those languages are usually English and the developer's native tongue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programming languages&lt;/strong&gt; which are almost completely bound to the English language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question then is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you translate your applications, would you limit the UI to the user's native tongue or give them the choice by enabling more than one language pack by default?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which language would your application default to (which is interesting mostly if you only install one language pack with your application)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And also generally I'd like to know how much value do you put into translating your applications on a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They are Anonymous Methods, not
  Anonymous Delegates.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  Posted on December 22, 2007 by staceyw1  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;It is not just a talking point because
  we want to be difficult. It helps us
  reason about what exactly is going on.
  To be clear, there is *no such thing
  as an anonymous delegate. They dont
  exist (not yet).  They are "Anonymous
  Methods"  period.  It matters in how
  we think of them and how we talk about
  them.  Lets take a look at the
  anonymous method statement "delegate()
  {}".  This is actually two different
  operations and when we think of it
  this way, we will never be confused
  again.  The first thing the compiler
  does is create the anonymous method
  under the covers using the inferred
  delegate signature as the method
  signature.  It is not correct to say
  the method is "unnamed" because it
  does have a name and the compiler
  assigns it. It is just hidden from
  normal view.  The next thing it does
  is create a delegate object of the
  required type to wrap the method. This
  is called delegate inference and can
  be the source of this confusion. For
  this to work, the compiler must be
  able to figure out (i.e. infer) what
  delegate type it will create. It has
  to be a known concrete type.  Let
  write some code to see why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;private void MyMethod()
{
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does not compile:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1) Delegate d = delegate() { };                       // Cannot convert anonymous method to type System.Delegate because it is not a delegate type
2) Delegate d2 = MyMethod;                         // Cannot convert method group MyMethod to non-delegate type System.Delegate
3) Delegate d3 = (WaitCallback)MyMethod;   // No overload for MyMethod matches delegate System.Threading.WaitCallback
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Line 1 does not compile because the
  compiler can not infer any delegate
  type. It can plainly see the signature
  we desire, but there is no concrete
  delegate type the compiler can see. 
  It could create an anonymous type of
  type delegate for us, but it does not
  work like that.  Line 2 does not
  compile for a similar reason. Even
  though the compiler knows the method
  signature, we are not giving it a
  delegate type and it is not just going
  to pick one that would happen to work
  (not what side effects that could
  have).  Line 3 does not work because
  we purposely mismatched the method
  signature with a delegate having a
  different signature (as WaitCallback
  takes and object).&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compiles:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;4) Delegate d4 = (MethodInvoker)MyMethod;  // Works because we cast to a delegate type of the same signature.
5) Delegate d5 = (Action)delegate { };              // Works for same reason as d4.
6) Action d6 = MyMethod;                                // Delegate inference at work here. New Action delegate is created and assigned.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In contrast, these work. Line 1 works
  because we tell the compiler what
  delegate type to use and they match,
  so it works.  Line 5 works for the
  same reason. Note we used the special
  form of "delegate" without the parens.
  The compiler infers the method
  signature from the cast and creates
  the anonymous method with the same
  signature as the inferred delegate
  type. Line 6 works because the
  MyMethod() and Action use same
  signature.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a central server that has a * TIdTCPServer listening* on it.  Then each client has a &lt;em&gt;TIdTCPClient&lt;/em&gt; on it. They connect to the server and &lt;strong&gt;block on a read&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;waiting&lt;/em&gt; for the &lt;strong&gt;server to write&lt;/strong&gt;.  Once the server receives a notification via a listening socket it &lt;em&gt;broadcasts&lt;/em&gt; to each of the waiting clients.  This is pretty much immediate notification of all the clients.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a central server that has a &lt;strong&gt;TIdTCPServer listenin&lt;/strong&gt;g on it.  Then each client has a &lt;strong&gt;TIdTCPClient&lt;/strong&gt; on it.  Those clients can &lt;em&gt;"ping"&lt;/em&gt; the server to ask for updates at a regular interval (use a session token to maintain state).  The frequency of the interval determines how quick the notification will be.  When once one of the clients needs to notify the others, it just notifies the server.  The server then uses a &lt;em&gt;message queue&lt;/em&gt; to make a list of all active client sessions and adds a notification for each.  Then the next time each of the clients connects it gives it the notification and remove it from the queue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain a &lt;em&gt;session table&lt;/em&gt; in the database where each client updates regularly that they have an active session, and removes itself when it disconnects.  You will need a maintenance process that removes dead sessions.  Then you have a &lt;em&gt;message queue table&lt;/em&gt; that a client can write an update to with one row for each current active session.  Then the other clients can regularly ping that table to see if there are any pending notifications for its session, if there are it can read them, act on them and then remove them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some sort of &lt;em&gt;peer to peer&lt;/em&gt; approach were the clients are aware of each other through information in the database and then they connect directly to each other and notify or ask for notifications (depending on firewall and NAT configurations).  A little more complex, but possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously the choice of implementation will depend on your setup and needs.  Tunning will be necessary to achieve the best results.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The components you need for this are the &lt;strong&gt;TIdTCPServer&lt;/strong&gt; (listener) and &lt;strong&gt;TIdTCPClient&lt;/strong&gt; (sender).  Both of which are in the Indy libraries in Delphi.&lt;/p&gt;

Outside the context of a UDF (even still inside a CFC), an un-scoped set statement implies the variables scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, in a CFC, the Variables scope is available to all of its functions; it is sort of the global scope within that CFC -- similar to the "this" scope, except variables scope is akin to "private" variables, whereas the this scope is akin to public variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test this, create test.cfc:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;cfcomponent&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;cfset foo = "bar" /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;cffunction name="dumpit" output="true"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;cfdump var="#variables#" label="cfc variables scope"&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;/cffunction&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/cfcomponent&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and a page to test it, test.cfm:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;cfset createObject("component", "test").dumpit() /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the results will be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img178.imageshack.us/img178/511/thisvariablesca4.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, to address another problem I see in your example code...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In CF, all User Defined Functions have a special un-named scope commonly referred to as the "var" scope. If you do the following inside a UDF:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;cfset foo = "bar" /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you are telling CF to put that variable into the var scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To compound things a bit, you can run into problems (variable values changing when you weren't expecting them to) when you are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; using the var scope in your inline UDFs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the rule of thumb is to always, Always, ALWAYS, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ALWAYS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; var-scope your function-internal variables (including query names). There is a tool called &lt;a href="http://varscoper.riaforge.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;varScoper&lt;/a&gt; that will assist you in finding variables that need to be var-scoped. Last I checked it wasn't perfect, but it's definitely a start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is a &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; idea to reference (display/use) variables without a scope (obviously excepting var-scoped variables, as you can't specify the scope to read from) in CFCs or even on your standard CFM pages. As of CF7, there were 9 scopes that were checked in a specific order when you read a variable without specifying the scope, first match wins. With CF8, there could be more scopes in that list, I haven't checked. When you do this, you run the risk of getting a value from one scope when you are expecting it from another; which is a nightmare to debug... I assure you. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in short: &lt;em&gt;implying&lt;/em&gt; a variable's scope (on set) is not a terrible idea (though I usually specify it anyway); but &lt;em&gt;inferring&lt;/em&gt; variable's scope (on read) is asking for trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

So at least adding the english language to all the versions makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

Anyone who really wants to open this safe can cut it open with an oxyacetylene torch, so why bother putting things in the safe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because using the padlock, locking your car, putting valuables in a safe, and using a CAPTCHA weeds out a large spectrum of relatively unsophisticated or unmotivated attackers.  The fact that it doesn't stop sophisticated, highly motivated attackers doesn't mean that it doesn't work at all.  Using a CAPTCHA isn't going to stop all spammers, but it's going to tremendously reduce the amount that requires filtering or manual intervention.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CodeGear (formally Borland) has a tool for &lt;a href="http://dn.codegear.com/article/32338"&gt;going from C# to Delphi&lt;/a&gt; that works OK.  I would assume the tools that go the other direction will work the same (requiring a lot of editing).  Here is a Swedish tool that works on the same CodeDOM principle to go from &lt;a href="http://w1.311.telia.com/~u31115556/desc/programs.htm#BabbelFisken"&gt;Delphi to C#&lt;/a&gt; (and a number of other languages).  There are others, I just can't find them right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option would be to upgrade to a more resent version of Delphi for .NET and port your code to .NET that way.  Once you get it working in Delphi for .NET (which will be pretty easy, except for the embedded DB, unless they have a .NET version) you can use &lt;a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/reflector/"&gt;.NET Reflector&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.denisbauer.com/NETTools/FileDisassembler.aspx"&gt;File Disassembler&lt;/a&gt; reverse the IL to C#.  You will still be using the VCL, but you can use C# instead of Object pascal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another similar solution would be to port it to &lt;a href="http://remobjects.com/oxygene"&gt;Oxygene by RemObjects&lt;/a&gt;.  I believe they have a Delphi Win32 migration path to WinForms.  Then use &lt;a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/reflector/"&gt;.NET Reflector&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.denisbauer.com/NETTools/FileDisassembler.aspx"&gt;File Disassembler&lt;/a&gt; reverse the IL to C#.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, no easy answers.  Language migration is easier then library migration.  A lot of it depends on what 3rd party components you used (beyond AbsoluteDatabase) and if you made any Windows API calls directly in your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another completely different option would be too look for an off shore team to maintain the application.  They can probably do so cheaply.  You could find someone domestically, but it would cost you more no doubt (although with the sagging dollar and poor job market you never know . . . )&lt;/p&gt;

Definitely factor out entities that have more than a few fields out into their own table, or entities whose makeup will likely change as your application's requirements changes (for instance - I'd factor out address anyways, since it has so many fields, but I'd &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; do it if you thought there was any chance you'd need to handle foreign country addresses, which can be of a different form. The same with phone numbers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in multithreading performance a good place to start is &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1c9txz50.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;MSDN threading guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When should the lock be used?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lock should be used to protect shared resources in multithreaded code.  Not for anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But is it necessary when the application does not spin off any other threads?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absolutely not.  It's just a time waster.  However do be sure that you're not implicitly using system threads.  For example if you use asynchronous I/O you may receive callbacks from a random thread, not your original thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Is there performance issues with using lock?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes.  They're not very big in a single-threaded application, but why make calls you don't need?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;...if that is a good design pattern to follow in the future[?]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Locking everything willy-nilly is a terrible design pattern.  If your code is cluttered with random locking and then you do decide to use a background thread for some work, you're likely to run into deadlocks.  Sharing a resource between multiple threads requires careful design, and the more you can isolate the tricky part, the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-SP1, this was working fine (and still works fine on our developer machines). Now that we've done some testing post-SP1 I've been pulling my hair out since yesterday morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, our NSIS installer script pulls the dlls and manifest files from the redist folder. These were no longer correct, as the app still links to the RTM version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I added the define for &lt;code&gt;_BIND_TO_CURRENT_VCLIBS_VERSION=1&lt;/code&gt; to all of our projects so that they will use the SP1 DLLs in the redist folder (or subsequent ones as new service packs come out). It took me hours to find this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've double checked the generated manifest files in the intermediate files folder from the compilation, and they correctly list the 9.0.30729.1 SP1 versions. I've double and triple checked depends on a clean machine: it all links to the local dlls with no errors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running the app still gets the following error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The application failed to initialize properly (0xc0150002). Click on OK to terminate the application.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the searches I've done on google or microsoft have come up with anything that relates to my specific issues (but there are hits back to 2005 with this error message).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any one had any similar problem with SP1?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Options:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the problem and fix it so it works as it should (preferred)
&lt;li&gt;Install the redist
&lt;li&gt;dig out the old RTM dlls and manifest files and remove the #define to use the current ones. (I've got them in an earlier installer build, since Microsoft blasts them out of your redist folder!)&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Edit:&lt;/b&gt; I've tried re-building with the define turned off (link to RTM dlls), and that works as long as the RTM dlls are installed in the folder. If the SP1 dlls are dropped in, it gets the following error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;c:\Program Files\...\...\X.exe&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm using a brute force method, where the computer generates some random daily polling data and then calculates three day averages to see if the average of the random data matches pollsters numbers. (Most companies poll numbers are three day averages)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, it works well for one iteration, but my goal is to have it produce the most common simulation that matches the average polling data. I could then change the code of anywhere from 1 to 1000 iterations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is my problem. At the end of the test I have an array in a single variable that looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[40.1, 39.4, 56.7, 60.0, 20.0 ..... 19.0]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program currently produces one array for each correct simulation. &lt;em&gt;I can store each array in a single variable, but I then have to have a program that could generate 1 to 1000 variables depending on how many iterations I requested!?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I avoid this? I know there is an intelligent way of doing this that doesn't require the program to generate variables to store arrays depending on how many simulations I want.&lt;/p&gt;

#mcavg is real data

if mctestavg == mcavg[2]: 
  mcwork = mctest 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It varies by DB implementation, but generally VARCHAR uses one or two more bytes of storage (for length or termination) in addition to the actual data.  So  (assuming you are using a one byte character set) storing the word "FooBar" &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CHAR(6) = 6 bytes (no overhead)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VARCHAR(10) = 8 bytes (2 bytes of overhead)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line is &lt;strong&gt;CHAR&lt;/strong&gt; can be &lt;em&gt;faster&lt;/em&gt; and more &lt;em&gt;space efficient&lt;/em&gt; for data of relatively the same length (within two characters length difference).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Microsoft SQL has 2 bytes of overhead for a VARCHAR. This may vary from DB to DB, but generally there is at least 1 byte of overhead needed to indicate length or EOL on a VARCHAR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As was pointed out by Gaven in the comments, if you are using a multi-byte, variable length character set like UTF8 then CHAR stores the maximum number of bytes necessary to store the number of characters. So if UTF8 needs at most 3 bytes to store a character, then CHAR(6) will be fixed at 18 bytes, even if only storing latin1 characters. So in this case VARCHAR becomes a much better choice.&lt;/p&gt;

However the actual effect is closer to obtaining a 0.95 when a zero is overwritten with a one, and a 1.05 when a one is overwritten with a one. Normal disk circuitry is set up so that both these values are read as ones, but using specialised circuitry it is possible to work out what previous "layers" contained. The recovery of at least one or two layers of overwritten data isn't too hard to perform by reading the signal from the analog head electronics with a high-quality digital sampling oscilloscope, downloading the sampled waveform to a PC, and analysing it in software to recover the previously recorded signal. What the software does is generate an "ideal" read signal and subtract it from what was actually read, leaving as the difference the remnant of the previous signal. Since the analog circuitry in a commercial hard drive is nowhere near the quality of the circuitry in the oscilloscope used to sample the signal, the ability exists to recover a lot of extra information which isn't exploited by the hard drive electronics (although with newer channel coding techniques such as PRML (explained further on) which require extensive amounts of signal processing, the use of simple tools such as an oscilloscope to directly recover the data is no longer possible)&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, most of the technologies that overwrite repeatedly are (harmlessly) doing more than what's actually necessary.  There have been attempts to recover data from disks that have had data overwritten and with the exception of a few lab cases, there are really no examples of such a technique being successful.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we talk about recovery methods, primarily you will see magnetic force microscopy as the silver bullet to get around a casual overwrite but even this has no recorded successes and can be quashed in any case by writing a good pattern of binary data across the region on your magnetic media (as opposed to simple 0000000000s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the 36 (actually 35) overwrites that you are referring to are recognized as dated and unnecessary today as the technique (known as the Gutmann method) was designed to accommodate the various - and usually unknown to the user - encoding methods used in technologies like RLL and MFM which you're not likely to run into anyhow.  Even the US government guidelines state the one overwrite is sufficient to delete data, though for administrative purposes they do not consider this acceptable for "sanitization". The suggested reason for this disparity is that "bad" sectors can be marked bad by the disk hardware and not properly overwritten when the time comes to do the overwrite, therefore leaving the possibility open that visual inspection of the disk will be able to recover these regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end - writing with a 1010101010101010 or fairly random pattern is enough to erase data to the point that known techniques cannot recover it.&lt;/p&gt;

Here is my attempt to describe my personal view on the topic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Requirements are the &lt;em&gt;single most important&lt;/em&gt; and crucial part of development.  In the business world, this document is what defines your deliverable, what you legally need to give the customer and get paid for.  In the case of your own personal projects, this is where you take out a sheet of paper and write down the goal of your project and then figured out your requirements from that goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have good requirements and can avoid changing requirements on a whim, this is where you can turn to napkin based design.  Think through what you want to code and draw it out on some paper, this helps you think through several possibilities and helps you write better code later because you have done some thinking already.  If requirements change, try and work it into a new revision, if that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start writing code, writing tests and keep good comments in code.  When you start on another module or section of your application, take a couple minutes to think through the overall design of that part, go back and forth between your napkin design and your code.  Accept that you will have to change and modify anything you thought was perfect before you started on another part of the application and adopt an iterative approach to your development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is one thing I have learned, any documentation of design is always out of date and you end up looking at the code anyway, keeping good comments is worth so much because of this.

&lt;p&gt;Also, indexing and full table scans are faster if your table has only CHAR columns. Basically the optimizer will be able to predict how big each record is if it only has CHAR columns, while it needs to check the size value of every VARCHAR column.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides if you update a VARCHAR column to a size larger than its previous content you may force the database to rebuild its indexes (because you forced the database to physically move the record on disk). While with CHAR columns that'll never happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you probably won't care about the performance hit unless your table is huge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember Djikstra's wise words. Early performance optimization is the root of all evil.&lt;/p&gt;

Bottom line, it's possible but becoming ever-harder to recover overwritten data from magnetic media.  Nonetheless, some (US-government) standards still require at least multiple overwrites.  Meanwhile, device internals continue to become more complex, and, even after overwriting, a drive or solid-state device may have copies in unexpected (think about bad block handling or flash wear leveling (&lt;a href="http://www.cypherpunks.to/~peter/usenix01_slides.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;see Peter Gutmann&lt;/a&gt;).

&lt;p&gt;The page will execute all of the queries before returning even the first update panel, so he won't save any time there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick to do this is to move each of your complex gridviews into a user control, in the user control, get rid of the Object DataSource crap, and do your binding in the code behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write your bind code so that it only binds in this situation: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (this.isPostBack &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ScriptManager.IsInAsyncPostback)

  &lt;p&gt;As far as I understood, in the case of left joins, the "main" table in the query (PARTS) has precedence in ambiguity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not clear whether by "main" you mean simply the left table in a left join, or the "driving" table, as you see the query conceptually...  But in either case, what you see as the "main" table in the query as you've written it will not necessarily be the "main" table in the actual execution of that query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My guess is that Oracle is simply using the column from the first table it hits in executing the query.  And since most individual operations in SQL do not require one table to be hit before the other, the DBMS will decide at parse time which is the most efficient one to scan first.  Try getting an execution plan for the query.  I suspect it may reveal that it's hitting CATEGORIES first and then PARTS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a pure JS solution, have your page submit to itself, but with additional URL parameter (mypage.html?postback=true) - you can then get the page url with window.location.href, and parse that using a split or regex to look for your variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The much easier one, assuming you sending back to some sort of scripting language to proces the page (php/perl/asp/cf et. al), is to have them echo a line of javascript in the page setting a variable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;?php
if ($_POST['myVar']) {
    //postback

    //Do other processing
} else {

 } ?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;
function myLoader() {

          //Do stuff
     }
 }

When I say disable backspace, I mean disable the ability for Backspace to mimic the Back browser button.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 -&lt;/strong&gt; You can repeatedly outer-join the table to itself to recursively walk up your tree, as in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT *
FROM
  MY_GROUPS MG1
 ,MY_GROUPS MG2
 ,MY_GROUPS MG3
 ,MY_GROUPS MG4
 ,MY_GROUPS MG5
 ,MY_GROUP_MEMBERS MGM
WHERE MG1.PARENT_ID = MG2.UNIQID (+)
  AND MG1.UNIQID = MGM.GROUP_ID (+)
  AND MG2.PARENT_ID = MG3.UNIQID (+)
  AND MG3.PARENT_ID = MG4.UNIQID (+)
  AND MG4.PARENT_ID = MG5.UNIQID (+)
  AND MGM.USER_ID = 9
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's gonna give you results like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;UNIQID PARENT_ID NAME      UNIQID_1 PARENT_ID_1 NAME_1 UNIQID_2 PARENT_ID_2 NAME_2  UNIQID_3 PARENT_ID_3 NAME_3 UNIQID_4 PARENT_ID_4 NAME_4 UNIQID_5 GROUP_ID USER_ID
4      2         Cerepedia 2        1           CATS   1        null        Cerebra null     null        null   null      null       null   8        4        9
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The limit here is that you must add a new join for each "level" you want to walk up the tree.  If your tree has less than, say, 20 levels, then you could probably get away with it by creating a view that showed 20 levels from every user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 -&lt;/strong&gt; The only other approach that I know of is to create a recursive database function, and call that from code.  You'll still have some lookup overhead that way (i.e., your # of queries will still be equal to the # of levels you are walking on the tree), but overall it should be faster since it's all taking place within the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure about MySql, but in Oracle, such a function would be similar to this one (you'll have to change the table and field names; I'm just copying something I did in the past):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION GoUpLevel(WO_ID INTEGER, UPLEVEL INTEGER) RETURN INTEGER

    FROM WOTREE
    WHERE ID = WO_ID;    
    iResult := GoUpLevel(iParent,UPLEVEL-1);  --recursive
  END;
  RETURN iResult;
  EXCEPTION WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND THEN
    RETURN NULL;
  END;
END GoUpLevel;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT 1:&lt;br /&gt;
This website seems to have some information as to how it's done. I can't verify it currently, but I'll look into it:
&lt;a href="http://www.ozzu.com/programming-forum/disable-key-and-back-t44867.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.ozzu.com/programming-forum/disable-key-and-back-t44867.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2:&lt;br /&gt;
This website has some key codes:
&lt;a href="http://www.advscheduler.com/docs/manual/type_sendkeys.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.advscheduler.com/docs/manual/type_sendkeys.html&lt;/a&gt;
It seems BACKSPACE is 08.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT 3: &lt;br /&gt;
Found some more code for blocking, check this out: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;

&amp;lt;script type="text/javascript"&amp;gt;var sType = "keypress";&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; 

&amp;lt;!--[if IE]&amp;gt; 
&amp;lt;script type="text/javascript"&amp;gt;sType = "keydown";&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; 
&amp;lt;![endif]--&amp;gt; 

&amp;lt;script type="text/javascript"&amp;gt; 
fIntercept = function(e) { 
   // alert(e.keyCode);
  e = e || event.e; 
  if (e.keyCode == 116) { 
   // When F5 is pressed 
   fCancel(e); 
  } else if (e.ctrlKey &amp;&amp; (e.keyCode == 0 || e.keyCode == 82)) { 
   // When ctrl is pressed with R 
   fCancel(e); 
  } 
}; 

fCancel = function(e) { 
  if (e.preventDefault) { 
   e.stopPropagation(); 
   e.preventDefault(); 
  } else { 
   e.keyCode = 0; 
   e.returnValue = false; 
   e.cancelBubble = true; 
  } 
  return false; 
}; 

fAddEvent = function(obj, type, fn) { 
  if (obj.addEventListener) { 
   obj.addEventListener(type, fn, false); 
  } else { 
   obj['e'+type+fn] = fn; 
   obj[type+fn] = function() { 
    obj['e'+type+fn](window.event); 
   } 
   obj.attachEvent('on'+type, obj[type+fn]); 
  } 
}; 


fAddEvent(document, sType, fIntercept); 
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, now you should have all you need to do it. To disable backspace, the keycode is 08. You can probably just use the code I posted with slight modifications only... :\&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try it out and see if it's what you needed. (I hope you know how to use Javascript.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, a can be any value from 0 to 500.  Then if follows that b+c+d+e = 500-a.  This reduces the problem by one variable.  Recurse until done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if a is 500, then b+c+d+e=0 which means that for the case of a = 500, there is only one combination of values for b,c,d and e.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a is 300, then b+c+d+e=200, which is in fact the same problem as the original problem, just reduced by one variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, I find people just zone out the second you start to go into details with a presentation. Conveying the information with a mind map (at least in my experience), provides a much easier way for the information to be conveyed and tied together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key is presenting the information in stages (ie, your high-level ideas first, then in more detail, one at a time). The mind-mapping tools basically let you expand your map, as the audience watches and your present more and more detailed information. Doing it this way lets your audience gradually absorb the data in smaller stages, which tends to aid retention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeMind" rel="nofollow"&gt;FreeMind&lt;/a&gt; for a free tool to play with. &lt;a href="http://www.mindjet.com/products/mindmanager_pro/default.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mind Manager&lt;/a&gt; is a paid product, but is much more polished and fluent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're on Vista hide your desktop icons and use one of the default wallpapers. Keep your Visual Studio settings (especially toolbars) as standard and "out of the box" as possible. The more customizations you show in your environment the more likely people are going to focus on those rather than your content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep the content on your slides as consisce as possible. Remember, you're speaking to (and in the best scenario, with) your audience so the slides should serve as discussion points. If you want to include more details, put them in the slide notes. This is especially good if you make the slide decks available afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone asks you a question and you don't know the answer, don't be afraid to say you don't know. It's always better than trying to guess at what you think the answer should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you are using Vista be sure to put it in "presentation mode". PowerPoint also has a similar mode, so be sure to use it as well - you have the slide show on one monitor (the projector) and a smaller view of the slide, plus notes and a timer on your laptop  monitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tests on my development machine have shown the average load time to be between 3 and 5 seconds, during which the application is totally locked.  While this isn't totally unacceptable, it's an awfully long time to lose control of the application.  Also, because the GUI thread is locked, I cannot show a loading dialog or something to mask the load time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;axMappointControl1.NewMap(MapPoint.GeoMapRegion.geoMapNorthAmerica);

&lt;p&gt;"On UNIX platforms you can send a signal to a program by using the kill command. This is the quit signal, which is handled by the JVM. For example, on Solaris you can use the command kill -QUIT process_id, where process_id is the process number of your Java program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively you can enter the key sequence &amp;lt;ctrl&amp;gt;\ in the window where the Java program was started. Sending this signal instructs a signal handler in the JVM, to recursively print out all the information on the threads and monitors inside the JVM."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm assuming you want numbers &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;=0&lt;/code&gt;.  If you want &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, replace the loop initialization with &lt;code&gt;a = 1&lt;/code&gt; and the loop condition with &lt;code&gt;a &amp;lt; sum&lt;/code&gt;.

You could change the for-loop if you wanted &lt;code&gt;a &amp;gt;= b &amp;gt;= c &amp;gt;= d &amp;gt;= e&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Approximately 1 in 256 bytes is known
  to be corrupted, and the corruption is
  known to occur only in bytes with the
  value '\012'. So the byte error rate
  is 1/256 (0.39% of input), and 2/256
  bytes (0.78% of input) are suspect.
  But since only three bits per smashed
  byte are affected, the bit error rate
  is only 3/(256*8): 0.15% is bad, 0.29%
  is suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;An error in the compressed input
  disrupts the decompression process for
  all subsequent bytes...The fact that
  the decompressed output is
  recognizably bad so quickly is cause
  for hope -- a search for the correct
  answer can identify wrong answers
  quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, several techniques were
  combined to successfully extract
  reasonable data from these files:&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Domain-specific parsing of fields and quoted strings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Machine learning from previous data with low probability of damage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tolerance for file damage due to other causes (e.g. disk full while
  logging)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lookahead for guiding the search along the highest-probability paths&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;These techniques identify 75% of the
  necessary repairs with certainty, and
  the remainder are explored
  highest-probability-first, so that
  plausible reconstructions are
  identified immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1438/jon-ericson"&gt;Jon Ericson&lt;/a&gt; points out (thanks Jon), subsequent commands may not work as intended if you do not take into account that a symbolic link to a directory will also pass this check.
E.g. running this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ln -s "$ACTUAL_DIR" "$SYMLINK"
if [ -d "$SYMLINK" ]; then 
  rmdir "$SYMLINK" 
fi
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;rmdir: failed to remove `symlink': Not a directory
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So symbolic links may have to be treated differently, if subsequent commands expect directories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if [ -d "$LINK_OR_DIR" ]; then 
  if [ -L "$LINK_OR_DIR" ]; then
    # It is a symlink!
    # Symbolic link specific commands go here.
    rm "$LINK_OR_DIR"
  else
    # It's a directory!
    # Directory command goes here.
    rmdir "$LINK_OR_DIR"
  fi
fi
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the querysource you do the contains with has more than 10 items in it, it does not pass the items correctly to the SQL query. It is hard to explain what it does, an example will show it best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at the raw query, the parameters look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;@P0 = 'aaa'
@P1 = 'bbb'
@P2 = 'ccc'
... [@P3 through @P9]
@P10 = '111'
@P11 = '222'
... [@p12 through @P19]
@P20 = 'sss'
... [@P21 through @P99]
@P100 = 'qqq'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when the values are passed into the final query (all parameters resolved) it has resolved the parameters as if these were the values passed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;@P0 = 'aaa'
@P1 = 'bbb'
@P2 = 'ccc'
...
@P10 = 'bbb'0
@P11 = 'bbb'1
...
@P20 = 'ccc'0
...
@P100 = 'bbb'00
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it looks like the parameter resolving looks at the first digit only after the @P and resolves that, then adds on anything left at the end of the parameter name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least that is what the Sql Server Query Visualizer plugin to Visual Studio shows the query doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if any one has advice please share. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The idea behind Pecha Kucha is to keep
  presentations concise, the interest
  level up and to have many presenters
  sharing their ideas within the course
  of one night. Therefore the 20x20
  Pecha Kucha format was created: each
  presenter is allowed a slideshow of 20
  images, each shown for 20 seconds.
  This results in a total presentation
  time of 6 minutes 40 seconds on a
  stage before the next presenter is up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, i am not sure if that short duration could be ok for a product demonstration. 
But you can try to get some nice ideas from the concept, such as to be concise and keep to the point, effective time, space management etc..&lt;/p&gt;

Then the unexpected stuff happens in private and you get as many stabs at it as you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You still usually need some environment to use as a reference for questions, but for the presentation bit, recording it in advance (and rehearsing your narration over the video) pretty much guarantees you can be at the top of your game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also like to put small jokes into the slides and that recorded video that make it seem like the person who made the slides is commenting on the live proceedings or that someone else is actually running the slides. Often, I make absolutely no reference at all to the joke in the slide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, in my &lt;a href="http://www.wynia.org/wordpress/2008/09/07/standardized-aspnet-mvc-controller-actions-with-visual-studio-item-templates/" rel="nofollow"&gt;most recent demo presentation&lt;/a&gt;, I had a slide with the text "ASP.NET MVC" centered that I was talking over about how I was using the framework. In a smaller font, I had the text "Catchy name, huh?". When I did that demo live, that slide got a chuckle. It's not stand-up worthy by any stretch of the imagination, but we're often presenting some pretty dry stuff and every little bit helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I've included slides that are just plain snarky comments from the offscreen guy about what I'm planning to say. So, I'll say, "The codebase for this project needed a little help", while the slide behind me said "It was a pile of spaghetti with 3 meatballs, actually" and a plate of spaghetti as the slide background. Again, with no comment from me and just moving on to the next slide as though I didn't even see it actually made it funnier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That can also be a help if you don't have the best comedic timing by taking the pressure off while still adding some levity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, what it really comes down to is that I've been doing most of my demo/presentation work just like I would if it was a screencast and then substituting the live version of me (pausing the video as appropriate if things go off the rails) for the audio when I give it in front of an audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can then easily make the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; presentation available afterward for those who want it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the slides, I generally go out of my way to not say the exact words on the screen more often than not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's as easy to write bad stored procedures as it is to write bad data access logic in your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My preference is for Stored Procs, but that's because I'm typically working with very large and complex apps in an enterprise environment where there are dedicated DBAs who are responsible for keeping the database servers running sweetly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other situations, I'm happy enough for data access technologies such as LINQ to take care of the optimisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pure performance isn't the only consideration, though. Aspects such as security and configuration management are typically at least as important.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Edit: While Frans Bouma's article is indeed verbose, it misses the point with regard to security by a mile. The fact that it's 5 years old doesn't help its relevance, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason imo to still favor stored procedures today has more to do with security.  If you use stored procedures &lt;em&gt;exclusively&lt;/em&gt;, you can disable INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER, DROP, and CREATE etc permissions for your application's user, only leaving it with EXECUTE.  &lt;/p&gt;

But even in cases where performance is &lt;em&gt;hampered&lt;/em&gt; by a stored procedure, there are good reasons to use them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Application developers aren't always the best SQL coders.  Stored procedures hides SQL from the application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stored procedures automatically use bind variables.  Application developers often avoid bind variables because they seem like unneeded code and show little benefit in small test systems.  Later on, the failure to use bind variables can throttle RDBMS performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stored procedures create a layer of indirection that might be useful later on.  It's possible to change implementation details (including table structure) on the database side without touching application code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exercise of creating stored procedures can be useful for documenting all database interactions for a system.  And it's easier to update the documentation when things change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I usually stick raw SQL in my applications so that I can control it myself.  It depends on your development team and philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

Much of the user data stored in this application must be encrypted (read HIPAA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past for projects that required encryption, I encrypted/decrypted in the application code.  However, this was generally for encrypting passwords or credit card information, so only a handful of columns in a couple tables.  For this application, far more columns in several tables need to be encrypted, so I suspect pushing the encryption responsibilities into the data layer will be better performing, especially given SQL Server 2005's native support for several encryption types.  (I could be convinced otherwise if anyone has real, empirical evidence.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've consulted BOL, and I'm fairly adept at using google.  So I don't want links to online articles or MSDN documentation (its likely I've already read it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One approach I've wrapped my head around so far is to use a symmetric key which is opened using a certificate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the one time setup steps are (performed by a DBA in theory):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a Master Key &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backup the Master Key to a file, burn to CD and store off site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the Master Key and create a certificate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backup the certificate to a file, burn to CD and store off site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create the Symmetric key with encryption algorithm of choice using the certificate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then anytime a stored procedure (or a human user via Management Studio) needs to access encrypted data you have to first open the symmetric key, execute any tsql statements or batches, and then close the symmetric key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then as far as the asp.net application is concerned, and in my case the application code's data access layer, the data encryption is entirely transparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my questions are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do I want to open, execute tsql statements/batches, and then close the symmetric key all within the sproc?  The danger I see is, what if something goes wrong with the tsql execution, and code sproc execution never reaches the statement that closes the key.  I assume this means the key will remain open until sql kills the SPID that sproc executed on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should I instead consider making three database calls for any given procedure I need to execute (only when encryption is necessary)?  One database call to open the key, a second call to execute the sproc, and a third call to close the key.  (Each call wrapped in its own try catch loop in order to maximize the odds that an open key ultimately is closed.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any considerations should I need to use client side transactions (meaning my code is the client, and initiates a transaction, executes several sprocs, and then commits the transaction assuming success)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt; that this is a general look at stored procedures not regulated to a specific
  DBMS. Some DBMS (and even, different
  versions of the same DBMS!) may operate
  contrary to this, so you'll want to
  double-check with your target DBMS
  before assuming all of this still holds.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I've been a Sybase ASE, MySQL, and SQL Server DBA on-and off since for almost a decade (along with application development in C, PHP, PL/SQL, C#.NET, and Ruby). So, I have no particular axe to grind in this (sometimes) holy war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The historical performance benefit of stored procs have generally been from the following (in no particular order):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre-parsed SQL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre-generated query execution plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduced network latency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potential cache benefits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-parsed SQL&lt;/strong&gt; -- similar benefits to compiled vs. interpreted code, except on a very micro level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still an advantage?&lt;/em&gt; 
Not very noticeable at all on the modern CPU, but if you are sending a single SQL statement that is VERY large eleventy-billion times a second, the parsing overhead can add up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-generated query execution plan&lt;/strong&gt;. 
If you have many JOINs the permutations can grow quite unmanageable (modern optimizers have limits and cut-offs for performance reasons). It is not unknown for very complicated SQL to have distinct, measurable (I've seen a complicated query take 10+ seconds just to generate a plan, before we tweaked the DBMS) latencies due to the optimizer trying to figure out the "near best" execution plan. Stored procedures will, generally, store this in memory so you can avoid this overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still an advantage?&lt;/em&gt; 
Most DBMS' (the latest editions) will cache the query plans for INDIVIDUAL SQL statements, greatly reducing the performance differential between stored procs and ad hoc SQL. There are some caveats and cases in which this isn't the case, so you'll need to test on your target DBMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, more and more DBMS allow you to provide optimizer path plans (abstract query plans) to significantly reduce optimization time (for both ad hoc and stored procedure SQL!!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING&lt;/strong&gt; Cached query plans are not a performance panacea. Occasionally the query plan that is generated is sub-optimal.
  For example, if you send &lt;code&gt;SELECT *
  FROM table WHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND
  99999999&lt;/code&gt;, the DBMS may select a
  full-table scan instead of an index
  scan because you're grabbing every row
  in the table (so sayeth the
  statistics). If this is the cached
  version, then you can get poor
  performance when you later send
  &lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM table WHERE id BETWEEN
  1 AND 2&lt;/code&gt;. The reasoning behind this is
  outside the scope of this posting, but
  for further reading see:
  &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/sql/2005/frcqupln.mspx"&gt;http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/sql/2005/frcqupln.mspx&lt;/a&gt;
  and

  &lt;p&gt;"In summary, they determined that
  supplying anything other than the
  common values when a compile or
  recompile was performed resulted in
  the optimizer compiling and caching
  the query plan for that particular
  value. Yet, when that query plan was
  reused for subsequent executions of
  the same query for the common values
  (M, R, or T), it resulted in
  sub-optimal performance. This
  sub-optimal performance problem
  existed until the query was
  recompiled. At that point, based on
  the @P1 parameter value supplied, the
  query might or might not have a
  performance problem."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced network latency&lt;/strong&gt;
A) If you are running the same SQL over and over -- and the SQL adds up to many KB of code -- replacing that with a simple "exec foobar" can really add up.
B) Stored procs can be used to move procedural code into the DBMS. This saves shuffling large amounts of data off to the client only to have it send a trickle of info back (or none at all!). Analogous to doing a JOIN in the DBMS vs. in your code (everyone's favorite WTF!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still an advantage?&lt;/em&gt;
A) Modern 1Gb (and 10Gb and up!) Ethernet really make this negligible. 
B) Depends on how saturated your network is -- why shove several megabytes of data back and forth for no good reason?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential cache benefits&lt;/strong&gt;
Performing server-side transforms of data can potentially be faster if you have sufficient memory on the DBMS and the data you need is in memory of the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still an advantage?&lt;/em&gt;
Unless your app has shared memory access to DBMS data, the edge will always be to stored procs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, no discussion of Stored Procedure optimization would be complete without a discussion of parameterized and ad hoc SQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parameterized / Prepared SQL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Kind of a cross between stored procedures and ad hoc SQL, they are embedded SQL statements in a host language that uses "parameters" for query values, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT .. FROM yourtable WHERE foo = ? AND bar = ?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These provide a more generalized version of a query that modern-day optimizers can use to cache (and re-use) the query execution plan, resulting in much of the performance benefit of stored procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ad Hoc SQL&lt;/strong&gt;
Just open a console window to your DBMS and type in a SQL statement. In the past, these were the "worst" performers (on average) since the DBMS had no way of pre-optimizing the queries as in the parameterized/stored proc method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still a disadvantage?&lt;/em&gt;
Not necessarily. Most DBMS have the ability to "abstract" ad hoc SQL into parameterized versions -- thus more or less negating the difference between the two. Some do this implicitly or must be enabled with a command setting (SQL server: &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175037.aspx"&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175037.aspx&lt;/a&gt; , Oracle: &lt;a href="http://www.praetoriate.com/oracle_tips_cursor_sharing.htm"&gt;http://www.praetoriate.com/oracle_tips_cursor_sharing.htm&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lessons learned?&lt;/strong&gt;
Moore's law continues to march on and DBMS optimizers, with every release, get more sophisticated. Sure, you can place every single silly teeny SQL statement inside a stored proc, but just know that the programmers working on optimizers are very smart and are continually looking for ways to improve performance. Eventually (if it's not here already) ad hoc SQL performance will become indistinguishable (on average!) from stored procedure performance, so any sort of &lt;em&gt;massive&lt;/em&gt; stored procedure use ** solely for "performance reasons"** sure sounds like premature optimization to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I think if you avoid the edge cases and have fairly vanilla SQL, you won't notice a difference between ad hoc and stored procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do have JUnit 4, and really don't want to use an IDE to run the tests, or want textual feedback, you can run the text UI test runner. In a similar vein as earlier, this can be done by entering on the command line[1]:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks DannySmurf, flushing the registry key was ultimately what needed to be done.  However, there were a few steps that I was missing before reaching that stage.  So, here's what came to light:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was using a RAM-based registry, where by design the registry does not persist after a cold boot.  I had to switch the registry to hive-based.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When switching to a hive-based registry structure, you need to make sure that the hive exists on a non-volatile medium.  This is specified in the platform.reg file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\init\BootVars]
"SystemHive"="\\Hard Disk\\system.hv"
"ProfileDir"="\\Documents and Settings"
"RegistryFlags"=dword:1               ; Flush hive on every RegCloseKey call
"SystemHiveInitialSize"=dword:19000   ; Initial size for hive-registry file 
"Start DevMgr"=dword:1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the system.hv file is on the hard disk (CF card in my case), the values in the registry will persist after a cold boot.  Note that the system.hv file contains all the HKLM keys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also important to note that any drivers that need to be initialized on boot have to be specified as such in the .reg files of the solution.  For example, I had to make sure that the hard disk drivers (PCMCIA) were loaded before trying to read the system hive file from them.  The way to do this is to add a directive in the following format around each driver init key:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;;HIVE BOOT SECTION
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Drivers\PCCARD\PCMCIA\TEMPLATE\PCMCIA]
  "Dll"="pcmcia.dll"
  "NoConfig"=dword:1
  "IClass"=multi_sz:"{6BEAB08A-8914-42fd-B33F-61968B9AAB32}=PCMCIA Card Services"
  "Flags"=dword:1000
;END HIVE BOOT SECTION
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, plus a lot of luck, is about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: 
Perhaps an example will help. Suppose we have a hierarchy of three classes &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt; in order of inheritance. 
&lt;code&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt; therefore has a base class &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; and a derived class &lt;code&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we can define a member function pointer &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; for class &lt;code&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt;. This is written as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void (Y::*p)();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(For simplicity, I'll assume we're only interested in functions with the signature &lt;code&gt;void f()&lt;/code&gt; )  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pointer &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; can now be used to point to member functions of class &lt;code&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question (two questions, really) is then:&lt;/p&gt;

It depends on the kind of application and the kind of users you have. Without knowing what the system is and the scope of the changes in the version, it is difficult to offer an answer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, there are some rules of thumb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, avoid the big bang launch. Any launch of a system is going to have problems. The industry is littered with projects where people thought the bang-bang launch was a great idea, only for teething problems to bring the launch to its knees. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Patterson" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cuil&lt;/a&gt; was a recent high-profile causality of the big-bang launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to make the teething problems manageable, you need to work with small numbers of users initially, then slowly ratchet up the number of users. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the thing that you must absolutely must positively do is &lt;em&gt;put the user first&lt;/em&gt;. The user should have to do the least amount of work possible to use V2 of the system. The ideal amount of work would be zero. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that if you pick to slowly migrate users from one system to the other, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are responsible for making sure all their data and settings are migrated. For example, don't do anything stupid like telling the user they must use V1 for all records before 12/09/2008 and V2 for all records after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of releasing V2 should be making the users' life easier, not making it needlessly more difficult. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, have a beta program. This applies even for Intranet applications. Developing an application is much like Newton-Raphson's method for finding the root of a polynomial. You make a guess of what the user wants, you deliver it to the user, the user provides feedback and slowly but surely each iteration takes you closer to the solution to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A beta program will help you find the root much faster than just foisting new versions on to people without time for them to comment on the changes. Betas help get your users on-board earlier and make them feel included in the process; the importance of which I can not stress enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problems with VSS have nothing to do with this example (although the "Labeling" feature I believe is implemented inefficiently...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few of the issues with VSS &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Branching is basically impossible
2) Shared checkout is generally not used (I know of a few people who have had success with it)
3) performance is very poor - it is exteremly "chatty"
4) unless you have a very small repository - it is completely unreliable, to the point for most shops it's a ticking timebomb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 4 - the problem is that VSS is implemented by the entire repository being represented as "flat files" in the file system.  When the repository gets over a certain size (I believe 4GB but I'm not confident in that figure) you get a chance for "corruption".  As the size increases the chances of corruption grow until it becomes an almost certainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So take a look at your repository size - and if you are getting into the Gigabytes - I'd strongly recommend you begin planning on replacing VSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless - a google of "VSS Sucks" gives 30K hits...  I think if you did start using an alterantive - you will realize it's well worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The documentation doesn't seem to mention performance of &lt;code&gt;random.sample&lt;/code&gt;. From a really quick empirical test with a huge list and a huge set, it seems to be constant time for a list but not for the set. Also, iteration over a set isn't random; the order is undefined but predictable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; list(set(range(10))) == range(10)

&lt;p&gt;If randomness is important and you need a bunch of elements in constant time (large sets), I'd use &lt;code&gt;random.sample&lt;/code&gt; and convert to a list first:&lt;/p&gt;

It's like remodeling a house: getting it over with seems like a good idea initially.  But means you have to plan everything upfront, hire a bunch of contractors and move out.  Then something changes in the plan or a contractor disappears, and all that time you hoped to save is gone.  Meanwhile, gradual change gives everyone a chance to stop and think between steps.  Sometimes you can avoid later changes when earlier changes work out better than you planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work on a system that had a huge scaling problem.  We made a list of all the changes we thought we'd need and prioritized them by probable impact.  Then we started making one change at a time.  About half-way through the list, we found we'd solved the scaling problem.  I still have the list, but I may never need to finish it.  I'm free to add features and solve other problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are times when it's best to bit the bullet and tear the whole thing down.  But that's a lot less common than people tend to believe.  And for critical operational systems, the "tear-down" decision can be fatal.  Look at the big government projects that everyone agrees have to be brought to the modern computing era, but can't because some vital service will be lost.  If the philosophy had been gradual change, maybe they would have been modernized one piece at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

So let's say a class instantiates another class, that class instance is now referenced with an object. From that child object, what is the best way to reference back to the parent object? Currently I know of a couple ways that I use often, but I'm not sure if A) there is a better way to do it or B) which of them is the better practice&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first method is to use getDefinitionByName, which would not instantiate that class, but allow access to anything inside of it that was publicly declared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;_class:Class = getDefinitionByName("com.site.Class") as Class;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then reference that variable based on its parent to child hierarchy.&lt;br /&gt;
Example, if the child is attempting to reference a class that's two levels up from itself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;_class(parent.parent).function();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to work fine, but you are required to know the level at which the child is at compared to the level of the parent you are attempting to access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can also get the following statement to trace out [object ClassName] into Flash's output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;trace(Class);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not 100% on the implementation of that line, I haven't persued it as a way to reference an object outside of the current object I'm in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another method I've seen used is to simply pass a reference to this into the class object you are creating and just catch it with a constructor argument&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var class:Class = new Class(this);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then in the Class file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public function Class(objectRef:Object) {
    _parentRef = objectRef;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That reference also requires you to step back up using the child to parent hierarchy though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could also import that class, and then use the direct filepath to reference a method inside of that class, regardless of its the parent or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import com.site.Class;
com.site.Class.method();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there the parent to child relationship is irrelevant because I'm accessing the method or property directly through the imported class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just feel like I'm missing something really obvious here. I'm basically looking for confirmation if these are the correct ways to reference the parent, and if so which is the most ideal, or am I over-looking something else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance for taking the time to help a newbie out!&lt;/p&gt;

If set to "DEBUG" you would see every event, no matter how trivial. If you set it to "FATAL" you'd only see the events that that were "System Failure" in magnitude. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are still too many events, you may want to sub-divide your events in to some sort of category system. Again, I would have this as a query string parameter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the ones that never change, like Christmas, it's easy - December 25th. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the ones that do change somewhat, there's usually a formula - like the third Monday in February being Presidents Day. You can just have the method figure this out for a given year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This won't work for holidays without any particular pattern (i.e., some committee decides what the date is every year) but for all the major ones there's easily discernible formulas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would actually be a great candidate for Test Driven Design. You will know all of the major holiday dates for a particular year, so you should be able to feed that year into the method and get the right answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be rather easier if you had the binary representation of the number.  Are the numbers being converted from rationals or scientific notation earlier in your program?  If so, you could skip the earlier conversion and have a much easier time.  Otherwise you might want to pass each number to a function in an external DLL written in C, where you could work with the floating point representation directly.  Or you could cast the numbers to decimal and do some work with &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.decimal.getbits(VS.71).aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;Decimal.GetBits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fastest approach I can think of in-place and following your conditions would be to find the smallest necessary power-of-ten (or 2, or whatever) as suggested before.  But instead of doing it in a loop, save some computation by doing binary search on the possible powers.  Assuming a maximum of 8, something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int NumDecimals( double d )
{
   // make d positive for clarity; it won't change the result
   if( d&amp;lt;0 ) d=-d;

   // now do binary search on the possible numbers of post-decimal digits to 
   // determine the actual number as quickly as possible:

   if( NeedsMore( d, 10e4 ) )
   {
      // more than 4 decimals
      if( NeedsMore( d, 10e6 ) )
      {
          // &amp;gt; 6 decimal places
          if( NeedsMore( d, 10e7 ) ) return 10e8;
          return 10e7;
      }
      else
      {
         // &amp;lt;= 6 decimal places
         if( NeedsMore( d, 10e5 ) ) return 10e6;
         return 10e5;
      }
   }
   else
   {
      // &amp;lt;= 4 decimal places
      // etc...
   }

}

bool NeedsMore( double d, double e )
{
   // check whether the representation of D has more decimal points than the 
   // power of 10 represented in e.
   return (d*e - Math.Floor( d*e )) &amp;gt; 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Depending on what you want to do, there are various sizes of target to consider. Use Atmel AVR for small low power (battery) stuff. Perhapse use Linux on an old laptop if I just wanted to rough out the concept and needed WiFi (or cellular) for internet.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The laptop Linux prototype then could be trimmed down and ported to an embedded Cinux system for even lower battery usage and portability later on. (not as low as Atmel though).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Foreach is for iterating over
  collections that implement
  IEnumerable. It does this by calling
  GetEnumerator on the collection, which
  will return an Enumerator.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;This Enumerator has a method and a
  property:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;* MoveNext()
* Current
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Current returns the object that
  Enumerator is currently on, MoveNext
  updates Current to the next object.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Obviously, the concept of an index is
  foreign to the concept of enumeration,
  and cannot be done.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Because of that, most collections are
  able to be traversed using an indexer
  and the for loop construct.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I greatly prefer using a for loop in
  this situation compared to tracking
  the index with a local variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class Combos {
    public static void main() {
        long counter = 0;

        for (int a = 0; a &amp;lt;= 500; a++) {
            for (int b = 0; b &amp;lt;= (500 - a); b++) {

            }
        }
        System.out.println(counter);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which returns 2656615626.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Order Does Not Matter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If the order does not matter then the solution is not that much harder as you just need to make sure that zero isn't possible unless sum has already been found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class Combos {
    public static void main() {
        long counter = 0;

        for (int a = 1; a &amp;lt;= 500; a++) {
            for (int b = (a != 500) ? 1 : 0; b &amp;lt;= (500 - a); b++) {
                for (int c = (a + b != 500) ? 1 : 0; c &amp;lt;= (500 - a - b); c++) {
                    for (int d = (a + b + c != 500) ? 1 : 0; d &amp;lt;= (500 - a - b - c); d++) {

&lt;p&gt;However, you can use IIS to do this, if your using IIS 5.1, download the MS IIS toolpack for IIS 6.0, it comes with a tool to create self signed SSL certificates. This works on IIS 5.1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=56fc92ee-a71a-4c73-b628-ade629c89499&amp;amp;DisplayLang=en"&gt;http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=56fc92ee-a71a-4c73-b628-ade629c89499&amp;amp;DisplayLang=en&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one tool you need (SelfSSL.exe) works just fine with IIS 5.1. Unfortunately, it comes bundled with a bunch of other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the IIS Tools File. If you want, you can click Custom and tell it to only install SelfSSL. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activate the site in IIS that you want to install a SSL certificate too. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to Start / Programs / IIS Resources / SelfSSL &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This will launch a command prompt in the SelfSSL directory. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the provided help, run SelfSSL. The command I used was: selfssl.exe /N:cn=[MACHINENAME] /K:1024 /V:90 
/S:5 /P:443 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The /S switch indicates which site to install the certificate. You can figure out the number by looking at your sites in IIS and counting (Starting at 1 for the first site, not 0), to the site you want. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once this has ran, browse to your localhost over HTTPS &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should receive an error message stating that this certificate is from a untrusted source. You can either add your machinename to the browsers Trusted Authorities list, or you can tell the browser to ignore this. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, you will be able to run your localhost over HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;const has a funny way of propagating through your code. Thus, it's a really good idea to start using const as early and as often as possible. Deciding to start const-ifying your code late in the game can be painful (easy, but annoying).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've learnt from experience that making code simple makes it easier for the compiler to optimise it. The larger the method, the harder the compiler has to work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've also recently seen a problem where large methods have caused a memory leak. Basically I had a loop very much like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
while (true)
{
  var smallObject = WaitForSomethingToTurnUp();
  var largeObject = DoSomethingWithSmallObject();
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was finding that my application was keeping a large amount of data in memory because even though 'largeObject' wasn't in scope until smallObject returned something, the garbage collector could still see it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I easily solved this by moving the 'DoSomethingWithSmallObject()' and other associated code to another method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you make small methods, your reuse within a class will become significantly higher. I generally try to make sure that none of my methods look like any others!&lt;/p&gt;

Within this sector is a magnetic pattern (a strip) which encodes the bits of data stored in the sector. This pattern is written by a write head which is more or less stationary while the disk rotates beneath it. Now, in order for your hard drive to function properly as a data storage device each time a new magnetic pattern strip is written to a sector it has to reset the magnetic pattern in that sector enough to be readable later. However, it doesn't have to completely erase all evidence of the previous magnetic pattern, it just has to be good enough (and with the amount of error correction used today good enough doesn't have to be all that good). Consider that the write head will not always take the same track as the previous pass over a given sector (it could be skewed a little to the left or the right, it could pass over the sector at a slight angle one way or the other due to vibration, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you get is a series of layers of magnetic patterns, with the strongest pattern corresponding to the last data write.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can one import existing xml into a SQL 2005 database, without relying on the built-in xml type?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fairly straight forward solution that you already mentioned is the &lt;em&gt;sp_xml_preparedocument&lt;/em&gt;, combined with &lt;em&gt;openxml&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully the following example illustrates the correct usage. For a more complete example checkout the MSDN docs on &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms187897(SQL.90).aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;Using OPENXML&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;declare @XmlDocumentHandle int
declare @XmlDocument nvarchar(1000)
set @XmlDocument = N'&amp;lt;ROOT&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;Customer&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;FirstName&amp;gt;Will&amp;lt;/FirstName&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;LastName&amp;gt;Smith&amp;lt;/LastName&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/Customer&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ROOT&amp;gt;'

-- Create temp table to insert data into
create table #Customer 
( 
    FirstName varchar(20),
    LastName varchar(20) 
)
-- Create an internal representation of the XML document.
exec sp_xml_preparedocument @XmlDocumentHandle output, @XmlDocument

-- Insert using openxml allows us to read the structure
insert into #Customer
select 
    FirstName = XmlFirstName,
    LastName = XmlLastName
from openxml ( @XmlDocumentHandle, '/ROOT/Customer',2 )
with 
(
    XmlFirstName  varchar(20) 'FirstName',
    XmlLastName varchar(20) 'LastName'
)
where ( XmlFirstName = 'Will' and XmlLastName = 'Smith' )

-- Cleanup xml document
exec sp_xml_removedocument @XmlDocumentHandle

-- Show the data
select * 
from #Customer

-- Drop tmp table
drop table #Customer
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an xml file and are using C#, then defining a stored procedure that does something like the above and then passing the entire xml file contents to the stored procedure as a &lt;em&gt;string&lt;/em&gt; should give you a fairly straight forward way of importing xml into your existing table(s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically they create a custom field in the document library and use event receivers to keep the current version of the document in this field.
The "trick" is that on the client side this custom field shows up as a property of the document the value of which you can easily embed into the document's contents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure why changing the field won't increase the version of the document, but I guess it is because you're only changing metadata, not the actual document. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They do use a little VBA script which runs on the client side, but it doesn't require any client side deployment as it is downloaded with the document. However I'm not sure if any security settings changes on the client side may be needed to allow the script to run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only does this protect against SQL injection, it also speeds up queries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by using PDO rather than &lt;code&gt;mysql_&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;mysqli_&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;pgsql_&lt;/code&gt; functions, you make your app a little more abstracted from the database, in the rare occurrence that you have to switch database providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you want is one of these three things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncle.childid can be null, and you want ON DELETE SET NULL for childid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncle.childid cannot be null, and you want ON DELETE CASCADE for childid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Childid does not belong on Uncle, and you want a ChildsUncle relation with ON DELETE CASCADE foreign key constraints to both Child and Uncle. Uncleid would be a candidate key for that relation (i.e. it should be unique).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reuse is a side-effect of an good design and proper level of abstraction.  Code achieves reuse by doing something useful, but not doing so much as to make it inflexible.  It does not matter whether the code is OO or not - we reuse what works and is not trivial to do ourselves.  That's pragmatism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thought of OO as a new way to get to reuse through inheritance is fundamentally flawed.  As you note the LSP violations abound.  Instead, OO is properly thought of as a method of managing the complexity of a problem domain.  The goal is maintainability of a system over time.  The primary tool for achieving this is the separation of public interface from a private implementation.  This allows us to have rules like "This should only be modified using ..." enforced by the compiler, rather than code review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this, I'm sure you will agree, allows us to create and maintain hugely complex systems.  There is lots of value in that, and it is not easy to do in other paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;

It sounds "right", but I'm just not getting how I convert the roles to a decimal before it goes in the db, and how it gets converted back when it comes out of the db. I'm using Java, but if you stubbed it out, that would be cool as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the original answer in the off chance the other question gets deleted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Personally, I sometimes use a flagged enumeration of permissions. This way you can use AND, OR, NOT and XOR bitwise operations on the enumeration's items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Flags]
public enum Permission
{
    VIEWUSERS = 1, // 2^0 // 0000 0001
    EDITUSERS = 2, // 2^1 // 0000 0010
    VIEWPRODUCTS = 4, // 2^2 // 0000 0100
    EDITPRODUCTS = 8, // 2^3 // 0000 1000
    VIEWCLIENTS = 16, // 2^4 // 0001 0000
    EDITCLIENTS = 32, // 2^5 // 0010 0000
    DELETECLIENTS = 64, // 2^6 // 0100 0000
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, you can combine several permissions using the AND bitwise operator. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if a user can view &amp;amp; edit users, the binary result of the operation is 0000 0011 which converted to decimal is 3. 
You can then store the permission of one user into a single column of your DataBase (in our case it would be 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside your application, you just need another bitwise operation (OR) to verify if a user has a particular permission or not."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are going to do something like this, you'll really benefit from having a  &lt;a href="http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/1184" rel="nofollow"&gt;numbers table&lt;/a&gt;. It will make your calculations much faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic setup includes the following tables:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Groups - for doing many to many of users and security points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security points - which contain a value for anonymous authorization and one for authenticated users who are not part of a separate group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Group security point  join table &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A special BitMask numbers table that contains entries for the ^2 values. Thus there is one entry for 2 (2) and two entries for three (2 and 1). This keeps us from having to calculate values each time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we determine if the user is logged in. If they aren't we return the anonymous authorization for the security point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we determine if the user is a member of any groups associated with the security point through a simple &lt;code&gt;EXISTS&lt;/code&gt; using a &lt;code&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt;. If they aren't we return the value associated with authenticated user. Most of the anonymous and authenticated defaults are set to 1 on our system because we require you to belong to specific groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; If an anonymous user gets a no access, the interface throws them over to a log in box to allow them to log in and try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the user &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a member of one or more groups, then we select distinct values from the BitMask table for each of the values defined for the groups. For example, if you belonged to three groups and had one authorization level of 8, one with 12 and the last with 36, our select against the Bit Mask table would return 8, 8 and 4, and 4 and 32 respectively. By doing a distinct we get the number 4, 8 and 32 which correctly bit masks to 101100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That value is returned as the users authorization level and processed by the web site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sense?&lt;/p&gt;

(define-isearch-yank (kbd "C-. t") "^.*Table\\(\\(.*\\n\\)*?GO\\)")
(define-isearch-yank (kbd "&amp;lt;f6&amp;gt;") "HELLO WORLD")
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key combos now only work in isearch mode. You start the search normally, and then press key combos to insert your predefined string.&lt;/p&gt;

If I try to directly access one that I created with localhost/index.html, I get "the request URL was not found on the server." So, I'm not even sure where that page is coming from.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class SMTP:
    def lookupMethod(self, command):
        return getattr(self, 'do_' + command.upper(), None)
    def do_HELO(self, rest):
        return 'Howdy ' + rest
    def do_QUIT(self, rest):
        return 'Bye'

SMTP().lookupMethod('HELO')('foo.bar.com') # =&amp;gt; 'Howdy foo.bar.com'
SMTP().lookupMethod('QUIT')('') # =&amp;gt; 'Bye'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use it any time you need to dispatch on a token and execute extended piece of code. In a state machine you would have &lt;code&gt; state_ &lt;/code&gt; methods, and dispatch on &lt;code&gt;self.state&lt;/code&gt;. This switch can be cleanly extended by inheriting from base class and defining your own &lt;code&gt; do_ &lt;/code&gt; methods. Often times you won't even have &lt;code&gt; do_ &lt;/code&gt; methods in the base class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit: how exactly is that used&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case of SMTP you will receive &lt;code&gt;HELO&lt;/code&gt; from the wire. The relevant code (from &lt;code&gt;twisted/mail/smtp.py&lt;/code&gt;, modified for our case) looks like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class SMTP:
    # ...

    def do_UNKNOWN(self, rest):
        raise NotImplementedError, 'received unknown command'

    def state_COMMAND(self, line):
        line = line.strip()
        parts = line.split(None, 1)
        if parts:
            method = self.lookupMethod(parts[0]) or self.do_UNKNOWN
            if len(parts) == 2:
                return method(parts[1])
            else:
                return method('')
        else:
            raise SyntaxError, 'bad syntax'

SMTP().state_COMMAND('   HELO   foo.bar.com  ') # =&amp;gt; Howdy foo.bar.com
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll receive &lt;code&gt;'  HELO   foo.bar.com '&lt;/code&gt; (or you might get &lt;code&gt;'QUIT'&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;'RCPT TO: foo'&lt;/code&gt;). This is tokenized into &lt;code&gt;parts&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;['HELO', 'foo.bar.com']&lt;/code&gt;. The actual method lookup name is taken from &lt;code&gt;parts[0]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The original method is also called &lt;code&gt;state_COMMAND&lt;/code&gt;, because it uses the same pattern to implement a state machine, i.e. &lt;code&gt;getattr(self, 'state_' + self.mode)&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

With char, you reserve the entire space in advance.So let's says you have a char(1000), and you store 10 characters, you will use up all 1000 charaters of space. In a varchar2(1000), you will only use 10 characters. The problem comes when you modify the data. Let's say you update the column to now contain 900 characters. It is possible that the space to expand the varchar is not available in the current block. In that case, the DB engine must migrate the row to another block, and make a pointer in the original block to the new row in the new block. To read this data, the DB engine will now have to read 2 blocks.&lt;br&gt;
No one can equivocally say that varchar or char are better. There is a space for time tradeoff, and consideration of whether the data will be updated, especially if there is a good chance that it will grow.&lt;/p&gt;

I think ugliness is okay as long as they are contained, but the moment when they start having the urge to spread, that's when you need to take care of business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The techniques you use for refactoring should start with the simplest. I would strongly recommand Martin Fowler's book. Combining common code into functions, removing unneeded variables, and other simple techniques gets you a lot of mileage. For list operations, I prefer using functional programming idioms. That is to say, I use internal iterators, map, filter and reduce(in python speak, there are corresponding things in ruby, lisp and haskell) whenever I can, this makes code a lot shorter and more self-contained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my personal experience my favorite "way of removing repetition" has been the "Extract Method" functionality of Resharper (although this is also available in vanilla Visual Studio).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many times I would see repeated code (some legacy app I'm maintaining) not as whole methods but in chunks within completely separate methods. That gives a perfect opportunity to turn those chunks into methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monster classes also tend to reveal that they contain more than one functionality. That in turn becomes an opportunity to separate each distinct functionality into its own (hopefully smaller) class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to reiterate that doing all of these is not a pleasurable experience at all (for me), so I really would rather do it right while it's a small ball of mud, rather than let the big ball of mud roll and then try to fix that.&lt;/p&gt;

The interface is written in Objective-C, and most of it is not even part of WebKit (so you can't see the source), but there's machinery to inspect and patch the object hierarchy of a running application. It requires understanding of Cocoa and Objective-C, but no lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a high level overview I had in my bookmarks of the process &lt;a href="http://livingcode.org/2006/tab-dumping-in-safari" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://livingcode.org/2006/tab-dumping-in-safari&lt;/a&gt;. It goes over creating Safari plugins using Python with working (probably outdated) code. Instead of Python you can use anything that has Objective-C bindings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two major parts to it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to attach your code to a running Safari. This is typically done with SIMBL &lt;a href="http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you're inside, you need to figure what to patch. There's a tutorial on reversing Cocoa applications &lt;a href="http://www.culater.net/wiki/moin.cgi/CocoaReverseEngineering" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.culater.net/wiki/moin.cgi/CocoaReverseEngineering&lt;/a&gt;, which links to the most important tool, class-dump &lt;a href="http://www.codethecode.com/projects/class-dump/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.codethecode.com/projects/class-dump/&lt;/a&gt; (the link on wiki is broken). Class-dump gives you a complete hierarchy of Safari's classes, where you can guess by names what, specifically, you need to patch. This is a very trial and error mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading the links above will give you the scope of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately it's true there is no easy way to create draggable tab panes (or any other components) in Swing.  So whilst the example above is complete this one I've just written is a bit simpler. So it will hopefully demonstrate the more advanced techniques involved a bit clearer.  The steps are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detect that a drag has occurred&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draw the dragged tab to an offscreen buffer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track the mouse position whilst dragging occurs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draw the tab in the buffer on top of the component.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above example will give you what you want but if you want to really understand the techniques applied here it might be a better exercise to round off the edges of this example and add the extra features demonstrated above to it.&lt;/p&gt;

Also, if you specify the wrong character set in your META headers, your browser will render the page incorrectly, causing moji-bake again, sometimes in random places on the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When handling CJK character sets, you must be sure to use UTF8 character encoding throughout the lifetime of your program (data storage, retrieval, data manipulation in your code, displaying in the browsser etc...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is UTF8?&lt;/strong&gt;
UTF8 handles binary streams of data, not strings. This means the bit combinations can have variable length. ASCII characters have a fixed length of 8 bits representing 1 byte, however UTF8 characters can be composed of 6bits, 8bits, 12bits, etc... As such, UTF8 is prone to what Japanese call "mojibake".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a coder, from database to codebase to browser, you should try and use UTF8 completely. For email you can use UTF8, but you will probably find most mail servers and clients are still old and use a mishmash of different character sets (e.g. ISO9022X).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Database Settings&lt;/strong&gt;
If you are a mysql user, then make sure you have to ensure all connections to the DB use UTF8, and that all tables/fields use UTF8. By default mysql uses Latin (Swedish) character sets. Those kooky swedes love their sense of humour!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Checking your Codebase&lt;/strong&gt;
In my experience editors like Notepad++, Notepad2, UltraEdit, e, etc... all have UTF8 support problems. They mostly work, but since their developers don't use CJK languages themselves, they are not perfected. Issues like turning off BOM (Byte Order Mark), mangled tabs, poor character set conversion, etc ... all present problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend using a proven UTF8 editor like Maruo. This is made by a Japanese company, but there is an English version (and a trial version) at &lt;a href="http://hide.maruo.co.jp/software/bin/maruo614_signed.exe" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://hide.maruo.co.jp/software/bin/maruo614_signed.exe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, you may need to convert your source files into UTF8. Especially if the codebase itself has CJK language strings contained therein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manipulating Strings&lt;/strong&gt;
Any string function need to multibyte safe. Notice I didn't say double-byte. UTF8 is not a double byte but multibyte, depending on the total number of bits used to represent a character. In PHP you need to call the MB string functions specifically. Ruby and other languages have more transparent support, but you need to check the docs for your flavour of application server!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;META Tags&lt;/strong&gt;
Check out google.co.jp or yahoo.co.jp for their META headers. These are sites that know how to to it properly. Basically include the following META tag the doucment &amp;lt;HEAD&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is usually safe to mix English HTML document type attributes with the above character too. So adding the META tag above seems to work in a HTML document that has:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en"&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Email&lt;/strong&gt;
This is a wholly different can of worms. UTF8 works a lot, but many older Japanese clients use ISO2022X more. This is not worth covering here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debugging UTF8 Issues&lt;/strong&gt;
Once you have a reliable UTF8 editor like Maruo, you can create static pages and resolve your issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hope that helps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

However, there are many subtleties in this field, one of which is that locked blocks of code are automatically marked as &lt;strong&gt;critical regions&lt;/strong&gt; by the Common Language Runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effect of code being marked as critical is that, if the entire region cannot be entirely executed, the runtime may consider that your entire Application Domain is potentially jeopardized and, therefore, unload it from memory. To quote &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.thread.begincriticalregion.aspx"&gt;MSDN&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For example, consider a task that attempts to allocate memory while holding a lock. If the memory allocation fails, aborting the current task is not sufficient to ensure stability of the AppDomain, because there can be other tasks in the domain waiting for the same lock. If the current task is terminated, other tasks could be deadlocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, even though your application is single-threaded, this may be a hazard for you. Consider that one method in a locked block throws an exception that is eventually not handled within the block. Even if the exception is dealt as it bubbles up through the call stack, your critical region of code didn't finish normally. And who knows how the CLR will react?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) I haven't seen anything regarding MVC specifically geared towards ASP, but I'm definitely interested because it's something I'm having a tough time wrapping my head around. I generally try to at least contain things which are view-like and things which are controller-like in separate functions. I suppose you could possibly write code in separate files and then use server side includes to join them all back together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) You're probably coming from a language which has more functionality built in. At first, some things may appear to be missing, but it's often just a matter of writing a lot more lines of code than you're used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the code was written/maintained by various people, there might be some issues with inconsistent coding style. I find that bringing the code back into line makes it easier to see things that can be refactored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many pieces; I'll try to go over them one by one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impersonation&lt;/strong&gt; is a technique to "temporarily" switch the user account under which a thread is running. Essentially, the thread briefly gains the same rights and access -- no more, no less -- as the account that is being impersonated. As soon as the thread is done creating the web page, it "reverts" back to the original account and gets ready for the next call. This technique is used to access resources that only the user logged into your web site has access to. Hold onto the concept for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, by default ASP.NET runs a web site under a local account called &lt;strong&gt;ASPNET&lt;/strong&gt;. Again, by default, only the ASPNET account and members of the Administrators group can write to that folder. Your temporary folder is under that account's purview. This is the second piece of the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impersonation doesn't happen on its own. It needs to be turn on intentionally in your web.config.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;identity impersonate="true" /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the setting is missing or set to false, your code will execute pure and simply under the ASPNET account mentioned above. Given your error message, I'm positive that you have impersonation=true. There is nothing wrong with that! Impersonation has advantages and disadvantages that go beyond this discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one question left: when you use impersonation, &lt;em&gt;which account gets impersonated&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you specify the account in the web.config (&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/72wdk8cc.aspx"&gt;full syntax of the identity element here&lt;/a&gt;), the account impersonated is the one that the IIS handed over to ASP.NET. And that depends on how the user has authenticated (or not) into the site. That is your third and final piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IUSR_ComputerName account is a low-rights account created by IIS. By default, this account is the account under which a web call runs &lt;strong&gt;if the user could not be authenticated&lt;/strong&gt;. That is, the user comes in as an "anonymous".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, this is what is happening to you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your user is trying to access the web site, and IIS could not authenticate the person for some reason. Because Anonymous access is ON, (or you would not see IUSRComputerName accessing the temp folder), IIS allows the user in anyway, but as a generic user. Your ASP.NET code runs and impersonates this generic IUSR___ComputerName "guest" account; only now the code doesn't have access to the things that the ASPNET account had access to, including its own temporary folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granting IUSR_ComputerName WRITE access to the folder makes your symptoms go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that just the symptoms. You need to review &lt;strong&gt;why is the person coming as "Anonymous/Guest"?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two likely scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) You intended to use IIS for authentication, but the authentication settings in IIS for some of your servers are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that case, you need to disable Anonymous access on those servers so that the usual authentication mechanisms take place. Note that you might still need to grant to your users access to that temporary folder, or use another folder instead, one to which your users already have access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have worked with this scenario many times, and quite frankly it gives you less headaches to forgo the Temp folder; create a dedicated folder in the server, set the proper permissions, and set its location in web.config. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) You didn't want to authenticate people anyway, or you wanted to use ASP.NET Forms Authentication (which uses IIS's Anonymous access to bypass checks in IIS and lets ASP.NET handle the authentication directly)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case is a bit more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should go to IIS and disable all forms of authentication other than "Anonymous Access". Note that you can't do that in the developer's box, because the debugger needs Integrated Authentication to be enabled. So your debugging box will behave a bit different than the real server; just be aware of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, you need to decide whether you should turn impersonation OFF, or conversely, to specify the account to impersonate in the web.config. Do the first if your web server doesn't need outside resources (like a database). Do the latter if your web site does need to run under an account that has access to a database (or some other outside resource).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have two more alternatives to specify the account to impersonate. One, you could go to IIS and change the "anonymous" account to be one with access to the resource instead of the one IIS manages for you. The second alternative is to stash the account and password encrypted in the registry. That step is a bit complicated and also goes beyond the scope of this discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

There, you can centralize the task of injecting event handling into form controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By that, I mean that you won't need to insert event handlers into the HTML form code. Instead, you register those events from somewhere else. For example, in Prototype you would be able to write something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$('myFormControl').observe('click', myClickFunction)

&lt;p&gt;Pretend for a minute you were going to set up transaction infrastructure anyways where:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever a call to the datastore was about to be made if an existing transaction hadn't been started then one was created.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a transaction is already in place then calls to the data store hook into that transaction. This is often useful for business rules that are raised by save/going-to-the-database events. IE. If you had a rule that whenever you sold a widget you needed to update a WidgetAudit table, you'd probably want to wrap the widget audit insert call in the same transaction as that which is telling the datastore a widget has been sold.   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever a the original caller to the datastore (from step 1) is finished it commits/rollbacks the transaction, which affects all the database actions which happened during its call (using a try/catch/finally).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this type of transactioning is created then it becomes simple to tack on a open key at the beginning (when the transaction opens) and close the key at the end (just before the transaction ends). Making "calls" to the datastore isn't nearly as expensive as opening a connection to the database. It's really things like SQLConnection.Open() that burns resources (even if ADO.NET is pooling them for you).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want an example of these types of codes I would consider looking at NetTiers. It has quite an elegant solution for the transactioning that we just described (assuming you don't already have something in mind).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just 2 cents. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

However I have worked with COM and type libraries for quite some time and here are my general gotchas that I have found over the years.  I would agree its pretty buggy and is all the way up to Delphi 2006 (our version prior to using 2009).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always have every file writeable before opening.  This may sound obvious, but when working with source control sometimes we forget to do this and try to remove readonly flag after opening a file - Delphi cant deal with this.  Ensure tlb is writable before opening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If editing a standalone typelibrary you MUST have a project open.  For some reason if you open a type library on its own it will not save.  Create a blank project and then open your typelibrary.  For some reason this allows the type library to be saved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your type library is used by an application or COM+ ensure that application is shut down or COM+ disabled before opening the type library.  Any open apps will prevent the type library from being saved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I think your best solution is probably an upgrade. You get Unicode support too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rather doubt you'll find a service to build stuff for you. Building requires a lot of CPU power, and if you're having to rebuild every time someone commits, it would be hard to scale such a service.. And I'm sure there's probably security issues and the likes as well..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As @eed3si9n said, you could run CruiseControl on a spare (virtual-)machine and use that. Then setup port forwarding, and something like &lt;a href="http://dyndns.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://dyndns.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://no-ip.info" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://no-ip.info&lt;/a&gt; to make it publicly accessible. It's not ideal..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've never used CruiseControl before, but I imagine there will be a way to take the build results, and upload them to a public web-server (as a dumb HTML file). That way it would sit on your home machine, watching github, building new versions and sending the results to a reliable web-host (so no "Connection Timeout" every time your home connection isn't accessible)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I just looked at the CruiseControl documentation - the build results are stored as a set of XML files, so it'd be trivial to transfer/display them on another machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, my suggestion is: run the continuous integration server on a spare machine, have it upload the results to a public web server somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I too inherited a classic ASP system that was slapped together willy-nilly by ex excel-vba types. There was a lot of this stuff &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;font size=3&amp;gt;crap&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (and sometimes missing closing tags; Argggh!). Over the course of 2.5 years I added a security system, a common library, CSS+XHTML and was able to coerce the thing to validate xhtml1.1 (sans proper mime type, unfortunately) and built a fairly robust and ajaxy reporting system that's being used daily by 80 users. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used jEdit, with cTags (as mentioned by &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/2639/jamting" rel="nofollow"&gt;jamting&lt;/a&gt; above), and a bunch of other plugins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Advice&lt;/strong&gt;
Try to create a master include file from which to import all the stuff that's commonly used. Stuff like login/logout, database access, web services, javascript libs, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do use classes. They are ultra-primitive (no inheritance) but as jamting said, they can be convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indent the scripts properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write an external architecture document. I personally use LyX, because it's brain-dead to produce a nicely formatted pdf, but you can use whatever you like. If you use a wiki, get the graphviz add-in installed and use it. It's super easy to make quick diagrams that can be easily modified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I have no idea how substantial the enhancements need to be, I suggest having a good high-level to mid-level architecture document will be quite useful in planning the enhancements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the business logic unit tests, the only thing I found that works is setting up an xml-rpc listener in asp that imports the main library and exposes the functions (not subroutines though) in any of the main library's sub-includes, and then build, separately, a unit test system in a language with better support for the stuff that calls the ASP functions through xml-rpc. I use python, but I think Ruby should do the trick. (Does that make sense?). The cool thing is that the person writing the unit-test part of the software does not need to even look at the ASP code, as long as they have decent descriptions of the functions to call, so they can be someone beside you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a project called &lt;a href="http://aspunit.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow"&gt;aspunit&lt;/a&gt; at sourceforge but the last release was in 2004 and it's marked as inactive. Never used it but it's pure vbscript. A cursory look at the code tells me it looks like the authors knew what they were doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you need help, I have some availability to do contract telecommuting work (maybe 8 hours/week max). Follow the link trail for contact info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck! HTH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I was wondering how, and if it was possible to include a function inside a variable.
I know I could just write:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?php

&lt;p&gt;But what if I have a long variable for output, and I don't want to do that every time, or I want to use multiple functions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?php
    $var1 = &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF

      -somefunc() doesn't work
      -{somefunc()} doesn't work
      -$somefunc() and {$somefunc()} doesn't work of course because a function needs to be a string
      -more non-working: ${somefunc()}
     &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
EOF;
?&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or I want dynamic changes in that load of code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?
    function somefunc($stuff){
     $output = "my bold text &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;{$stuff}&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;.";
     return $output;
    }

    $var1 = &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF
    &amp;lt;html lang="en"&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;AAAHHHHH&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;

     &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
      somefunc("is awesome!") 
      somefunc("is actually not so awesome..") 
      because somefunc("won\'t work due to my problem.")
     &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
EOF;
?&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

I think that, if you don't find any plugins/tools that can handle the graphing over time, you should look at the tool that suits you most and offers you all the information you need; even if the given information is only for the current build of your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note, the &lt;em&gt;eclipse metrics plugin&lt;/em&gt; allows you to &lt;a href="http://eclipse-metrics.sourceforge.net/example/index.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;export the data to an external file&lt;/a&gt; (link goes to an example), so if you use a source control tool, and you should!, you can always export the data for the specific build and store the file along with the source code, that way you still have a (basic) way to go back in time and check the differences.&lt;/p&gt;

If you do something like parent.doSomething() it's not possible to use that class in container that doesn't have the doSometing() method. I think it's definitely better to pass in whatever the class may need and then inside the class it doesn't have to do any parent.parent etc anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this if you in the future want to change the structure, it's very easy to just pass in a new reference; the implementation of the child class doesn't have to change at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third alternative you have here is also very different, it's accessing a class level static method (you don't have to type the whole class path when accessing that method), not an instance method as in the first two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple: use them all the time, unless you have a very good reason not to (for instance, don't use atomic transactions for "long running activities" between businesses). The default should always be yes. You are in doubt? - use transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are transactions beneficial? They help you deal with crashes, failures, data consistency, error handling, they help you write simpler code etc. And the list of benefits will continue to grow with time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see that, for example, when you implement a checkout process you only want to finalize it once you gathered all data, etc.. Think about a payment f'up, you can rollback - that's an example when you need a transaction. Or maybe when it's wise to use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you need a transaction when you create a new user account? Maybe, if it's across 10 tables (for whatever reason), if it's just a single table then probably not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also depends on what you sold your client on and who they are, and if they requested it, etc.. But if making a decision is up to you, then I'd say, choose wisely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My bottom line is, avoid premature optimization. Build your application, keep in mind that you may want to go back and refactor/optimize later when you need it. Look at a couple opensource projects and see how they implemented different parts of their app, learn from that. You'll see that most of them don't use transactions at all, yet there are huge online stores that use them.&lt;/p&gt;

OpenID is incredibly insecure and stealing the person's ID as they log in is trivially easy. [ taken from David Arno's &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/60436/what-is-the-benefit-of-using-only-openid-authentication-on-a-site#173467"&gt;Answer&lt;/a&gt; below ]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all of the downside, the one upside is to allow users to have fewer logins on the Internet.  If a site has opt-in for OpenID then users who want that feature can use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I would like to understand is:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What benefit does a site get for making OpenID &lt;b&gt;mandatory&lt;/b&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That critical point of failure could be the confirmation email you send out, but the user's mailbox is a) unavailable due to a typo, b) full or c) provider is 'down'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takes a user to another sites content and every time they logon to your site&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see that, but IMHO - this is not so bad. I mean, Y! seems to be one of the most cluttered logins and it also never works for me. ;) Aside, most OpenID providers don't look so bad (yet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, keep your audience in mind. If mom and pop are your users, OpenID is probably confusing as hell. But so is probably a lot on the Internet. In SO's case, the people are somewhat savvy users and know what they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adds a non-trial amount of time to the signup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a non-issue. Look at the list of providers:
&lt;a href="http://openid.net/get/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://openid.net/get/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many people have at least a Yahoo! account, so if it actually worked. It wouldn't be so bad. I agree though that if a user doesn't have OpenID, and doesn't know what it's for. It's not so easy to educate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And think about the implication - "to register for site A, you need to register at site B". And we all know that registering per se is a pain in the ass. But in the long run, this is also exactly what OpenID tries to address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mainstream, I currently see no value for making OpenID mandatory. I like it as an add-on though. Just how people provide links to "login with your Facebook", etc.. Then people who don't get it (or don't care) don't need to bother. But others can still use it.&lt;/p&gt;

Both would protect you from SQL injection. The parameterized query is considered the better practice, but escaping characters in your variable will require fewer changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll do the simpler string escaping one first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;//Connect

$unsafe_variable = $_POST["user-input"];
$safe_variable = mysql_real_escape_string($unsafe_variable);

mysql_query("INSERT INTO table (column) VALUES ('" . $safe_variable . "')");

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of PHP 5.5.0 &lt;code&gt;mysql_real_escape_string&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;mysql&lt;/code&gt; extension are &lt;em&gt;deprecated&lt;/em&gt;.
Please use &lt;code&gt;mysqli&lt;/code&gt; extension and &lt;code&gt;mysqli::escape_string&lt;/code&gt; function instead&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use the parameterized query, you need to use &lt;a href="http://php.net/mysqli"&gt;MySQLi&lt;/a&gt; rather than the &lt;a href="http://php.net/mysql"&gt;MySQL&lt;/a&gt; functions. To rewrite your example, we would need something like the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?php
    $mysqli = new mysqli("server", "username", "password", "database_name");

    // TODO - Check that connection was successful.

    $unsafe_variable = $_POST["user-input"];

    $stmt = $mysqli-&amp;gt;prepare("INSERT INTO table (column) VALUES (?)");

    // TODO check that $stmt creation succeeded

    // "s" means the database expects a string
    $stmt-&amp;gt;bind_param("s", $unsafe_variable);

    $stmt-&amp;gt;execute();

    $stmt-&amp;gt;close();

    $mysqli-&amp;gt;close();
?&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key function you'll want to read up on there would be &lt;a href="http://php.net/mysqli.prepare"&gt;&lt;code&gt;mysqli::prepare&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, as others have suggested, you may find it useful/easier to step up a layer of abstraction with something like &lt;a href="http://php.net/pdo"&gt;PDO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that the case you asked about is a fairly simple one, and that more complex cases may require more complex approaches. In particular:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to alter the structure of the SQL based on user input, parameterised queries are not going to help, and the escaping required is not covered by &lt;code&gt;mysql_real_escape_string&lt;/code&gt;. In this kind of case you would be better off passing the user's input through a whitelist to ensure only 'safe' values are allowed through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you use integers from user input in a condition and take the &lt;code&gt;mysql_real_escape_string&lt;/code&gt; approach, you will suffer from the problem described by &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/978756/polynomial"&gt;Polynomial&lt;/a&gt; in the comments below. This case is trickier because integers would not be surrounded by quotes, so you could deal with by validating that the user input contains only digits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are likely other cases I'm not aware of. You might find &lt;a href="http://webappsec.org/projects/articles/091007.txt"&gt;http://webappsec.org/projects/articles/091007.txt&lt;/a&gt; a useful resource on some of the more subtle problems you can encounter.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It depends upon the work that the particular stored procedure performs and, perhaps, not so much the "read/write ratio" that you suggest.  In general, you should consider enclosing a unit of work within a transaction if it is query that could be impacted by some other, simultaneously running query.  If this sounds nondeterministic, it is.  It is often difficult to predict under what circumstances a particular unit of work qualifies as a candidate for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good place to start is to review the precise &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete" rel="nofollow"&gt;CRUD&lt;/a&gt; being performed within the unit of work, in this case within your stored procedure, and decide if it a) could be affected by some other, simultaneous operation and b) if that other work matters to the end result of this work being performed (or, even, vice versa).  If the answer is "Yes" to both of these then consider wrapping the unit of work within a transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this is suggesting is that you can't always simply decide to either &lt;em&gt;use or not use transaction&lt;/em&gt;s, rather you should apply them when it makes sense.  Use the properties defined by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID" rel="nofollow"&gt;ACID&lt;/a&gt; (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) to help decide when this might be the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other thing to consider is that in some circumstances, particularly if the system must perform many operations in quick succession, e.g., a high-volume transaction processing application, you might need to weigh the relative performance cost of the transaction.  Depending upon the size of the unit of work, a commit (or rollback) of a transaction can be resource expensive, perhaps negatively impacting the performance of your system unnecessarily or, at least, with limited benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this is not an easy question to precisely answer: "It depends."&lt;/p&gt;

The Basic Premise is to have a system that has 100% uptime but can become more efficient dynamically.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is the scenario:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   * So we hash out a system quickly to a
  specified set of interfaces, it has
  zero optimizations, yet we are
  confident that it is 100% stable
  though &lt;em&gt;(dubious, but for the sake of
  this scenario please play
  along)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   * We then profile
  the original classes, and start to
  program replacements for the
  bottlenecks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  * The original and the replacement are initiated simultaneously and
  synchronized.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  * An original is allowed to run to completion: if a replacement hasnt
  completed it is vetoed by the system
  as a replacement for the
  original.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  * A replacement must always return the same value as the original, for a
  specified number of times, and for a
  specific range of values, before it is
  adopted as a replacement for the
  original.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  * If exception occurs after a replacement is adopted, the system
  automatically tries the same operation
  with a class which was superseded by
  it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Have you seen a similar concept in practise?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Critique Please ...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Below are comments written after the initial question in regards to
  posts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  * The system demonstrates a Darwinian approach to system evolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  * The original and replacement would run in parallel not in series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  * Race-conditions are an inherent issue to multi-threaded apps and I
  acknowledge them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you start Emacs using an MS Windows shortcut, the &lt;code&gt;default-directory&lt;/code&gt; is initially the folder (directory) specified in the "Start In" field of the shortcut properties.

&lt;p&gt;If you're using Emacs from the command line, &lt;code&gt;default-directory&lt;/code&gt; starts as the directory where you started Emacs (the cwd).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out the data set [i.e. specify the data model].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Split the data set into resources. For each kind of resource:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name the resources with URIs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expose a subset of the uniform interface [i.e. specify which HTTP methods are used and what they do].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design the representations(s) accepted from the client [e.g. the XML format you can PUT or POST].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design the representations(s) served to the client [e.g. the XML you get back].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate this resource into existing resources, using hypermedia links and forms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the typical course of events: what's supposed to happen? [This is like a use case main success scenario.]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider error conditions. [This is like use case exception scenarios.]&lt;/li&gt;

Compared to WCF (which added REST support later), ADO.Net Data Services was built primarily for REST.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The uniform interface constraints describe how a service built for the Web can be a good participant in the Web architecture. These constraints are described briefly as follows :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Identification of resources: A resource is any information item that can be named and represented (e.g. a document, a stock price at a given point in time, the current weather in Las Vegas, etc). Resources in your service should be identified using URIs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Manipulation of resources via representations: A representation is the physical representation of a resource and should correspond to a valid media type. Using standard media types as the data formats behind your service increases the reach of your service by making it accessible to a wide range of potential clients. Interaction with the resource should be based on retrieval and manipulation of the representation of the resource identified by its URI. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3)Self-descriptive messages: Following the principles of statelessness in your service's interactions, using standard media types and correctly indicating the cacheability of messages via HTTP method usage and control headers ensures that messages are self descriptive. Self descriptive messages make it possible for messages to be processed by intermediaries between the client and server without impacting either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4)Hypermedia as the engine of application state: Application state should be expressed using URIs and hyperlinks to transition between states. This is probably the most controversial and least understood of the architectural constraints set forth in &lt;a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm"&gt;Roy Fielding's dissertation&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, Fielding's dissertation contains an explicit arguments against using HTTP cookies for representing application state to hammer this point home yet it is often ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

This way it is impossible for an attacker to inject malicious SQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You basically have two options to achieve this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php"&gt;PDO&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-php prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$stmt = $pdo-&amp;gt;prepare('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = :name');

$stmt-&amp;gt;execute(array('name' =&amp;gt; $name));

foreach ($stmt as $row) {
    // do something with $row
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.mysqli.php"&gt;MySQLi&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-php prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$stmt = $dbConnection-&amp;gt;prepare('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = ?');
$stmt-&amp;gt;bind_param('s', $name);

$stmt-&amp;gt;execute();

$result = $stmt-&amp;gt;get_result();
while ($row = $result-&amp;gt;fetch_assoc()) {
    // do something with $row
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Correctly setting up the connection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that when using &lt;code&gt;PDO&lt;/code&gt; to access a MySQL database &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; prepared statements are &lt;strong&gt;not used by default&lt;/strong&gt;. To fix this you have to disable the emulation of prepared statements. An example of creating a connection using PDO is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-php prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$dbConnection = new PDO('mysql:dbname=dbtest;host=127.0.0.1;charset=utf8', 'user', 'pass');

$dbConnection-&amp;gt;setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES, false);
$dbConnection-&amp;gt;setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above example the error mode isn't strictly necessary, &lt;strong&gt;but it is advised to add it&lt;/strong&gt;. This way the script will not stop with a &lt;code&gt;Fatal Error&lt;/code&gt; when something goes wrong. And it gives the developer the chance to &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; any error(s) which are &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt;n as &lt;code&gt;PDOException&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is &lt;strong&gt;mandatory&lt;/strong&gt; however is the first &lt;code&gt;setAttribute()&lt;/code&gt; line, which tells PDO to disable emulated prepared statements and use &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; prepared statements. This makes sure the statement and the values aren't parsed by PHP before sending it to the MySQL server (giving a possible attacker no chance to inject malicious SQL).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although you can set the &lt;code&gt;charset&lt;/code&gt; in the options of the constructor, it's important to note that 'older' versions of PHP (&amp;lt; 5.3.6) &lt;a href="http://php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-mysql.connection.php"&gt;silently ignored the charset parameter&lt;/a&gt; in the DSN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Explanation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens is that the SQL statement you pass to &lt;code&gt;prepare&lt;/code&gt; is parsed and compiled by the database server. By specifying parameters (either a &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; or a named parameter like &lt;code&gt;:name&lt;/code&gt; in the example above) you tell the database engine where you want to filter on. Then when you call &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt;, the prepared statement is combined with the parameter values you specify. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important thing here is that the parameter values are combined with the compiled statement, not an SQL string. SQL injection works by tricking the script into including malicious strings when it creates SQL to send to the database. So by sending the actual SQL separately from the parameters, you limit the risk of ending up with something you didn't intend. Any parameters you send when using a prepared statement will just be treated as strings (although the database engine may do some optimization so parameters may end up as numbers too, of course). In the example above, if the &lt;code&gt;$name&lt;/code&gt; variable contains &lt;code&gt;'Sarah'; DELETE FROM employees&lt;/code&gt; the result would simply be a search for the string &lt;code&gt;"'Sarah'; DELETE FROM employees"&lt;/code&gt;, and you will not end up with &lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/327/"&gt;an empty table&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another benefit with using prepared statements is that if you execute the same statement many times in the same session it will only be parsed and compiled once, giving you some speed gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and since you asked about how to do it for an insert, here's an example (using PDO):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-php prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$preparedStatement = $db-&amp;gt;prepare('INSERT INTO table (column) VALUES (:column)');

$preparedStatement-&amp;gt;execute(array('column' =&amp;gt; $unsafeValue));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like most of your objectives would be meet by some sort of super source control system, which could be implemented with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CruiseControl" rel="nofollow"&gt;CruiseControl&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CruiseControl can run unit tests to ensure correctness of the new version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'd have to write a CruiseControl builder &lt;a href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/main/plugins.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;pluggin&lt;/a&gt; that would execute the new version of your system against a series of existing benchmarks to ensure that the new version is an improvement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the CruiseControl build loop passes, then the new version would be accepted. Such a process would take considerable effort to implement, but I think it feasible. The unit tests and benchmark builder would have to be pretty slick. &lt;/p&gt;

So you won't be able to acheive this without changing the signature of your render method.  &lt;a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/pointers-to-members.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; article explains why this is generally a bad idea.

A better way might be to define a "Renderer" interface which your classes that have render methods can implement and have that be the parameter type of your main Render method.  You could then write a "StaticCaller" implementation to support the calling of your static methods by reference.

eg (My C++ is really rusty, I haven't compiled this either).

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;

void Render(IRenderer *Renderer)
{
    D3dDevice-&gt;BeginScene();
    Renderer-&gt;Render();
    D3dDevice-&gt;EndScene();
    D3dDevice-&gt;Present(0,0,0,0);
}

// The "interface"
public class IRenderer 
{
public:
    virtual void Render();
};

public class StaticCaller: public IRenderer
{
    void (*Call)();
public:

    StaticCaller((*Call)())
    {
        this-&gt;Call = Call;
    }

    void Render()
    {
        Call();
    }
};

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this is pretty boilerplate but it should make for more readability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third highest &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.uservoice.com/pages/general/suggestions/16685"&gt;idea on uservoice for Stackoverflow&lt;/a&gt; is to allow changing the OpenID provider. And in the comments there is the suggestion to allow associating more than on OpenID. On sites where multiple OpenIDs can be associated with an account if your usual OpenID provider is down you can still log in with another provider (assuming you've already associated it with the site). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it's only a critical point of failure for users of the OpenID provider that isn't working. All the other users on other OpenID providers can continue to log it. Over time you'd expect that users would migrate to the most reliable providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takes a user to another sites content and every time they logon to your site&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've set up your OpenID provider to always trust a site (or OpenID consumer in the nomenclature) and you are already logged into your OpenID provider then they will redirect you straight back to the site without you even seeing your OpenID providers site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adds a non-trial amount of time to the signup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently that may be true, but as andyuk said, "This becomes less of an issue the more sites that support OpenID". I'd expect that in a few years time most users will already have an OpenID and know what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opaque_pointer" rel="nofollow"&gt;PIMPL Idiom&lt;/a&gt; (Pointer to IMPLementation) is a technique for implementation hiding in which a public class wraps a structure or class that cannot be seen outside the library the public class is part of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This hides internal implementation details and data from the user of the library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When implementing the this idiom why would you place the public methods on the pimpl class and not the public class since the public classes method implementaions would be compiled into the library and the user only has the header file?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate, this code puts the Purr() implementation on the impl class and wraps it as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why not implement Purr directly on the public class?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;//header file:
class Cat {
    private:
        class CatImpl;  // Not defined here
        CatImpl *cat_;  // Handle

    public:
        Cat();            // Constructor
        ~Cat();           // Destructor
        // Other operations...
        Purr();
};


//CPP file:
#include "cat.h"

class Cat::CatImpl {
    Purr();
...     // The actual implementation can be anything
};

Cat::Cat() {
    cat_ = new CatImpl;
}

Cat::~Cat() {
    delete cat_;
}

Cat::Purr(){ cat_-&amp;gt;Purr(); }
CatImpl::Purr(){
   printf("purrrrrr");
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think, outside of a few exceptions - like a community for developers - at this time, you can't force OpenID only.  The "average" web user (whatever that means) doesn't get it.  However, promoting it in a site like this raises awareness among developers, and the idea will eventually trickle down.  As OpenID appears on more and more sites, people will look in to it, realize they have one, and then start using it.  In order for OpenID - which is a great idea - to catch on, there needs to be a critical mass of users and sites supporting it.  &lt;/p&gt;

It's also known as the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire_Cat"&gt;Cheshire Cat&lt;/a&gt; because of Lewis Caroll's character that fades away until only the grin remains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example code should be distributed across two sets of source files. Then only Cat.h is the file that is shipped with the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CatImpl.h is included by Cat.cpp and CatImpl.cpp contains the implementation for CatImpl::Purr(). This won't be visible to the public using your product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically the idea is to hide as much as possible of the implementation fom prying eyes.
This is most useful where you have a commercial product that is shipped as a series of libraries that are accessed via an API that the customer's code is compiled against and linked to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did this with the rewrite of IONAs Orbix 3.3 product in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned by others, using his technique completely decouples the implementation from the interface of the object. Then you won't have to recompile everything that uses Cat if you just want to change the implementation of Purr().&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technique is used in a methodology called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract"&gt;design by contract&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if your Pimpl class has ComplicatedClass as a member (and not just a pointer or reference to it) then you would need to have ComplicatedClass fully defined before it's use. In practice, this means including "ComplicatedClass.h" (which will also indirectly include anything ComplicatedClass depends on). This can lead to a single header fill pulling in lots and lots of stuff, which is bad for managing your dependencies (and your compile times).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you use the pimpl idion, you only need to #include the stuff used in the public interface of your Owner type (which would be Cat here). Which makes things better for people using your library, and means you don't need to worry about people depending on some internal part of your library - either by mistake, or because they want to do something you don't allow so they #define private public before including your files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious problem is that if you use some kind of program to analyze the compiler and its determinism, how do you know that &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; program gets compiled correctly, and produces the correct result?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're using another, "safe" compiler though, I'm not sure. What I'm sure is writing a compiler from scratch would probably be an easier job.&lt;/p&gt;

From these rectangles you can construct a rectangle that spans the whole area. Use this to draw the background in a &lt;code&gt;Shape&lt;/code&gt; placed behind the text field, or in the parent of the text field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt; you asked for an example, here is how to get a rectangle from a range of characters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var firstCharBounds : Rectangle = textField.getCharBoundaries(firstCharIndex);
var lastCharBounds  : Rectangle = textField.getCharBoundaries(lastCharIndex);

var rangeBounds : Rectangle = new Rectangle();

rangeBounds.topLeft = firstCharBounds.topLeft;
rangeBounds.bottomRight = lastCharBounds.bottomRight;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to find a rectangle for a whole line you can do this instead:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var charBounds : Rectangle = textField.getCharBoundaries(textField.getLineOffset(lineNumber));

var lineBounds : Rectangle = new Rectangle(0, charBounds.y, textField.width, firstCharBounds.height);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have the bounds of the text range you want to paint a background for, you can do this in the &lt;code&gt;updateDisplayList&lt;/code&gt; method of the parent of the text field (assuming the text field is positioned at [0, 0] and has white text, and that &lt;code&gt;textRangesWithYellowBackground&lt;/code&gt; is an array of rectangles that represent the text ranges that should have yellow backgrounds):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;graphics.clear();

// this draws the black background
graphics.beginFill(0x000000);
graphics.drawRect(0, 0, textField.width, textField.height);
graphics.endFill();

// this draws yellow text backgrounds
for each ( var r : Rectangle in textRangesWithYellowBackground )
    graphics.beginFill(0xFFFF00);
    graphics.drawRect(r.x, r.y, r.width, r.height);
    graphics.endFill();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally I would like to automate Safari in a similar way to using &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa741317.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;mshtml&lt;/a&gt; for Internet Explorer. Failing that a way to inject JavaScript into the running process would also be fine. I've used the JavaScript injection method to automate Firefox via the &lt;a href="http://www.croczilla.com/jssh" rel="nofollow"&gt;jssh&lt;/a&gt; plug-in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm looking to automate the browser using .Net to enhance an existing automation framework &lt;a href="http://watin.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow"&gt;WatiN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;: Whilst I think selenium might be a great choice for automating Safari in certain scenarios, I would like to use a solution that does not require installing software on the server i.e. Selenium Core or an intermediate proxy server in the case of Selenium Remote Control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: 23-03-2009&lt;/strong&gt;:
Whilst I've not yet found a way to automate Safari, I have found a way to automate Webkit inside of Chrome. If you run Chrome using the --remote-shell-port=9999 command line switches (ref: &lt;a href="http://www.ericdlarson.com/misc/chrome_command_line_flags.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.ericdlarson.com/misc/chrome_command_line_flags.html&lt;/a&gt;) you can send javascript to the browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once connected to the remote debug seesion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send &lt;strong&gt;debug()&lt;/strong&gt; to attach to the current tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send any javascript command using &lt;strong&gt;print&lt;/strong&gt;, i.e. print document.window.location.href&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've used this method to add &lt;a href="http://watin.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/watin/trunk/src/Core/Native/Chrome/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Chrome support to WatiN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The reason is, of course, that &lt;strong&gt;a compiler is a peice of software&lt;/strong&gt;, and is therefore susceptible to bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compiler writers have the advantage of working from a high quality spec, while the rest of us have to figure out what we're making as we go along.  However, compiler specs &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; have bugs, and complex parts with subtle interactions.  So, it's not exactly trivial to figure out what the compiler should be doing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, once you decide what you think the language spec means, you can write a good, fast, automated test for every nuance.  This is where compiler writing has a huge advantage over writing other kinds of software: in testing.  Every bug becomes an automated test case, and the test suite can very thorough.  Compiler vendors have a lot more budget to invest in verifying the correctness of the compiler than you do (you already have a day job, right?).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for you?  It means that you need to be open to the possibilities of bugs in your compiler, but chances are you won't find any yourself.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would pick a compiler vendor that is not likely to go out of business any time soon, that has a history of high quality in their compilers, and that has demonstrated their ability to service (patch) their products.  Compilers seem to get more correct over time, so I'd choose one that's been around a decade or two.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus your attention on getting your code right.&lt;/strong&gt;  If it's &lt;strong&gt;clear and simple&lt;/strong&gt;, then when you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; hit a compiler bug, you won't have to think really hard to decide where the problem lies.  &lt;strong&gt;Write good unit tests&lt;/strong&gt;, which will ensure that your code does what you expect it to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Install Visual Studio 2008 then Install Silverlight Tools Beta 2 for Visual Studio 2008
This add-on to Visual Studio 2008 allows you to use .NET to create Silverlight 2 Beta 2 Web sites. The Silverlight 2 Beta 2 Runtime and the Silverlight 2 Beta 2 SDK are installed as part of this install. For additional information read the overview and the Silverlight 2 Beta 2 Readme Notes. Note if you have Visual Studio 2008 Service Pack 1 Beta installed, please see this information for details on installing correctly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Install Expression Blend 2.5 June 2008 Preview
This is a preview version of Expression Blend for designing Silverlight 2 experiences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Install Deep Zoom Composer
This tool allows you to prepare your images for use with the Deep Zoom feature in Silverlight 2. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to watch out for is that Silverlight does not support Synchronous calls to the server. All calls are &lt;a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/pages/silverlight-tutorial-part-3-using-networking-to-retrieve-data-and-populate-a-datagrid.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;Asynchronous&lt;/a&gt; as of &lt;a href="http://petesbloggerama.blogspot.com/2008/07/omg-silverlight-asynchronous-is-evil.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;this Beta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Depending on your needs, there many be no reason to actually use the XML part of AJAX.  Just run a simple Asynchronous request, possibly with a few querystring variables, and get back a simple one word, or even a number as a response.

You can probably create or find some bindings for the scripting languages as well.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise if it's really important to be able to interface with scripting languages your best bet is simply to use files, pipes or sockets or even a higher level abstraction like HTTP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your code gets compiled into three types of memory:&lt;br /&gt;
   1. .data: initialized memory&lt;br /&gt;
   2. .text: constants and code&lt;br /&gt;
   3. .bss: uninitialized memory  (initialized to 0 in C++ if not explicitly initialized)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globals go in .data if initialized. If not they are placed in .bss and zero'ed in premain code.&lt;/p&gt;

Failing that, use Maximilian's technique, but be warned that it is a maintenance horror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you cannot edit the code, you can patch the import tables to redirect calls to your own code. A description of this technique can be found in &lt;a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/system/hooksys.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; - search for the section titled "Spying by altering of the Import Address Table".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is dangerous, but if you're careful you can make it work. Also check out &lt;a href="http://research.microsoft.com/sn/detours/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Microsoft Detours&lt;/a&gt;, which does the same sort of thing but doesn't require you to mess around with the actual patching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal is to look at the incoming request at the Web Server level, and inject some custom HttpHeaders into the request. &lt;code&gt;(for ex: HTTP\_EAUTH\_ID)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And later in the page lifecycle of an ASPX page, i should be able to use that variable as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;string eauthId = Request.ServerVariables["HTTP\_EAUTH\_ID"].ToString();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So implementing this module at the Web Server level, is it possible to alter the ServerVariables collection ?? &lt;/p&gt;
