The Android SDK doesn't provide a direct method to change the indicator of a &lt;code&gt;TabHost&lt;/code&gt; after it's been created.  The &lt;code&gt;TabSpec&lt;/code&gt; is only used to build the tab, so changing the &lt;code&gt;TabSpec&lt;/code&gt; after the fact will have no effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there's a workaround, though.  Call &lt;code&gt;mTabs.getTabWidget()&lt;/code&gt; to get a &lt;code&gt;TabWidget&lt;/code&gt; object.  This is just a subclass of &lt;code&gt;ViewGroup&lt;/code&gt;, so you can call &lt;code&gt;getChildCount()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;getChildAt()&lt;/code&gt; to access individual tabs within the &lt;code&gt;TabWidget&lt;/code&gt;.  Each of these tabs is also a View, and in the case of a tab with a graphical indicator and a text label, it's almost certainly some other &lt;code&gt;ViewGroup&lt;/code&gt; (maybe a &lt;code&gt;LinearLayout&lt;/code&gt;, but it doesn't matter) that contains an &lt;code&gt;ImageView&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;TextView&lt;/code&gt;.  So with a little fiddling with the debugger or &lt;code&gt;Log.i&lt;/code&gt;, you should be able to figure out a recipe to get the &lt;code&gt;ImageView&lt;/code&gt; and change it directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside is that if you're not careful, the exact layout of the controls within a tab could change and your app could break.  Your initial solution is perhaps more robust, but then again it might lead to other unwanted side effects like flicker or focus problems.&lt;/p&gt;

This is useful because the back button will take the user back to scroll position they were at previously, leaving the reader to find their place in the text. Clicking on a link back to where the footnote was referenced in the text puts that text at the top of the window, making it very easy for the reader to pick up where they left off . &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quirksmode has a page on &lt;a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2005/07/footnotes_on_th.html"&gt;footnotes on the web&lt;/a&gt; (although it suggests you use &lt;a href="http://andreas.web-graphics.com/footnotes/"&gt;sidenotes&lt;/a&gt; instead of footnotes I think that footnotes are more &lt;strong&gt;accessible&lt;/strong&gt;, with a link to the footnote and the footnote followed by a link back to the text I suspect they would be easier to follow with a &lt;strong&gt;screen reader&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the links from the quirksmode page suggests having an arrow, &amp;#8617;, after the text of the footnote linking back, and to use entity &amp;amp;#8617; for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;This is main body of my content.
I have a footnote link for this line
&amp;lt;a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1"&amp;gt;[1]&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.
Then, I have some more content.
Some of it is interesting and it has some footnotes as well
&amp;lt;a id="footnote-2-ref" href="#footnote-2"&amp;gt;[2]&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.

&amp;lt;p id="footnote-1"&amp;gt;
   1. Here is my first footnote. &amp;lt;a href="#footnote-1-ref"&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#8617&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; 
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p id="footnote-2"&amp;gt;
   2. Another footnote. &amp;lt;a href="#footnote-2-ref"&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#8617&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure how screen readers would handle the entity though. Linked to from the comments of Grubber's post is &lt;a href="http://www.clagnut.com/blog/1528/"&gt;Bob Eastern's post on the accessibility of footnotes&lt;/a&gt; which suggests it isn't read, although that was a number of years ago and I'd hope screen readers would have improved by now. For accessibility it might be worth using a text anchor such as "return to text" or perhaps putting it in the title attribute of the link. It may also be worth putting one on the original footnote although I don't know how screen readers would handle that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;This is main body of my content.
I have a footnote link for this line
&amp;lt;a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1" title="link to footnote"&amp;gt;[1]&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.

   1. Here is my first footnote.

&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

I use MooTools, but there are many others that are very solid (Prototype, YUI, jQuery, etc). These include methods for attaching functionality to the DomReady event. The problem with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;window.onload = function(){...};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is that you can only ever have one function attached to that event (subsequent assignments will overwrite this one).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frameworks provide more appropriate methods for doing this. For example, in MooTools:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;window.addEvent('domready', function(){...});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are other ways to avoid polluting the global namespace. Just namespacing your own code (mySite.foo = function...) will help you avoid any potential conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more thing. I'm not 100% sure from your comment that the problem you have is specific to the page load event. Are you saying that the code needs to be executed when the ajax returns as well? Please edit your question if this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you're essentially looking for is taking settings for a particular computer and cloning them to different hardware.  nLite and unattended installs are great and fantastic for getting the OS up and running, but they suck when it comes to getting individual applications to very specific settings.  Sysprep &amp;amp; Ghost clone the entire setup, which saves mucho time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process is fairly straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build one computer, ground up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a single user on the computer, named 'user' or something similar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log into user and do all your application installs, customizations, and updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add drivers for all of your additional machines into the windows drivers folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run sysprep.exe, select the use minisetup option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sysprep shuts down the machine, then use ghost to make a hard disk image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clone the disk image to the other machines using the ghost network copy or serial cables if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On boot, the machines will prompt you for a new network name.  (Essential for lab environments.  Can't have 40 computers all named LABMACHINE-1.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of minor steps along the way, but this is the way to go.  I will also say that this is more IT then programming, but &amp;lt;3 IT.&lt;/p&gt;

GSM-338 contains a subset of the Unicode characters, so what you're doing is extracting a set of codepoints from your string, and checking to see if that set is contained in GSM-338.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// second column of http://unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/ETSI/GSM0338.TXT
$gsm338_codepoints = array(0x0040, 0x0000, ..., 0x00fc, 0x00e0)
$can_use_gsm338 = true;
foreach(codepoints($mystring) as $codepoint){
    if(!in_array($codepoint, $gsm338_codepoints)){
      $can_use_gsm338 = false;
      break;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That leaves the definition of the function codepoints($string), which isn't built in to PHP. PHP understands a string to be a sequence of bytes rather than a sequence of Unicode characters. The best way of bridging the gap is to get your strings into UTF8 as quickly as you can and keep them in UTF8 as long as you can - you'll have to use other encodings when dealing with external systems, but isolate the conversion to the interface to that system and deal only with utf8 internally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The functions you need to convert between php strings in utf8 and sequences of codepoints can be found at &lt;a href="http://hsivonen.iki.fi/php-utf8/"&gt;http://hsivonen.iki.fi/php-utf8/&lt;/a&gt; , so that's your codepoints() function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're taking data from an external source that gives you Unicode slash-escaped characters ("Let's test \u00f6\u00e4\u00fc..."), that string escape format should be converted to utf8. I don't know offhand of a function to do this, if one can't be found, it's a matter of string/regex processing + the use of the hsivonen.iki.fi functions, for example when you hit \u00f6, replace it with the utf8 representation of the codepoint 0xf6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone will probably suggest SourceSafe. Avoid it like the plague. SourceSafe silently destroys history and causes no end of grief. A little googling will tell you more about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subversion is mature and has a lot of good tools and IDE integration. It works well on most networks since it uses HTTP to access the repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked on a SCM conversion a couple of years ago and the best thing you can do is try them out. SCM vendors will give you demos and tech support for your evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing a SCM is not an easy thing to do. It really depends on your codebase and workflow. Some systems handle huge codebases better then others. Some handle lot's of branches and merges better then others. Some are better for remote access then others. Some have more fine grained security models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get everybody who will interact with the system together and make a list of what you need/want. Get the demos and import your code into it and try it out. Choosing a SCM for a group that large is a major project and should be treated as such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it's high, I would probably start with Ogre (the best strictly rendering open source engine, IMHO) or another open source game engine, such as Delta3D, if you want additional features (sound, physics, etc.) that a game engine brings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't want to go with an engine, I would go with Direct3D, because it's being updated much quicker than OpenGL.  I don't want to get into all the issues, but version 3.0 of OpenGL was announced during SIGGRAPH and most in the community were very disappointed with it.  Direct3D puts you in a much better position to take advantage of shaders and other uses of the programmable pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your programming ability is not too high, and you are doing this to learn programming, I would start with OpenGL, because it is easier to learn and there are more resources on the web (see &lt;a href="http://nehe.gamedev.net" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://nehe.gamedev.net&lt;/a&gt; for example).&lt;/p&gt;

What I can't figure out is how to get data from a data URL into the clipboard so that it can be pasted into other applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the code I use to copy text (well, XUL):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var transferObject=Components.classes["@mozilla.org/widget/transferable;1"].

var objToSerialize=aDOMNode;

transferObject.addDataFlavor("text/xul");

var xmls=new XMLSerializer();
var serializedObj=xmls.serializeToString(objToSerialize);

stringWrapper.data=serializedObj;

transferObject.setTransferData("text/xul",stringWrapper,serializedObj.length*2);

&lt;p&gt;The bookmarklet itself reads as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;javascript:void((function(){var%20e=document.createElement('script');e.setAttribute('type','text/javascript');e.setAttribute('src','http://www.iminta.com/javascripts/new_bookmarklet.js?noCache='+new%20Date().getTime());document.body.appendChild(e)})())

&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that the bookmarklet creates an iframe, positions it, and adds events to the document to allow the user to do things like hit escape (to close the window) or to scroll (so it stays visible). It also hides elements that don't play well with z-positioning (flash, for example). Finally, it facilitates communicating across to the javascript that is running within the iframe. In this way, you can have a close button in the iframe that tells the parent document to remove the iframe. This kind of cross-domain stuff is a bit hacky, but it's the only way (I've seen) to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not for the feint of heart; if you're not good at JavaScript, prepare to struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

Custom configuration management software is used to write out the server.xml, and various resources (connection pools, beans, server variables, etc) written into server.xml configure the servlet. This is all well and good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the names of some of the resources aren't known in advance. For example, the Servlet may need access to any number of "Anonymizers" as configured by the operator. Each anonymizer has a unique name associated with it. We create and configure each anonymizer using java beans similar to the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Resource
  name="bean/Anonymizer_toon"
  type="com.company.tomcatutil.AnonymizerBean"
  factory="org.apache.naming.factory.BeanFactory"
  className="teAnonymizer"
  databaseId="50"
/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;Resource
  name="bean/Anonymizer_default"
  type="com.company.tomcatutil.AnonymizerBean"
  factory="org.apache.naming.factory.BeanFactory"
  className="teAnonymizer"
  databaseId="54"
/&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this appears to require us to have explicit entries in the Servlet's context.xml file for each an every possible resource name in advance. I'd like to replace the explicit context.xml entries with wildcards, or know if there is a better solution to this type of problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &amp;lt;ResourceLink name="bean/Anonymizer_default"
                global="bean/Anonymizer_default"
                type="com.company.tomcatutil.AnonymizerBean"/&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;ResourceLink name="bean/Anonymizer_toon"
                global="bean/Anonymizer_toon"
                type="com.company.tomcatutil.AnonymizerBean"/&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replaced with something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &amp;lt;ResourceLink name="bean/Anonymizer_*"
                global="bean/Anonymizer_*"
                type="com.company.tomcatutil.AnonymizerBean"/&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I haven't been able to figure out if this is possible or what the correct syntax might be. Can anyone make any suggestions about better ways to handle this?&lt;/p&gt;

Plenty of people have tried it... most have found that they chase "infinite" flexibility and instead end up with much, much less than that. It's the "roach motel" of database designs -- data goes in, but it's almost impossible to get it out. Try and conceptualize writing the code for ANY sort of constraint and you'll see what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end result typically is a system that is MUCH more difficult to debug, maintain, and full of data consistency problems. This is not &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; the case, but more often than not, that is how it ends up. Mostly because the programmer(s) don't see this train wreck coming and fail to defensively code against it. Also, often ends up the case that the "infinite" flexibility really isn't that necessary; it's a very bad "smell" when the dev team gets a spec that says "Gosh I have no clue what sort of data they are going to put here, so let 'em put WHATEVER"... and the end users are just fine having pre-defined attribute types that they can use (code up a generic phone #, and let them create any # of them -- this is trivial in a nicely normalized system and maintains flexibility and integrity!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a very good development team and are &lt;strong&gt;intimately aware&lt;/strong&gt; of the problems you'll have to overcome with this design, you can successfully code up a well designed, not terribly buggy system. Most of the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why start out with the odds stacked so much against you, though?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a &lt;code&gt;TDescendant.MyMethod&lt;/code&gt; would create a potential confusion for the TDescendants in adding another method with the same name, which the compiler warns you about.&lt;br /&gt;
Reintroduce disambiguates that and tells the compiler you know which one to use.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;ADescendant.MyMethod&lt;/code&gt; calls the TDescendant one, &lt;code&gt;(ADescendant as TAncestor).MyMethod&lt;/code&gt; calls the TAncestor one. Always! No confusion. Compiler happy!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is true whether you want the descendant method to be virtual or not: in both cases you want to break the natural linkage of the virtual chain.
And it does not prevent you from calling the inherited code from within the new method.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TDescendant.MyMethod is virtual: ...but you cannot or dont want to use the linkage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You cannot because the method signature is different. You have no other choice as overriding is impossible in this case with return type or parameters not exactly the same.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to restart an inheritance tree from this class.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TDescendant.MyMethod is not virtual: You turn MyMethod into a static one at the TDescendant level and prevent further overriding. All classes inheriting from TDescendant will use the TDescendant implementation.  &lt;/li&gt;

If you know that people will be using your site from mobile devices, it's good to have unobtrusive javascript. However, if you're trying to appeal to a tech-savvy crowd, don't bother with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you're appealing to a crowd that may be using screen readers (blind people), I'd highly suggest using &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAI-ARIA" rel="nofollow"&gt;WAI-ARIA&lt;/a&gt; standards. Dojo's widget system has full support for this, and would be a great and easy way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, In most cases, you don't need unobtrusive javascript. Most people who have javascript disabled are either using a smartphone, using lynx, or have NoScript installed. It's enabled by default in all the major browsers, so you shouldn't have to worry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, it's good to at least have some unobtrusive javascript.  tags are your best friend. For example, one may want to replace a widget that draws rating stars with text. Example using dojo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div dojoType="dojox.Rating" stars="5" value="4"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

Barring massive network congestion or disconnection, it should end up on the other end within a reasonable time.  Is it possible that you have a protocol issue?  For instance, with HTTP the request headers must end with a blank line, and the server will not send any response until one occurs -- does the protocol in use have a similar end-of-message characteristic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's some cleaner code than your original version, removing the delegate, field, and Thread.Sleep.  It preforms the exact same way functionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void SendData(TcpClient tcp, byte[] data) {
    NetworkStream ns = tcp.GetStream();
    // BUG?: should bytWriteBuffer == data?
    IAsyncResult r = ns.BeginWrite(bytWriteBuffer, 0, data.Length, null, null);
    r.AsyncWaitHandle.WaitOne();
    ns.EndWrite(r);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like the question was modified while I wrote the above.  The .WaitOne() may help your timeout issue.  It can be passed a timeout parameter.  This is a lazy wait -- the thread will not be scheduled again until the result is finished, or the timeout expires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You make a trade-off:  code clarity and less future problems for performance.  That's the meaning being 'Don't optimize yet'.  Since you're in the optimize stage, sometimes it's necessary to cut out some readability and good programming practices in favor of performance.  I mean, bitwise hacks aren't readable but they're fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure how many tree objects you have, but i'd personally go with option one.  Unless you're dealing with thousands+ of trees, the pointers really won't amount to much more then a few strings.  If memory really is a super-important issue, try both methods (they seem fairly simple to implement) and run it through a profiler.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The problem with a traditional JIT compilation is that optimizing code takes time. So a JIT compiler can produce decent results but may suffer a significant latency when the application starts up. This is generally not a problem for long-running server-side applications but is a serious problem for client-side software and applications run on smaller devices with limited capabilities. To address this, Sun's compiler technology, called HotSpot, uses a trick called adaptive compilation. If you look at what programs actually spend their time doing, it turns out that they spend almost all their time executing a relatively small part of the code again and again. The chunk of code that is executed repeatedly may be only a small fraction of the total program, but its behavior determines the program's overall performance. Adaptive compilation also allows the Java runtime to take advantage of new kinds of optimizations that simply can't be done in a statically compiled language, hence the claim that Java code can run faster than C/C++ in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;To take advantage of this fact, HotSpot starts out as a normal Java bytecode interpreter, but with a difference: it measures (profiles) the code as it is executing to see what parts are being executed repeatedly. Once it knows which parts of the code are crucial to performance, HotSpot compiles those sections into optimal native machine code. Since it compiles only a small portion of the program into machine code, it can afford to take the time necessary to optimize those portions. The rest of the program may not need to be compiled at all&amp;mdash;just interpreted&amp;mdash;saving memory and time. In fact, Sun's default Java VM can run in one of two modes: client and server, which tell it whether to emphasize quick startup time and memory conservation or flat out performance.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;A natural question to ask at this point is, Why throw away all this good profiling information each time an application shuts down? Well, Sun has partially broached this topic with the release of Java 5.0 through the use of shared, read-only classes that are stored persistently in an optimized form. This significantly reduces both the startup time and overhead of running many Java applications on a given machine. The technology for doing this is complex, but the idea is simple: optimize the parts of the program that need to go fast, and don't worry about the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm kind of wondering how far Sun has gotten with it since Java 5.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;what are the exact options and arguments for each whois server? some offer help, others don't. In general, plain domain names work without any special options.&lt;/li&gt;

Private variables that are exposed as public getter/setter properties, and do get serialized/deserialized as such through those properties.  We did it at my old job al the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to note though is that if you have any logic in those properties, the logic is run, so sometimes, the order of serialization actually matters.  The members are &lt;em&gt;implicitly&lt;/em&gt; ordered by how they are ordered in the code, but there are no guarantees, especially when you are inheriting another object.  Explicitly ordering them is a pain in the rear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;It's also nice to be able to specify a URL to preview your current file that is not necessarily the path of the file itself - so you can edit a class file and preview it using a test harness very easily.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This isn't a great answer, but I would say avoid Zope and especially Plone (which runs on it). Zope has a horrible mixture of data and code in it's database - the ZODB. While the ZODB could be a nice place to persist python objects, it's not good to build your whole site's templates and code in the same URL namespace as user data you are storing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not how people build Plone sites, and hasn't been for a long time (since Plone 2.0, years and years ago). Code lives on the file system, content lives in the database. It's still possible to put code in the database if you absolutely need it, but it is strongly discouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You can move code out of the ZODB and into the filesystem, but it still has to resiide in the URL space of the ZODB - you always need a hook in the ZODB that tells it where your code is, rather than the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, you don't. This is wrong. The "hook" is on the file system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The other problem with Plone is that if you start it out of the box in debug mode, it throws loads of deprecation warnings on itself. This is an indication that the underlying APIs and system were not well designed, and are continuously being overhauled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uh, no. This is an indication that the project is doing &lt;em&gt;responsible evolution&lt;/em&gt; of the code base. All code evolves, and you want to see what methods are no longer the best way to do things. Plone hasn't thrown deprecation warnings about itself since Plone 2.5  and then it was done because it supported two different versions of the underlying Zope architecture (Zope 2.8 and 2.9) at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have spent any time in a serious, stable, software project, you'll know that deprecation is inevitable. Plone handles it in a responsible manner, supporting the old code for two releases (while throwing deprecation warnings), and removes it in the third release. Plone is 8 years old, and constantly evolving to be better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You might find a useful feature, like versions (kind of svn branching inside the ZODB), ZClasses (let you create a class of object in the ZODB without developing an add on product), DTML (a template markup system that makes documents that resemble XML but don't validate) or even the find tab in the main interface, and when you ask on the mailing list about a problem you are having, the response is "That area is deprecated". But it doesn't give big deprecation warnings when you try to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You're confusing concepts here. These things aren't deprecated, they are just not used by Plone. They work fine for Zope, and the only reason why we tell you to not use them is because there are better ways to do all of them. In order: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Versions  Plone has a better versioning system included with Plone 3.0 and later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ZClasses  Archetypes and Dexterity are both better and more powerful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DTML  this isn't deprecated, and we use it for non-XML like data. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find tab  I have no idea why you think this is unsupported / not working. I use it every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, it seems like you used Plone years and years ago, got confused, and gave up. Plone has evolved a lot the past 4 years, and the complaints you post here are simply not true anymore (if they ever were).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that in each action on each request, I have to take this parameter and then retrieve the Helpdesk Department model from the repository based on that key. From that model I can retrieve the list of members, categories etc., which is different for each Helpdesk Department. This obviously violates DRY.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is, how can I create a base controller, which does this for me so that the particular Helpdesk Department specified in the URL is available to all derived controllers, and I can just focus on the actions?&lt;/p&gt;

You cannot simply throw objects created in a context used by the main thread into another thread and expect them to work.  Furthermore, you cannot do your own locking for this; you must at minimum lock the managed object context the objects are in, as appropriate.  But if those objects are bound to by your views a controls, there are no "hooks" that you can add that locking of the context to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's no free lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben Trumbull explains some of the reasons why you need to use a separate context, and why "just reading" isn't as simple or as safe as you might think, in &lt;a href="http://lists.apple.com/archives/webobjects-dev/2004/Dec/msg00255.html" rel="nofollow" title="Re: locking problem"&gt;this great post from late 2004 on the webobjects-dev list&lt;/a&gt;.  (The whole thread is great.)  He's discussing the Enterprise Objects Framework and WebObjects, but his advice is fully applicable to Core Data as well.  Just replace "EC" with "NSManagedObjectContext" and "EOF" with "Core Data" in the meat of his message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution to the problem of sharing data between threads in Core Data, like the Enterprise Objects Framework before it, is "don't."  If you've thought about it further and you really, honestly do have to share data between threads, then the solution is to keep independent object graphs in thread-isolated contexts, and use the information in the save notification from one context to tell the other context what to re-fetch.  &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/CoreDataFramework/Classes/NSManagedObjectContext_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSManagedObjectContext/refreshObject:mergeChanges:" rel="nofollow" title="-[NSManagedObjectContext refreshObject:mergeChanges:]"&gt;&lt;code&gt;-[NSManagedObjectContext refreshObject:mergeChanges:]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is specifically designed to support this use.&lt;/p&gt;

Setting up a repository and using it is actually fairly trivial, even from the command line. Here's how it would go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;if you haven't setup your repo (repository)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure you've got Subversion installed on your server&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ which svn
/usr/bin/svn
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; is a tool that tells you the path to another tool. if it returns nothing that tool is not installed on your system&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1b)&lt;/strong&gt; If not, get it&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ apt-get install subversion
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;apt-get&lt;/em&gt; is a tool that installs other tools onto your system&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that's not the right name for subversion in apt, try this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ apt-cache search subversion
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ apt-cache search svn
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find the right package name and install it using &lt;em&gt;apt-get install packagename&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; Create a new repository on your server&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cd /path/to/directory/of/repositories
$ svnadmin create my_repository
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;svnadmin create reponame&lt;/em&gt; creates a new repository in the present working directory (&lt;em&gt;pwd&lt;/em&gt;) with the name &lt;em&gt;reponame&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are officially done creating your repository&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;if you have an existing repo, or have finished setting it up&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure you've got Subversion installed on your local machine per the instructions above&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; Check out the repository to your local machine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cd /repos/on/your/local/machine
$ svn co svn+ssh://www.myserver.com/path/to/directory/of/repositories/my_repository
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;svn co&lt;/em&gt; is the command you use to check out a repository&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3)&lt;/strong&gt; Create your initial directory structure (optional)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cd /repos/on/your/local/machine
$ cd my_repository
$ svn mkdir branches
$ svn mkdir tags
$ svn mkdir trunk
$ svn commit -m "Initial structure"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;svn mkdir&lt;/em&gt; runs a regular &lt;em&gt;mkdir&lt;/em&gt; and creates a directory in the present working directory with the name you supply after typing &lt;em&gt;svn mkdir&lt;/em&gt; and then adds it to the repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;svn commit -m ""&lt;/em&gt; sends your changes to the repository and updates it. Whatever you place in the quotes after &lt;em&gt;-m&lt;/em&gt; is the comment for this commit (make it count!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "working copy" of your code would go in the &lt;em&gt;trunk&lt;/em&gt; directory. &lt;em&gt;branches&lt;/em&gt; is used for working on individual projects outside of trunk; each directory in &lt;em&gt;branches&lt;/em&gt; is a copy of &lt;em&gt;trunk&lt;/em&gt; for a different sub project. &lt;em&gt;tags&lt;/em&gt; is used more releases. I suggest just focusing on &lt;em&gt;trunk&lt;/em&gt; for a while and getting used to Subversion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;working with your repo&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; Add code to your repository&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cd /repos/on/your/local/machine
$ svn add my_new_file.ext
$ svn add some/new/directory
$ svn add some/directory/*
$ svn add some/directory/*.ext
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second to last line adds every file in that directory. The last line adds every file with the extension .ext.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; Check the status of your repository&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cd /repos/on/your/local/machine
$ svn status
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That will tell you if there are any new files, and updated files, and files with conflicts (differences between your local version and the version on the server), etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3)&lt;/strong&gt; Update your local copy of your repository&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cd /repos/on/your/local/machine
$ svn up
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updating pulls any new changes from the server you don't already have&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;svn up&lt;/em&gt; does care what directory you're in. If you want to update your entire repository, makre sure you're in the root directory of the repository (above trunk)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's all you really need to know to get started. For more information I recommend you check out the &lt;a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Subversion Book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1, Install the source code/project/solution files into the 'Users' directory for Vista. That way when the user opens up the demo and compiles they have write access for generating the output files. If you put the files into the 'Program Files' directory under Vista you do not have write access and so the compile will just fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2, Add a shortcut to the solution to either the desktop or the start menu so that the user can then get access to it without having to know the exact location. Under Vista/XP when you install into the 'Users'/'Documents and Settings' directory it is not easy to find the installed files because they are placed inside a directory that is not shown unless you select 'Show Hidden Files' in file explorer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3, I would recommend you sign the installer using your publisher certificate so that when the user gets a UAC dialog on Vista they can see the name of the publiser and be more likely to continue with the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4, At the moment the split between Visual Studio 2005/2008 is about 50%/50% and so make sure you provide both versions of the project/solutions files. Alternatively just supply the VS2005 files and let the user upgrade using the wizard in VS2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, if you were doing it in C or C++ (or something similar), that's exactly what you'd do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears hacky, but that's actually an artifact of the language design. Remember, the actual algorithm you want to use is very simple: determine what instructions you want to use, load them into a buffer in memory, and jump to the beginning of that buffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you really try to do this, though, make sure you get the calling convention right when you return to your C program. I think if I wanted to generate code I'd look for a library to take care of that aspect for me. Nanojit's been in the news recently; you could look at that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python elects to make things like this explicit rather than based on a rule.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, since nothing is implied or assumed, parts of the implementation are exposed.  &lt;code&gt;self.__class__&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;self.__dict__&lt;/code&gt; and other "internal" structures are available in an obvious way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, they make stuff super-easy, and allow you to focus on the important part, actually programming the logic (rather then doing all the repetitive junk).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second off, it allows the site to be more maintainable, and the code more readable, so you can fix bugs faster, and add new features rapidly. Also, since there's a lot of code reuse involved when you use a framework, you don't have to do find and replace all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, if you use a framework it will improve security, because the framework will have tons of stuff that will prevent you from having SQL injection holes. Django is a good example, because it prevents XSS in it's templating system, SQL injections in the Models system, and even has a contrib addon for preventing CSRF. Now, if there's a vulnerability in your app's logic, then you'll have a problem, but those are easy to catch (since frameworks make code more readable).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, if you use a framework, and you decide to change database backends, you can do so easily (depending on which database backnds your framework of choice supports). Many frameworks also offer some sort of caching api, so as your site grows, you can add in extra performance boosts.&lt;/p&gt;

A classic metric is tracking bug activity. One team I worked with made their numbers look great by just grouping similar bugs under one bug.

&lt;p&gt;The best-practices way: Just implement a static utility class that provides a method that does the model look-up, taking the RouteData from the action as a parameter.  Then, call this method from all actions that require the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kludgy way, for only if every single action in every single controller needs the model, and you really don't want to have an extra method call in your actions: In your Controller-implementing-base-class, override ExecuteCore(), use the RouteData to populate the model, then call the base.ExecuteCore().&lt;/p&gt;

Content objects then send ObjectAdded/ObjectModified/ObjectRemoved events, and an event subscriber listens for these events and is responsible for updating the metadata table (in Django events are named signals). Then there is a Browser View exposed at a fixed URL that searches the metadata and returns the appropriate LiveSearch HTML, and finally each HTML page is sent the appropriate JavaScript to handle the autocomplete AJAX functionality to query this view and slot the resulting HTML results into the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want your LiveSearch to query multiple Models/Content Types, you are likely going to need to send your own events and have a subscriber handle them appropriately. This isn't necessary for a smaller data sets or lower traffic sites, where the performance penalty for doing multiple queries for a single search isn't a concern (or you only want to search a single content type) and you can just do several queries from your View.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the JavaScript side, you can roll-your-own or use an existing JavaScript library. This is usually called autocomplete in the JS library. There is YUI autocomplete and Scriptaculous autocomplete for starters, and likely lots more JavaScript autocomplete implementations out there.

&lt;p&gt;Write a Perl sub that takes &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; lists, and then returns 2^&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;-1 lists telling you which items are in which lists; that is, which items are only in the first list, the second, list, both the first and second list, and all other combinations of lists. Assume that &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; is reasonably small (less than 20).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;list_compare([1, 3], [2, 3]);
  =&amp;gt; ([1], [2], [3]);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, the first result list gives all items that are only in list 1, the second result list gives all items that are only in list 2, and the third result list gives all items that are in both lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;list_compare([1, 3, 5, 7], [2, 3, 6, 7], [4, 5, 6, 7])
  =&amp;gt; ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7])
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, the first list gives all items that are only in list 1, the second list gives all items that are only in list 2, and the third list gives all items that are in both lists 1 and 2, as in the first example. The fourth list gives all items that are only in list 3, the fifth list gives all items that are only in lists 1 and 3, the sixth list gives all items that are only in lists 2 and 3, and the seventh list gives all items that are in all 3 lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually give this problem as a follow up to the subset of this problem for &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;=2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the solution? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow-up: The items in the lists are strings. There might be duplicates, but since they are just strings, duplicates should be squashed in the output. Order of the items in the output lists doesn't matter, the order of the lists themselves does.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Id="68357" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="26903" CreationDate="2008-09-16T00:54:28.360" Score="3" Body="&lt;p&gt;So you need a &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; that can create instances of an unknown type that implements an interface. You've got basically three options: a factory object, a Type object, or a delegate. Here's the givens:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public interface IInterface
{
    void DoSomething();
}

public class Foo : IInterface
{
    public void DoSomething() { /* whatever */ }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Type is pretty ugly, but makes sense in some scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public IInterface CreateUsingType(Type thingThatCreates)
{
    ConstructorInfo constructor = thingThatCreates.GetConstructor(Type.EmptyTypes);
    return (IInterface)constructor.Invoke(new object[0]);
}

public void Test()
{
    IInterface thing = CreateUsingType(typeof(Foo));
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem with it, is that at compile time, you have no guarantee that Foo actually &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; a default constructor. Also, reflection is a bit slow if this happens to be performance critical code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common solution is to use a factory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public interface IFactory
{
    IInterface Create();
}

public class Factory&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; where T : IInterface, new()
{
    public IInterface Create() { return new T(); }
}

public IInterface CreateUsingFactory(IFactory factory)
{
    return factory.Create();
}

public void Test()
{
    IInterface thing = CreateUsingFactory(new Factory&amp;lt;Foo&amp;gt;());
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above, IFactory is what really matters. Factory is just a convenience class for classes that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; provide a default constructor. This is the simplest and often best solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third currently-uncommon-but-likely-to-become-more-common solution is using a delegate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public IInterface CreateUsingDelegate(Func&amp;lt;IInterface&amp;gt; createCallback)
{
    return createCallback();
}

public void Test()
{
    IInterface thing = CreateUsingDelegate(() =&amp;gt; new Foo());
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantage here is that the code is short and simple, can work with &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; method of construction, and (with closures) lets you easily pass along additional data needed to construct the objects.&lt;/p&gt;

Database size matters primarily for scaling, in my opinion (you can write a very simple app if you have a very simple schema, even if there are hundreds of thousands of rows in the database).  The feature list will probably determine the number and complexity of UI pages, which will in turn help to dictate the code length.&lt;/p&gt;

As an example, Haskell makes use of significant indentation, and (to my knowledge) its grammar is context-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of source requiring a context-sensitive grammar could be this snippet from Ruby:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;my_essay = &amp;lt;&amp;lt; END_STR
This is within the string
END_STR

&amp;lt;&amp;lt; self
  def other_method
    ...
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example would be Scala's XML mode:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def doSomething() = {
  val xml = &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;def val &amp;lt;tag/&amp;gt; class&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
  xml
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a general rule, context-sensitive languages are slightly harder to imagine in any precise sense and thus far less common.  Even Ruby and Scala don't &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; count since their context sensitive features encompass only a minor sub-set of the language.  If I were you, I would formulate my grammar as inspiration dictates and then worry about parsing methodologies at a later date.  I think you'll find that whatever you come up with will be naturally context-free, or very close to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a final note, if you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need context-sensitive parsing tools, you might try some of the less rigidly formal techniques.  Parser combinators are used in Scala's parsing.  They have some annoying limitations (no lexing), but they aren't a bad tool.  LL(*) tools like ANTLR also seem to be more adept at expressing such "ad hoc" parsing escapes.  Don't try to use Yacc or Bison with a context-sensitive grammar, they are far to strict to express such concepts easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trigger the rotate on 'first access after midnight'. Assumes some sort of initiating event (eg user access)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the OS scheduling capabilities to trigger the rotate (cron on *nix, at/task scheduler on Windows)&lt;/li&gt;

They're much easier to setup and work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try mercurial (which is the VCS that I used to understand how version control works) and then if you like you can even move to git.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a really nice introductory tutorial on Mercurial's homepage: &lt;a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/UnderstandingMercurial" rel="nofollow"&gt;Understanding Mercurial&lt;/a&gt;.

Finally, you have a free ebook that is a really great reference on how to use Mercurial: &lt;a href="http://hgbook.red-bean.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Distributed Revision Control with Mercurial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're feeling more adventurous and want to start off with Git straight away, then this free ebook is a great place to start: &lt;a href="http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~blynn/gitmagic/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Git Magic&lt;/a&gt; (Very easy read)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the end&lt;/strong&gt;, no matter what VCS tool you choose, what you'll end up doing is the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a repository that you don't manually edit, it only for the VCS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a working directory, where you make your changes as usual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change what you like, press F5 as many times as you wish. When you like what you've done and think you would like to save the project the way it is at that very moment (much like you would do when you're, for example, writing something in Word) you can then commit your changes to the repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you ever need to go back to a certain state in your project you now have the power to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's pretty much it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model stuff is fairly easy, I just have to include the module at the beginning, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Iso &amp;lt; Sale
  include Shared::TracksSerialNumberExtension
  include Shared::OrderLines
  extend  Shared::Filtered
  include Sendable::Model

  validates_presence_of   :customer
  validates_associated    :lines

  owned_by :customer

  def initialize( params = nil )
    super
    self.created_at ||= Time.now.to_date
  end

  def after_initialize
  end

  order_lines             :despatched

  # tracks_serial_numbers   :items
  sendable :customer

  def created_at=( date )
    write_attribute( :created_at, Chronic.parse( date ) )
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is working fine, now however, I'm going to have some controller and view code that's going to be common between these models as well, so far I have this for my sendable stuff:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# This is a module that is used for pages/forms that are can be "sent"
# either via fax, email, or printed.
module Sendable
  module Model
    def self.included( klass )
      klass.extend ClassMethods
    end

    module ClassMethods
      def sendable( class_to_send_to )
        attr_accessor :fax_number,
                      :email_address,
                      :to_be_faxed,
                      :to_be_emailed,
                      :to_be_printed

        @_class_sending_to ||= class_to_send_to

        include InstanceMethods
      end

      def class_sending_to
        @_class_sending_to
      end
    end # ClassMethods

    module InstanceMethods
      def after_initialize( )
        super
        self.to_be_faxed    = false
        self.to_be_emailed  = false
        self.to_be_printed  = false

        target_class = self.send( self.class.class_sending_to )
        if !target_class.nil?
          self.fax_number     = target_class.send( :fax_number )
          self.email_address  = target_class.send( :email_address )
        end
      end
    end
  end # Module Model
end # Module Sendable
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically I'm planning on just doing an include Sendable::Controller, and Sendable::View (or the equivalent) for the controller and the view, but, is there a cleaner way to do this?  I 'm after a neat way to have a bunch of common code between my model, controller, and view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Just to clarify, this just has to be shared across 2 or 3 models.&lt;/p&gt;

At some point, your project gets so expansive, that you actually get slowed down by the shortcomings of the framework.

I have seen many times where people were held back in the decisions they could make, or the work they could produce, because they were trying to do something that the framework didn't anticipate.  And doing these things that the framework doesn't anticipate can be very troublesome.  The nice thing about making your own framework, is that it can evolve with your project, to be a help to you system, instead of a hindrance.&lt;/p&gt;

If it is in Oracle, to further increase performance I'd recommend partitioning the table by creating a list partition on is_deleted column.
Then deleted and non-deleted rows will physically be in different partitions, though for you it'll be transparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, if you type a query like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT * from table_name where is_deleted = 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then Oracle will perform the 'partition pruning' and only look into the appropriate partition. Internally a partition is a different table, but it is transparent for you as a user: you'll be able to select across the entire table no matter if it is partitioned or not. But Oracle will be able to query ONLY the pertition it needs. For example, let's assume you have 1000 rows with IS_DELETED=0 and 100000 rows with IS_DELETED=1, and you partition the table on IS_DELETED. Now if you include condition&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;WHERE ... AND IS_DELETED=0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then Oracle will ONLY scan the partition with 1000 rows. If the table weren't partitioned, it would have to scan 101000 rows (both partitions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Control+1 for error fixing - it knows how to fix most compile errors - just highlight the error in the code (which will be underlined in red) and it will give you a list of suggestions. Control+1 selects the first suggestion, which is almost always correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use this error fixing feature to write code that uses methods you haven't written yet - the error fixing will create the method on the class/interface you called it on, with the correct parameters/name/visibility etc. Or, if theres a similarly named method with similar parameters, it will suggest you've spelt it wrong when you called it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The refactoring tools are also supergreat - you can highlight a block of code to extract as a method, and it'll work out what variables need to be passed in, and what it should return (if anything). You can move variables between field and methods. You can change class/interface/variable names, and it will correct them only where it needs to (which beats a search and replace any day).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You really don't need to know many eclipse features to get the benefit of using it - and it'll dramatically speed up your coding. I wish I'd known how to use it at University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, I'd recommend Eclipse. The time saved coding will make up for having to click "yes" a couple times when you start a project..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Construct a hash whose keys are the union of all the elements in the input lists, and the values are bit strings, where bit &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; is set if the element is present in list &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;. The bit strings are constructed using bitwise or. Then, construct the output lists by iterating over the keys of the hash, adding keys to the associated output list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sub list_compare {
    my (@lists) = @_;
    my %compare;
    my $bit = 1;
    foreach my $list (@lists) {

        $bit *= 2; # shift over one bit
    }


    my @output_lists;
    foreach my $item (keys %compare) {
        push @{ $output_lists[ $compare{$item} - 1 ] }, $item;
    }

    return \@output_lists;

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ mkdir /tmp/new
$ cd !!:*
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, in lieu of using find, I'll break-out a one-line loop if I need to run a bunch of commands on a list of files.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for file in *.wav; do lame "$file" "$(basename "$file" .wav).mp3" ; done;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Configuring the command-line history options in my .bash_login (or .bashrc) is really useful.  The following is a cadre of settings that I use on my Macbook Pro. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting the following makes bash erase duplicate commands in your history:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;export HISTCONTROL="erasedups:ignoreboth"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also jack my history size up pretty high too.  Why not?  It doesn't seem to slow anything down on today's microprocessors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;export HISTFILESIZE=500000
export HISTSIZE=100000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that I do is ignore some commands from my history.  No need to remember the exit command. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;export HISTIGNORE="&amp;amp;:[ ]*:exit"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You definitely want to set histappend.  Otherwise, bash overwrites your history when you exit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;shopt -s histappend
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option that I use is cmdhist.  This lets you save multi-line commands to the history as one command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;shopt -s cmdhist
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, on Mac OS X (if you're not using vi mode), you'll want to reset &amp;lt;CTRL&amp;gt;-S from being scroll stop.  This prevents bash from being able to interpret it as forward search. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;stty stop ""
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I use Gnome Terminal, you may need to change the escape codes for other terminal emulators.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bash completion is also incredibly useful, but it's a far more subtle addition. In &lt;code&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Works nicely with this also in &lt;code&gt;~/.inputrc&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A web app is two things: SELECT actions and CRUD actions. Most web apps are 99% SELECT, and 1% CRUD. Normalization tends to help CRUD much more than SELECT. You might look at my schema and panic, but it's fast. You will have to do a small amount of extra work for any CRUD activity, but your SELECTS will be so much faster because all of your SELECTS can hit the Stay table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like how Jeff Atwood puts it: "Normalize until it hurts, denormalize until it works"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a website used by a busy hotel manager, how well it works is just as important as how fast it works.&lt;/p&gt;

(It doesn't have to be a "ZIP" exactly, but some type of readily available container file type is better than writing your own) Like OO.org and Office 2K7 you can just use a custom extension and designate your app as the handler. This will also work on Macs, so it can be cross-platform. It may not be fast however. Using low or no compression may help with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools can't solve this for you, unless the specific tool is your email or IM client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's the same as if you were making any other major change in a shared project -- you need to be able to tell your coworkers/collaborators "hey, hands off for a couple of hours, I have a big change to the FooBar module coming in".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternately, if you're going to be making a change so major that it has the potential to cause huge merge conflicts with the work of 10 other people, run the change by them beforehand. Have a code review. Ask for architectural input. Then, when you're as close to consensus as you're likely to get, take that virtual lock on the section of the repository you need, check in your changes, and send out an all-clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not a perfect solution, but it's as close as you'll get. Lots of source control systems support explicit locks on sections of the source base, but I've never really seen those lead to good results in these areas. It's a social problem, and you only really need to resort to technical solutions if you can't trust the people you're working with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: As of jQuery 1.8, the documentation states that &lt;code&gt;.ajaxStart/Stop&lt;/code&gt; should only be attached to &lt;code&gt;document&lt;/code&gt;. This would transform the above snippet to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var $loading = $('#loadingDiv').hide();
$(document)
  .ajaxStart(function () {
    $loading.show();
  })
  .ajaxStop(function () {
    $loading.hide();

Take a portion of code and look at all of the external interfaces.  You have to absolutely make sure that these don't change.  Now that you have defined that start to look at the internal structure of it and slowly change it around.  You'll have to work in small steps and check in frequently to avoid massive merge conflicts, which is one of the biggest problems you're going to have to work against.  In a team that size you'll never be able to check everything out and magically make it all better for them.  You might want to let people know ahead of time what you are going to do.  (which you should always plan out what you do before you do it anyway).  If other people are working on it, let them know what is going to change and how it will affect the class etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest thing you're going to have find out before you start trying is if people are on board with you.  If not, it might be a lost cause and will cause strife.  In this case, bad code and a functioning team that understands the mess the way it is might be better than refactored code.  In know this is counter intuitive, but a boss at my old job put it this way. He said the code is horrible, but it works, and the developers here know how it works, and that means the 1000 people using it can do their job which means we get to keep ours.

To make it a bit concrete, I'll throw in an example;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bob has been coding on a strategy game which supports "cool geographical effects". These round up to simple constraints such as if troops are walking in water, they are slowed 25%. If they are walking on grass, they are slowed 5%, and if they are walking on pavement they are slowed by 0%.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now, management told Bob that they needed new sorts of troops. There would be jeeps, boats and also hovercrafts. Also, they wanted jeeps to take damage if they went drove into water, and hovercrafts would ignore all three of the terrain types. Rumor has it also that they might add another terrain type with even more features than slowing units down and taking damage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very rough pseudo code example follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public interface ITerrain
{
    void AffectUnit(IUnit unit);
}

public class Water : ITerrain

        }
        if (unit is Jeep)
        {
            unit.SpeedMultiplier = 0.70f;
            unit.Health -= 5.0f;
        }
        if (unit is Boat)
        {
            // Don't affect it anyhow
        }

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, things would have been better if Bob had a solid design document from the beginning. As the number of units and terrain types grow, so does code complexity. Not only does Bob have to worry about figuring out which members might need to be added to the unit interface, but he also has to repeat alot of code. It's very likely that new terrain types require additional information from what can be obtained from the basic IUnit interface. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each time we add another unit into the game, each terrain must be updated to handle the new unit. Clearly, this makes for a lot of repetition, not to mention the ugly runtime check which determines the type of unit being dealt with. I've opted out calls to the specific subtypes in this example, but those kinds of calls are neccessary to make. &lt;em&gt;An example would be that when a boat hits land, its propeller should be damaged. Not all units have propellers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am unsure what this kind of problem is called, but it is a many-to-many dependence  which I have a hard time decoupling. I don't fancy having 100's of overloads for each IUnit subclass on ITerrain as I would want to come clean with coupling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any light on this problem is highly sought after. Perhaps I'm thinking way out of orbit all together?&lt;/p&gt;

For the last 3 years I've had a few interships (once per year). The first two (in the same company) were mostly sysadmin jobs, but I did get to do a few Perl programs (mostly log file analysing and statistics generation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other intership was in the IT security field. I did a huge CGI Perl script to analyse time spent by users on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, what I really want to do is programming, but my interships were mostly sysadmins jobs with some programming (due to my previous experience with Linux and UNIX). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have another internship this winter, however I would like it to be in the OO programming field, and SW engineering. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a background in system administration but I know OO quite well, due to my college courses and projects (C++, Java, VB.NET, ASP.NET, but not C# unfortunately :( ). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is this : how can compete, in interviews, having no previous work experience in the OO field (though I build some projects in Java, Swing, etc., and am learning JSP right now), with other students with OO experience in previous interships?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should be my "selling points" ? I consider myself quite a good programmer, but my previous interviews didn't turn out well due to my lack of experience. In fact, I got an intership last winter in system administration, since, well... that's my background!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any tips on how to convince a potential employer that I am the perfect candidate despite my lack of professional experience (but lots of personal knowledge (and interest)) ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guillaume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[EDIT]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you all for your support!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not out of school yet ; I am still a full-time student! My university program is a cooperative one : I have to get 3 internships to get my diploma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let my explain briefly my background : this winter will be my 4th internship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first two were while I studied in CGEP, Quebec's post-high-school but pre-university schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one was pratically given to me by CGEP : a employer called in, searching for someone knowledgeable in Linux system administration. I fitted the job perfectly since I was the only student who knew Linux outside of school. My interview wasn't even a real one, since all the details had been discussed between my school and the employer : I knew that I was hired even before doing the interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second one was in the same company, one year later, since I liked my first one very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I arrived at my university, where every student is required to have 3 internships to get his (or her) diploma. Having no real experience in computer science interviews (since my first internships were "given" to me), I did a few screw-ups when doing interviews for OO jobs. I finally managed to get an interview for a security / sysadmin / Perl programming job at Bombardier Aerospace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My internship went well, but now I want a real software development job. All the people I know had one last winter, which mean I am disadvantaged in terms of experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I DO have programming experience. All my internship required me to do a substancial amount of programming, especially in Perl. My Perl skills are quite good, and I got to develop some nice tools for both companies I worked in. I solved real problems not seen in school (like how to parse efficiently 5 GB log files while keeping memory usage as low as possible).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I can easily get an internship this winter if I apply on jobs in the sysadmin domain or Linux world. There are a few of them available each year and I've got a lot of experience in the field, but as stated previously, I would like my next internship to be in SW development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently working on a personal project in Java, which is a small UML class editor. So I get to deal with the Swing framework, listeners, MVC architecture, etc. This is not as big as what is being done in the "real world", but it a fun project and I am having a lot of fun doing it, and if I can get it quite advance in the next month, I will probably put in on SourceForge. In the same time I am learning JSP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for OO open source project, this is something I should be looking into. I probably won't have time for it right now, one month away from my first interviews, being a full-time student, but I am not putting this option away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrap command-line programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use a Python library that provides SSH capabilities (eg - &lt;a href="http://www.lag.net/paramiko/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Paramiko&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedConch" rel="nofollow"&gt;Twisted Conch&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each approach has its own quirks. You will need to setup SSH keys to enable password-less logins if you are wrapping system commands like "ssh", "scp" or "rsync." You can embed a password in a script using Paramiko or some other library, but you might find the lack of documentation frustrating, especially if you are not familiar with the basics of the SSH connection (eg - key exchanges, agents, etc). It probably goes without saying that SSH keys are almost always a better idea than passwords for this sort of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: its hard to beat rsync if you plan on transferring files via SSH, especially if the alternative is plain old scp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've used Paramiko with an eye towards replacing system calls but found myself drawn back to the wrapped commands due to their ease of use and immediate familiarity. You might be different. I gave Conch the once-over some time ago but it didn't appeal to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If opting for the system-call path, Python offers an array of options such as os.system or the commands/subprocess modules. I'd go with the subprocess module if using version 2.4+.&lt;/p&gt;

Whether they wrote the tests first (as in TDD) or after they coded the functionality, I always tried to explain them all the benefits of having unit tests for code. Hardly anyone disagreed with me. You cannot disagree with something that is obvious, and any smart person will see the benefits of unit test and TDD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with unit testing is that it requires a behavioral change, and it is very hard to change people's behavior. With words, you will get a lot of people to agree with you, but you won't see many changes in the way they do things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to convince people by doing. Your personal success will atract more people than all the arguments you may have. If they see you are not just talking about unit test or TDD, but you are doing what you preach, and you are successful, people will try to imitate you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also take on a lead role because no one writes unit test right the first time, so you may need to coach them on how to do it, show them the way, and the tools available to them. Help them while they write their first tests, review the tests they write on their own, and show them the tricks, idioms and patterns you've learned through your own experiences. After a while, they will start seeing the benefits on their own, and they will change their behavior to incorporate unit tests or TDD into their toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changes won't happen over night, but with a little of patience, you may achieve your goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Rails only the "object" tables become models!

    }
    ...
    public virtual IList&amp;lt;Groups&amp;gt; groups{ get; set; }

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

.WithParentKeyColumn("UserID")
.WithChildKeyColumn("GroupID")
.Cascade.SaveUpdate();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I write a class for the join table that looks like this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    public virtual string PersonID { get; set; }
    public virtual bool WaitingForAccept { get; set; }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main problem with using a parser generator is that it is difficult to get good error recovery in the parser. If you plan on implementing an IDE for your language, then having good error recovery is important for getting things like Intellisence to work. Intellisence always works on incomplete syntactic constructs, and the better the parser is at figuring out what construct the user is trying to type, the better an intellisence experience you can deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you write a hand-written top-down parser, you can pretty much implement what ever rules you want, where ever you want to. This is what makes it easy to provide error recovery. It will also make it trivial for you to implement significant whitespace. You can simply store what the current indentation level is in a variable inside your parser class, and can stop parsing blocks when you encounter a token on a new line that has a column position that is less than the current indentation level. Also, chances are that you are going to run into ambiguities in your grammar. Most production languages in wide use have syntactic ambiguities. A good example is generics in C# (there are ambiguities around "&amp;lt;" in an expression context, it can be either a "less-than" operator, or the start of a "generic argument list"). In a hand-written parser solving ambiguities like that are trivial. You can just add a little bit of non-determinism where you need it with relatively little impact on the rest of the parser, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, because you are designing the language yourself, you should assume it's design is going to evolve rapidly (for some languages with standards committees, like C++ this is not the case). Making changes to automatically generated parsers to either handle ambiguities, or evolve the language, may require you to do significant refactoring of the grammar, which can be both irritating and time consuming. Changes to hand written parsers, particularly for top-down parsers, are usually pretty localized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say that parser generators are only a good choice if:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You never plan on writing an IDE ever,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The language has &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; simple syntax, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need a parser extremely quickly, and are ok with a bad user experience&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to fall through multiple case statements without stating case value: repeatedly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;switch (value)
{
   case 1:
   case 2:
   case 3:
      //do some stuff
      break;

   case 6:
      //do some different stuff
      break;
   default:
       //default stuff
      break;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but I'd like to do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;switch (value)
{
   case 1,2,3:
      //Do Something
      break;
   case 4,5,6:
      //Do Something
      break;
   default:
      //Do the Default
      break;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this syntax I'm thinking of from a different language, or am I missing something?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, take the time to start and/or get involved with some open source projects. Saying that you worked on an open source project says alot. First, it shows that you can grok other people's code and have the resolve to work collaboratively with other people in the programming community. This goes a long way. I have come across employers that actually skip the screening process when they can confirm that I contribute to various open source projects. This is probably your best defense against little experience in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have the experience/drive then do presentations and/or coding sessions at user group meetings and/or code camps. This also goes a LONG way. Displaying that you can talk and converse with other programmers in a scenario like this, it shows employers that you enjoy programming and working with the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, start low. You will need to start at the bottom of the totem pole, but work hard and show that you are a quality programmer and recruitors/employers will be banging down your door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FYI, the IBM Java 6 VM does contain an ahead-of-time compiler (AOT).  The code isn't quite as optimized as what the JIT would produce, but it is stored across VMs, I believe in some sort of persistent shared memory.  Its primary benefit is to improve startup performance.  The IBM VM by default JITs a method after it's been called 1000 times.  If it knows that a method is going to be called 1000 times just during the VM startup (think a commonly-used method like java.lang.String.equals(...) ), then it's beneficial for it to store that in the AOT cache so that it never has to waste time compiling at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd like to start migrating this application to use a much more expressive, transparent, and non-invasive persistence strategy, and given my company's previous experience with it, Hibernate 3.x is the obvious choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Migrating to Hibernate is going to take a while, as over 100 tables in the application use entity beans. So I'm looking at a phased approach where the two persistence strategies run in parallel, ideally on the same tables at the same time, if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are truly passionate about programming as you say, then just start programming. You can't learn how to program by thinking your way through it. The only way to get experience is to program.  For someone like yourself, find an open source project you want to help and start contributing.  That will give you valuable experience in using source control among other things.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing is find a technology that you feel you can really get behind and go deep on it, learn any and everything you can about that technology and that platform.  Immerse yourself.   The reason I say that is because someone isn't going to hire you if you know a little about this and a little about that.  They expect you to be able to walk in and do a job.  That doesn't mean you shouldn't "play" with other things, but do yourself a favor and leave them off your resume unless you have production experience with them.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could you clarify a few things? Are insertions and deletions happening only at the beginning or end of the list?
If modifications can occur at any point in the list, how should the enumeration behave when elements are removed or added near or on the location of the enumeration's current element?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is certainly doable by creating a custom IEnumerable object with perhaps an integer index, but only if you can control all access to your IList&amp;lt;&gt; object (for locking and maintaining the state of your enumeration).

&lt;p&gt;One thing I'd like to add is that remote X11 protocol is a remote access solution naturally supported by all X11-based systems. With the X11 forwarding feature of SSH, secure remote GUI becomes as easy as logging into a remote host over SSH and running the GUI application as you would run it locally. Instead of providing you with a window to a remote machine's desktop, remote X11 makes the window of the remote application appear on your local desktop, as if it were one of the applications running on your computer. (This is also, to some extent, possible over RDP.) The advantages and ease of use of remote X11 in a *NIX environment usually outweighs its bandwidth inefficiency (compared to RDP or VNC). Still, in my experience, remote X11 over SSH is very usable in a LAN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "trunk" is where the most current version of whatever is out in production is supposed to be placed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A "tag" is where a "copy to" occurs when a stream is complete and we need to store the status of the stream for archival purposes.  It also allows development to continue from a specific point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A "branch" is when something completely different than mainstream development is to take place.  Usually, branches are very rare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Streams" are what we most use.  A stream of development is a task-based focus, such as a stream for a particular fix or development effort (for instance, a change requests' completion).  Streams are allowed to merge with each other, but different streams are ranked based on svn strategy.  For instance, we had one stream for a cr release, and another stream for pushing out app support releases.  Since the CR stream had to incorporate the app support fixes in addition to its own changes, it was ranked higher.  Streams that are higher ranked have lower streams (as needed) merged into them.  Finally, a stream becomes production-ready.  It is tagged, and then "copied to" trunk, which is then used (normally, although sometimes tags are used) as the base for further streams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best use of streams, however, are for short tasks that take less than two weeks to complete.  These streams can be merged quickly into multiple, higher ranked streams, which then get merged later into any other higher ranked streams.  For example, since app support was lower than cr, any app support quick fix could be copied to a stream and then worked on, merged to app support which would then be merged to the cr stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scrollTop property is a available on any DOM element, including the document body. By setting it, you can control how far down something is scrolled. You can also use clientHeight and scrollHeight properties to see how much scrolling is needed (scrolling is possible when clientHeight (viewport) is less than scrollHeight (the height of the content).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use the offsetTop property to figure out where in the container an element is located.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build a truly general purpose "scroll into view" routine from scratch, you would need to start at the node you want to expose, make sure it's in the visible portion of it's parent, then repeat the same for the parent, etc, all the way until you reach the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One step of this would look something like this (untested code, not checking edge cases):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I print the value of binary data?  Is there a built-in or do I need to roll my own?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: This isn't the only value on the line, so I can't just PRINT @binvalue.  It's something more like PRINT N'other stuff' + ???? + N'more stuff'.  Not sure if that makes a difference: I didn't try just PRINT @binvalue by itself.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, if we have memory location 0x100 with the following content (hex bytes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
  0x100:  12 34 56 78 90 ab cd ef

Reads    Little Endian            Big Endian
 8-bit:  12                        12

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two situations where you need to mind endianess are with networking code and if you do down casting with pointers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TCP/IP specifies that data on the wire should be big endian. If you transmit types other than byte arrays (like pointers to structures), you should make sure to use the ntoh/hton macros to ensure the data is sent big endian.  If you send from a little-endian processor to a big-endian processor (or vice versa), the data will be garbled...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Casting issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
 uint32_t* lptr = 0x100;
 uint16_t  data;
 *lptr = 0x0000FFFF

 data = *((uint16_t*)lptr);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will be the value of data?
On a big-endian system, it would be 0  On a little-endian system, it would be FFFF&lt;/p&gt;

However you should definitely test your specific case (if the difference might impact the performance of your program --  remember "premature optimization is the root of all evil").&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python makes this very easy: &lt;a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-timeit.html"&gt;timeit&lt;/a&gt; is your friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ python -m timeit "x=(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)"

1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.363 usec per loop
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ python -m timeit -s "x=(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)" "y=x[3]"
10000000 loops, best of 3: 0.0938 usec per loop

$ python -m timeit -s "x=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]" "y=x[3]"
10000000 loops, best of 3: 0.0649 usec per loop
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in this case, instantiation is almost an order of magnitude faster for the tuple, but item access is actually somewhat faster for the list! So if you're creating a few tuples and accessing them many many times, it may actually be faster to use lists instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course if you want to &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; an item, the list will definitely be faster since you'd need to create an entire new tuple to change one item of it (since tuples are immutable).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;Dots in incoming variable names&lt;/h3&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Typically, PHP does not alter the
  names of variables when they are
  passed into a script. However, it
  should be noted that the dot (period,
  full stop) is not a valid character in
  a PHP variable name. For the reason,
  look at it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?php
$varname.ext;  /* invalid variable name */
?&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Now, what
  the parser sees is a variable named
  $varname, followed by the string
  concatenation operator, followed by
  the barestring (i.e. unquoted string
  which doesn't match any known key or
  reserved words) 'ext'. Obviously, this
  doesn't have the intended result.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;For this reason, it is important to
  note that PHP will automatically
  replace any dots in incoming variable
  names with underscores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's from &lt;a href="http://ca.php.net/variables.external"&gt;http://ca.php.net/variables.external&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, according to &lt;a href="http://ca.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.external.php#81080"&gt;this comment&lt;/a&gt; these other characters are converted to underscores:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The full list of field-name characters that PHP converts to _ (underscore) is the following (not just dot):&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;chr(32) ( ) (space)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;chr(46) (.) (dot)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;chr(91) ([) (open square bracket)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;chr(128) - chr(159) (various)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it looks like you're stuck with it, so you'll have to convert the underscores back to dots in your script using &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/68651/can-i-get-php-to-stop-replacing-characters-in-get-or-post-arrays#68667"&gt;dawnerd's suggestion&lt;/a&gt; (I'd just use &lt;a href="http://php.net/str_replace"&gt;str_replace&lt;/a&gt; though.)&lt;/p&gt;

Depending upon which version of Visual Studio you use you end up with a different compiler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Targeting a framework refers to specifically which version of the framework you wish to target during the compilation process; targeting frameworks is a new feature of Visual Studio 2008.  For instance I could have a solution open in Visual Studio 2008 and target v2.0 of .Net.  The result would be that I wouldn't have any of the 3.0 or 3.5 .Net features available to me during that compilation, for example WPF.&lt;/p&gt;

We find that it's more streamlined, nicer to code in, and better supported. I have in the past used Spring and found it to be very confusing, and not as well documented as EJB3 (or JPA I guess at the end of the day)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of EJB3 you no longer have to deal with external config files, and there's only one POJO that you annotate per database table. This POJO can be passed to your web tier without any problems. IDEs like Netbeans can even auto-generate these POJOs for you. We've used EJB3 now as the back end for quite a few large scale applications, and haven't noticed any performance problems.
Your Session Beans can be easily exposed as web services which you could expose to your Flex frontend.
Session beans are easy to lock down at either a method or class level to assign roles and things like that if you need to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't speak that much about spring, as I only tried it out for a few weeks. But my overall impression of it was very poor. That doesn't mean it's bad framework, but our team here has found EJB3 to be the best for the persistence/business layer.&lt;/p&gt;

But I teach a first semester Linux admin course in which we install/configure several distributions, and I usually start with Ubuntu since it's generally the smoothest and requires minimal tweaking after the install. Last Friday, however, a number of students ran into the 82% problem - that is, their installs either hung temporarily (10 minutes to an hour) or failed at 82%. The simplest solution, and the only one they could implement and understand in the second week of classes, was to pull the network cable and restart the install. Although this will work well for me as an example of the kind of troubleshooting one often has to do when installing/configuring Linux, it is also the sort of thing that discourages casual users - and students who are new to Linux. Prior to this, though, Ubuntu has installed flawlessly the last four times I taught the course.....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To set data in the clipboard, you have to &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms649048(VS.85).aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;open it&lt;/a&gt; first.  Only one process can have the clipboard open at a time.  So, when you check, if another process has the clipboard open &lt;em&gt;for any reason&lt;/em&gt;, your attempt to open it will fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just so happens that Terminal Services keeps track of the clipboard, and on older versions of Windows (pre-Vista), you have to open the clipboard to see what's inside... which ends up blocking you.  The only solution is to wait until Terminal Services closes the clipboard and try again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important to realize that this is not specific to Terminal Services, though: it can happen with anything.  Working with the clipboard in Win32 is a giant race condition.  But, since by design you're only supposed to muck around with the clipboard in response to user input, this usually doesn't present a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

PRINT @s

&lt;p&gt;First, do rounds of refactoring where you stay in AS2, but get as close to AS3 architecture as you can. Naturally this includes moving all your frame scripts and #include scripts into packages and classes, but you can do more subtle things like changing all your event listeners and dispatchers to follow the AS3 flow (using static class properties for event types, and registering by method rather than by object). You'll also want to get rid of all your "built-in" events (such as onEnterFrame), and you'll want to take a close look at nontrivial mouse interaction (such as dragging) and keyboard interaction (such as detecting whether a key is pressed). This phase can be done incrementally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second phase is to convert from AS2 to AS3 - changing "_x" to "x", and all the APIs, and so on. This can't be done incrementally, you have to just do as much as you can in one fell swoop and then start fixing all the compile errors. For this reason, the more you can do in the first phase, the more pain you avoid in the second phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process has worked for me on a reasonably large project, but I should note that the first phase requires a solid understanding of how AS3 is structured. If you're new to AS3, then you'll probably need to try building some of the functionality you'll need to be porting. For example, if your legacy code uses dragging and drop targets, you'll want to try implementing that in AS3 to understand how your code will have to change structurally. If you then refactor your AS2 with that in mind, the final syntax changes should go smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest pitfalls for me were the parts that involved a lot of attaching, duplicating and moving MovieClips, changing their depths, and so on. All that stuff can't really be rearchitected to look like AS3; you have to just mash it all into the newer way of thinking and then start fixing the bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final note - I really wouldn't worry about stuff like import and override statements, at least not to the point of automating it. If you miss any, it will be caught by the compiler. But if you miss structural problems, you'll have a lot more pain.&lt;/p&gt;

This means that the compiler library shipped with your compiler (libgcc in this case) contains an implementation of the function.  The compiler will allow an implicit declaration (i.e., using the function without a header), and the linker will find the implementation in the compiler library because you're probably using the compiler as a linker front-end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try compiling your objects with the '-c' flag (compile only, no link), and then link them directly using the linker.  You will find that you get the linker errors you expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, gcc supports options to disable the use of intrinsics: &lt;code&gt;-fno-builtin&lt;/code&gt; or for granular control, &lt;code&gt;-fno-builtin-function&lt;/code&gt;.  There are further options that may be useful if you're doing something like building a homebrew kernel or some other kind of on-the-metal app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, given these base classes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class Base
{
    public virtual void Go() { Console.WriteLine("in Base"); }
}

public class Derived : Base
{
    public virtual void Go() { Console.WriteLine("in Derived"); }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public void Test()
{
    Base obj = new Derived();
    obj.Go();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;will correctly output "in Derived" even though the reference "obj" is of type Base. This is because &lt;em&gt;at runtime&lt;/em&gt; C# will correctly find the most-derived Go() to call. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, since C# is a single dispatch language, it only does this for the "first parameter" which is implicitly "this" in an OOP language. The following code does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; work like the above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class TestClass
{
    public void Go(Base b)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Base arg");
    }

    public void Go(Derived d)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Derived arg");
    }

    public void Test()
    {
        Base obj = new Derived();
        Go(obj);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will output "Base arg" because aside from "this" all other parameters are &lt;em&gt;statically&lt;/em&gt; dispatched, which means they are bound to the called method at compile time. At compile time, the only thing the compiler knows is the declared type of the argument being passed ("Base obj") and not its actual type, so the method call is bound to the Go(Base b) one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A solution to your problem then, is to basically hand-author a little method dispatcher:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class Dispatcher
{
    public void Dispatch(IUnit unit, ITerrain terrain)
    {
        Type unitType = unit.GetType();
        Type terrainType = terrain.GetType();

        // go through the list and find the action that corresponds to the
        // most-derived IUnit and ITerrain types that are in the ancestor
        // chain for unitType and terrainType.
        Action&amp;lt;IUnit, ITerrain&amp;gt; action = /* left as exercise for reader ;) */

        action(unit, terrain);
    }

    // add functions to this
    public List&amp;lt;Action&amp;lt;IUnit, ITerrain&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Actions = new List&amp;lt;Action&amp;lt;IUnit, ITerrain&amp;gt;&amp;gt;();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use reflection to inspect the generic parameters of each Action passed in and then choose the most-derived one that matches the unit and terrain given, then call that function. The functions added to Actions can be anywhere, even distributed across multiple assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, I've run into this problem a few times, but never outside of the context of games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I call the Rave Endless Loop bug. In Rave Reports
version 6.5.0 (VCL10) that comes bundled with Delphi 2006, there is a
nortorious bug that plagues many Rave report developers. If you have a
non-empty dataset, and the data rows for this dataset fit exactly into a
page (that is to say there are zero widow rows), then upon PrintPreview,
Rave will get stuck in an infinite loop generating pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This problem has been previously reported in this newsgroup under the
following headings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In each of these postings, there was no response from Nevrona, and no
solution was reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possibly, the problem has also been reported on an allied newsgroup
(nevrona.public.rave.reports.general), to wit:

another problem. This posting did get a reply from Nevrona, but it was
more in relation to multiple regions ("There is a problem when using
multiple regions that go over a page-break.") than the problem of zero
widows.&lt;/p&gt;

SVN/CVS-&gt;email goes to all of the team members who partially out of curiosity will review submissions.  On top of this, code presentations by developers for major modules is effective at showcasing some of their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each check-in is tagged with the bug ID or feature request (for new code), and that allows some traceback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly QA's involvement means their testing of the code will provide some validation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the efficiency of the code, that's done a bit more statistically as we don't have the time to review algorithms.  Eventually I'd like to tie in our load testers to the process and have them run the automatic load tests more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here is my solution. It is more of a work-around than a good
long-term solution, and I hope that Nevrona will give this issue some
serious attention in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given your particular report layout, count the maximum number of rows
per page. Let us say that this is 40.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up a counter to count the rows within the page (as opposed to rows within the whole report). You could do this either by event script or by a CalcTotal component.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define an OnBeforePrint scripted event handler for the main data band.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this event handler set the FinishNewPage property of the main data band to be True when the row-per-page count is one or two below the max (in our example, this would be 38). And set it to False in all other cases. The effect of this is to give every page a non-zero number of widows (in this case 1..38), thus avoiding the condition that gives rise to the Rave Endless loop problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

  Digest::MD5.hexdigest("#{Time.now.to_f}--#{url}")

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function getObjectType( obj ) {  
    return obj.constructor.name;

window.onload = function() {  
    alert( getObjectType( "Hello World!" ) );

        // some code here...

&lt;p&gt;So instead of the tired old [Object object] you often get with the typeof keyword, you can actually get real object types based upon the constructor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another one is using variable arguments as a way to "overload" functions. All you are doing is using an expression to detect the number of arguments and returning overloaded output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function myFunction( message, iteration ) {  
    if ( arguments.length == 2 ) {  
        for ( i = 0; i &amp;lt; iteration; i++ ) {  
            alert( message );  
        }  
    } else {  
        alert( message );  
    }  
}  

window.onload = function() {  
    myFunction( "Hello World!", 3 );  
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I would say assignment operator shorthand. I learned this from the source of the jQuery framework... the old way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var a, b, c, d;
b = a;
c = b;
d = c;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new (shorthand) way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var a, b, c, d;
d = c = b = a;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware Solution&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use a free output pin on the processor and hook an oscilloscope or logic analyzer to the pin.  Initialize the pin to a low state, just before calling the function you want to measure, assert the pin to a high state and just after returning from the function, deassert the pin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
    *io_pin = 1;
    myfunc();
    *io_pin = 0;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bookworm solution&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the function is fairly small, and you can manage the disassembled code, you can crack open the processor architecture databook and count the cycles it will take the processor to execute every instructions.  This will give you the number of cycles required.&lt;br /&gt;
Time = # cycles * Processor Clock Rate / Clock ticks per instructions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is easier to do for smaller functions, or code written in assembler (for a PIC microcontroller for example)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timestamp counter solution&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some processors have a timestamp counter which increments at a rapid rate (every few processor clock ticks).  Simply read the timestamp before and after the function.
This will give you the elapsed time, but beware that you might have to deal with the counter rollover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take your case for an example, although code behind seems to have a better separation of concern, but the problem with it is that it may not separate out the concerns as clearly as you wish. Usually when we do the code behind stuff we are not building the apps in MVC framework. The code behind code is also not easy to maintain and test anyway, at least when compare to MVC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are building ASP.NET MVC apps then I think you are surely stuck with inline code. But building in MVC pattern is the best way to go about in terms of maintainability and testability.&lt;/p&gt;

For varying reasons (max message size, authentication methods) I need to manually define a number of settings in the WPF client's app.config for the service bindings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this means that when I update the service references in the project we end up with a mess - multiple bindings and endpoints. Visual Studio creates new bindings and endpoints with a numeric suffix (ie "Service1" as a duplicate of "Service"), resulting in an invalid configuration as there may only be a single binding per service reference in a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is easy to duplicate - just create a simple "Hello World" ASP.Net web service and WPF application in a solution, change the maxBufferSize and maxReceivedMessageSize in the app.config binding and then update the service reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment we are working around this by simply undoing checkout on the app.config after updating the references but I can't help but think there must be a better way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the 'spreadsheet conundrum' is a false dichotomy in this example: rows and columns are the presentation layer, not necessarily the data layer. The comments below tell me i misunderstood the analogy, but i don't think so - saying 'should this be a row or a column, which one is more likely to change' is forcing an unnecessary choice on the problem space - they are both equally likely to change. And in this specific example, this leads to choosing the wrong [yes &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;] paradigm for the solution. Dialing a phone is how old mechanical devices initiated a connection to another old mechanical device; this is hardly an apt analogy for modern telephony. And assuming that there is a 'user' to initiate the call simply moves the problem - although it moves it in the correct direction, i.e. away from the rotary-phone model ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at how the TAPI [sorry about the typo earlier, it's TAPI not ATAPI!] protocol works, there is a call controller - equivalent to the 'user' i suppose in some sense - that manages the connections between devices. One device does not call another, the call controller connects devices. So the example below is still essentially correct. It might be more correct to use a CallController object instead of a generic Connection, but the analogy should be clear enough as is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, a phone is a device with an address aka a 'phone number'. The 'dial' operator establishes a connection between the two devices. So the answer is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Phone p1 = new Phone(phoneNumber1);
Phone p2 = new Phone(phoneNumber2);
Connection conn = new Connection(p1,p2);
conn.Open();
//...talk
conn.Close();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this will support multi-party calls as well, by overloading Connection to include a list of devices or other connections, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Connection confCall = new Connection(p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6);
confCall.Open();

Connection joinCall = new Connection(confCall,p7,p8,conn);
joinCall.Open();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;look at the TAPI protocol for more examples&lt;/p&gt;

Case in point: I'm not sure what you specifically mean when you say "Flash" in your question. Is it Flash Player? The authoring tool? Or the whole collection of technologies that fall under what Adobe calls the "Flash Platform"? To help clear all this up, let me define the technologies involved in creating Flash and Flex content so that we're all using the same terminology here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flash Player&lt;/strong&gt; is a runtime for rich media content in the browser. There is also &lt;strong&gt;Flash Lite&lt;/strong&gt; to run Flash content on older or low-end mobile devices, and &lt;strong&gt;Adobe AIR&lt;/strong&gt; extends Flash Player to allow content authors to publish native desktop and mobile applications that can integrate with things like the file system, windowing systems, and device sensors like the accelerometer and camera. Collectively, Adobe refers to these as the &lt;strong&gt;Flash runtimes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flash Professional&lt;/strong&gt; (often called the &lt;strong&gt;Flash authoring tool&lt;/strong&gt; or the &lt;strong&gt;Flash IDE&lt;/strong&gt;) has traditionally been the primary application used to create content that runs on Flash Player. It is very designer oriented with timelines, layers, and visual drawing tools. Software developers may find this application disorienting and limited compared to other development tools that focus more on code, like Flash Builder (see below). When someone says, "I built something with Flash", they often mean the Flash authoring tool, but that's not always the case. For that reason, it's good to always clarify to avoid any confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ActionScript&lt;/strong&gt; is the primary programming language supported by Adobe to target Flash runtimes. The current version is ActionScript 3 (abbreviated as &lt;strong&gt;AS3&lt;/strong&gt;), which has been supported since Flash Player 9. Content created with older versions of ActionScript can still be run in the latest versions Flash Player, but new features are only supported when using ActionScript 3 to create new content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flex&lt;/strong&gt; is a collection of technologies designed to create rich applications that target the Adobe's Flash runtimes. Though saying "Flex" previously had the same ambiguity as "Flash", the Flex brand name is becoming more and more focused on the Flex framework and SDK, described below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Flex SDK&lt;/strong&gt; consists of compilers, a command-line debugger, and the Flex framework. The included compilers are:
1. MXMLC, an ActionScript and MXML compiler to output the final SWF file for deployment to Flash Player.
2. COMPC, a static library compiler for ActionScript that outputs SWC files.
3. ASDOC, a documentation generator built on the compiler technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Flex framework&lt;/strong&gt; is a collection of ActionScript classes designed to build Rich Internet Applications. It includes things like user interface controls, web services and other connectivity classes, formatters and validators, drag and drop, modal windowing, and component states. These classes are in the mx.* package. Generally, when developers say "Flex" without any clarifying information, they mean the Flex framework and not the product formerly known as Flex Builder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2011, Adobe donated the Flex SDK to the Apache Software Foundation. It is now called &lt;strong&gt;Apache Flex&lt;/strong&gt; and it is fully managed by the community rather than Adobe. However, Adobe employees continue to contribute to the project, and Flash Builder (see below) continues to support new SDKs released by the Apache Flex project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MXML&lt;/strong&gt; is an XML-based markup language used by the Flex compilers to make layout and placing components into containers easier. The tree-like structure of XML make the containment hierarchy easier to visualize. MXML is actually converted to ActionScript during the compilation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flash Builder&lt;/strong&gt; (formerly known as &lt;strong&gt;Flex Builder&lt;/strong&gt;) is a development environment that allows developers to build different project types to create SWF files that are deployed to Flash runtimes. It is built on the Eclipse platform and is more familiar to software engineers. Flash Builder supports projects built with Flex or pure ActionScript. Flex projects include the Flex framework. ActionScript projects are the most basic you can work with, starting with a single class and an empty canvas, and the Flex framework is not included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flash Builder does not replace Flash Professional. Some people who have traditionally used Flash Professional may now choose to use Flash Builder instead. Often, these are software engineers who appreciate or require the advanced development tools offered by Flash Builder or don't work heavily with assets designed in a visual tool. Some developers may write their code in Flash Builder, while choosing to compile their projects in the Flash authoring tool. Often, these developers are also designers, or they are working with other people who are designers. In this situation, there may be many graphical assets created in the Flash authoring tool, and it could be difficult or simply inappropriate to bring them into another environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Flex framework is specifically designed to build applications. It includes many traditional form controls (buttons, lists, datagrids, etc) and much of the code runs on an advanced component framework written in ActionScript. Not everyone is building the sort of content that Flex is designed to create, and Flex does not replace traditional Flash development practices for everyone. It is a better approach for some developers, but may not be right for others. More design-heavy websites, such as those created for movies, music, energy drinks, advertising campaigns, and things like that probably shouldn't use the Flex framework. These types of content might be better suited to Flash Professional or a pure ActionScript project in Flash Builder. Similarly, little widgets you put into the sidebar of your website or on your profile in a social networking website may need to be built with pure ActionScript (without the Flex framework) because they require a smaller file size and they probably don't need a big complex component architecture designed for larger applications. When targeting Flash runtimes, your development environment, frameworks, and workflow should be chosen based on your project's requirements and goals.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the fields in the Product table is a CategoryID that corresponds to this product's parent category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the form, the CategoryID needs to be represented as a combo box that is bound to the Category table.  The idea here is pretty straightforward: selecting a new Category should update the CategoryID in the Product table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem I'm running into is that selecting a new Category updates the CategoryName of the Category table instead of updating the CategoryID in the Product table.  The reason for this is that it seems that the combo box must be bound only to the CategoryName of the Category table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens is if the current product has a CategoryID of 12 which is the CategoryName "Chairs" in the Category table then selecting a new value, let's say "Tables" (CategoryID 13) in the combo box updates the CategoryID of 12 with the new CategoryName "Tables" instead of updating the Product table CategoryID to 13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I bind the Category table to a combox box so that the datatextfield (which I wish existed in Access) is the CategoryName and the datavaluefield is the CategoryID and only the CategoryID of the Product will be updated when the selected combo box item is changed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You an use the QueryPerformanceCounter() to get the value of a VERY FAST counter before and after your function. Then you substract those 64-bits values and get a delta "ticks". Using QueryPerformanceCounterFrequency() you can convert the "delta ticks" to an actual time unit. You can refer to MSDN documentation about those WIN32 calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Other embedded systems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without operating systems or with only basic OSes you will have to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;program one of the internal CPU timers to run and count freely. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;configure it to generate an interrupt when the timer overflows, and in this interrupt routine increment a "carry" variable (this is so you can actually measure time longer than the resolution of the timer chosen).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;before your function you save BOTH the "carry" value and the value of the CPU register holding the running ticks for the counting timer you configured.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;same after your function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;substract them to get a delta counter tick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;from there it is just a matter of knowing how long a tick means on your CPU/Hardware given the external clock and the de-multiplication you configured while setting up your timer. You multiply that "tick length" by the "delta ticks" you just got.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VERY IMPORTANT&lt;/strong&gt; Do not forget to disable before and restore interrupts after getting those timer values (bot the carry and the register value) otherwise you risk saving incorrect values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is very fast because it is only a few assembly instructions to disable interrupts, save two integer values and re-enable interrupts. The actual substraction and conversion to real time units occurs OUTSIDE the zone of time measurement, that is AFTER your function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may wish to put that code into a function to reuse that code all around but it may slow things a bit because of the function call and the pushing of all the registers to the stack, plus the parameters, then popping them again. In an embedded system this may be significant. It may be better then in C to use MACROS instead or write your own assembly routine saving/restoring only relevant registers.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would not issue SQL statement, but I would call stored procedures to perform the changes in the database, and create the audit log entry in an atomic transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UI (Access) does not need to know the inner works on the server. All it needs to do is request and update/insert/delete using the stored procedures you would create for this purpose. The server should handle the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retrieve a record set with ADO using a view with the hint NOLOCK implemented in the server and cache this data in Access for local display. Or retrieve a single record and lock only that row for editing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using linked tables your users will be locking each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With ADO connections you will not have the trouble to set ODBCs on every single client. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a table to set the server status. You application will check it before any action. you can use it to close the server to the application in case that you need to perform changes or maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extra bit shifts are not needed.  It is more efficient to not do a bit shift, as comparing the least significant bit is just as efficient as comparing the 2nd least significant bit, and so on.  Doing a bit shift as well is just doubling the bit operations needed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;firstbit = (x &amp;amp; 0x00000001) 
secondbit = (x &amp;amp; 0x00000002) 
thirdbit = (x &amp;amp; 0x00000004)   //&amp;lt;-- I'm not saying to store these values, just giving an example. 
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All operations on an x86 system anyway are done with 32-bit registers, so a single bit compare would be just as efficient as a 32-bit compare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention the overhead of having the loop itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem can be done in a constant number of lines of code and whether the code is run on an x86 or an x64, the way I describe is more efficient. &lt;/p&gt;

...     i = 3
...
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Test.i
3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few gotcha's here. Carrying on from the example above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = Test()
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t.i     # static variable accessed via instance
3
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t.i = 5 # but if we assign to the instance ...
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Test.i  # we have not changed the static variable
3
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t.i     # we have overwritten Test.i on t by creating a new attribute t.i
5
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Test.i = 6 # to change the static variable we do it by assigning to the class
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t.i
5
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Test.i
6
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; u = Test()
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; u.i
6           # changes to t do not affect new instances of Test

# Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Test.__dict__
{'i': 6, ...}
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t.__dict__
{'i': 5}
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; u.__dict__
{}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice how the instance variable &lt;code&gt;t.i&lt;/code&gt; got out of sync with the "static" class variable when the attribute &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; was set directly on &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;. This is because &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; was re-bound within the &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; namespace, which is distinct from the &lt;code&gt;Test&lt;/code&gt; namespace. If you want to change the value of a "static" variable, you must change it within the scope (or object) where it was originally defined. I put "static" in quotes because Python does not really have static variables in the sense that C++ and Java do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it doesn't say anything specific about static variables or methods, the &lt;a href="http://docs.python.org/tut/"&gt;Python tutorial&lt;/a&gt; has some relevant information on &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/classes.html"&gt;classes and class objects&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Steve Johnson also answered regarding static methods, also documented under "Built-in Functions" in the Python Library Reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Test(object):
    @staticmethod
    def f(arg1, arg2, ...):
        ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@beid also mentioned classmethod, which is similar to staticmethod. A classmethod's first argument is the class object. Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Test(object):
    i = 3 # class (or static) variable
    @classmethod
    def g(cls, arg):
        # here we can use 'cls' instead of the class name (Test)
        if arg &amp;gt; cls.i:
            cls.i = arg # would the the same as  Test.i = arg1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I suspect that by implementing GroupMembers, you will end up with some nasty collections in both your user and group classes. I.E. the group class will have the list of users and also a list of groupmembers which references a user and vice versa for the user class. To me this isn't that clean and will make it harder to maintain and propagate changes to the tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would suggest keeping the join table in the database as you have suggested, and add a List of groups called waitingtoaccept in users and (if it makes sense too) add List of users called waitingtoaccept in groups. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These would then pull their values from your join-table in the database based on the waitingtoaccept flag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;join an open-source project that uses OO and a language you know, and contribute to it significantly.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't be discouraged if you get turned down a lot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don't apply for jobs you don't really want&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expect to stay in the job for at least a year if not two or three, to really learn how to program in a non-academic environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;start your own business as a consultant, programmer, freelance, and/or develop products, and learn at your own pace. This is risky when out of school, less risky when in school, and if you happen on an unoccupied niche can be quite lucrative&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Only run the code once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I say that is because so much will make it variable and you might not even have control over it.  And what is your definition of time?  Suppose the operating system decides to put your process in the wait queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next you have unpredictability due to cache performance, memory latency, disk I/O, and so on.  These all boil down to one thing; sometimes it takes time to get the information into the processor where your code can use it.  Including the time it takes to fetch/decode your code itself.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, how much variance is acceptable to you?  It could be that you're okay with 40 milliseconds, or you're okay with 10 nanoseconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the application domain you can even further just mask over or hide the variance.  Computer graphics people have been rendering to off screen buffers for years to hide variance in the time to rendering each frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional solutions just remove as many known variable rate things as possible.  Load files into RAM, warm up the cache and avoid IO.&lt;/p&gt;

They have both D3D and OpenGL back ends.  &lt;a href="http://www.ogre3d.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.ogre3d.org&lt;/a&gt;
Basically their API kind of forces you into working in a D3D-ish way, creating buffer objects and stuffing them with data, then issuing draw calls on those buffers.  That's the way the hardware likes it anyway, so it's not a bad way to go.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then once you see how they do things, you might as well just just go ahead and use it and save yourself the trouble of having to re-implement all that it already provides.  :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I keep it clear in my mind and explain it to others is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose the right tool for what you want to create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to write an APPLICATION using Flash technology, use Flex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to create an ANIMATION using Flash techology, use traditional Flash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flex is optimized for application construction (but you can create primitive animations using states) and it compiles into a SWF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flash is optimized for animation construction but you can also create applications with some extra work, and it compiles into a SWF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have your SWF you can play in your Flash player, although Flex requires Flash 9 or higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Application -&gt; Flex -&gt; SWF&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Animation-&gt; Flash -&gt; SWF&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate IDs directly from the input data without throwing any bits away, and use a hash table that is large enough to hold all possible IDs. With 64-bit IDs, the latter will be extremely problematic: you will have to use a table that is smaller than your range of IDs, therefore you will have to deal with collisions. Even with 32-bit IDs, you would need well over 4GB of RAM to pull this off without collisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate IDs sequentially as you read in the vertices. Unfortunately, this makes it very expensive to search for previously read vertices in order to update their probabilities, since a sequential ID generator is not a hash function. If the amount of data used to construct the Markov chain is significantly smaller than the amount of data that the Markov chain is used to generate (or if they are both small), this may not be an issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you could use a hash table implementation that handles collisions for you (such as &lt;a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_map" rel="nofollow"&gt;unordered_map&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/hash_map.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;hash_map&lt;/a&gt;), and concentrate on the rest of your application.&lt;/p&gt;

Treat each JSP imported as a black box, and refactor these pages around them (iteratively, testing each change and making sure it works before continuing).  Once these are cleaned up, you can continue finding pages with more and more imports, until finally you have refactored the imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When refactoring, note the parts that try to access resources not given to the page and try to take this out to a controller.  For instance, anything that accesses the database should be inside a controller, let the JSP handle the display of the information the controller gives to it via a forward.  In this way you will develop several servlets, or things like servlets, for each page.  I would suggest using a front-controller based framework for this refactoring (from personal experience I recommend Spring and its Controller interface), so that each controller isn't a separate Servlet but is rather delegated to from a single servlet that is mapped appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the controller, it is better to do database hits all at once rather than attempt them piecemeal.  Users can and generally do tolerate a page load, but the page output will be much faster if all the database data is given to the rendering code rather than the rendering code hanging and not giving data to the client while it is trying to read yet another piece of data from the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel your pain and wish you luck in this endeavor.  Now, when you have to maintain an application that abuses Spring Webflow, that's another story :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding the position of the element you are scrolling to.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function absoluteOffset(elem) {
    return elem.offsetParent &amp;amp;&amp;amp; elem.offsetTop + absoluteOffset(elem.offsetParent);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function scrollToElement(elem) {
    window.scroll(absoluteOffset(elem));

The compiler will infer that the function returns an int and takes a unknown number of parameters.  This may work on some architectures, but it will fail if the function returns something other than int, like a structure, or if there are any parameter conversions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your example, sleep is seen and the compiler assumes a prototype like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int sleep();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the argument list is empty.  In C, this is NOT the same as void.  This actually means "unknown".  If you were writing K&amp;amp;R C code, you could have unknown parameters through code like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int sleep(t)
int t;
{
   /* do something with t */
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all dangerous, especially on some embedded chips where the way parameters are passed for a unprototyped function differs from one with a prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: prototypes aren't needed for linking.  Usually, the linker automatically links with a C runtime library like glibc on Linux.  The association between your use of sleep and the code that implements it happens at link time long after the source code has been processed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd suggest that you use the feature of your compiler to require prototypes to avoid problems like this.  With GCC, it's the -Wstrict-prototypes command line argument.  In the CodeWarrior tools, it was the "Require Prototypes" flag in the C/C++ Compiler panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excellence in programming demands an investment of mental energy and a dedication to continued learning comparable to the professions of medicine or law. It pays a fraction of what those professions pay, much less the wages paid to the mathematically savvy who head into the finance sector. And wages for &lt;em&gt;constructing code&lt;/em&gt; are eroding because it's a profession that is &lt;em&gt;relatively&lt;/em&gt; easy for the intelligent and self-disciplined in most economies to enter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programming has already eroded to the point of paying less than, say, plumbing. Plumbing can't be "offshored." You don't need to pay $2395 to attend the Professional Plumber's Conference every other year for the privilege of receiving an entirely new set of plumbing technologies that will take you a year to learn. &lt;/p&gt;

Study business, know enough about programming to refine your BS detector: brilliant. But dedicating the lion's share of your mental energy to the mastery of libraries, data structures, and algorithms? That only makes sense if programming is something more to you than an economic choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; programming and for that reason intend to make it your career, then it behooves you to develop a cold-eyed understanding of the forces that are, and will continue, to make it a harder and harder profession in which to make a living.

&lt;p&gt;You can easily do it with query-replace, like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;m-x (query-replace " -option" "^Q^J    -option")&lt;/p&gt;

the string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then just press 'y' for the strings to replace, and 'n' to skip the wierd
corner cases you'd find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another workhorse function is query-replace-regexp that can do
replacements of regular expressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and also grep-query-replace, which will perform query-replace by parsing
the output of a grep command.  This is useful because you can search
for "foo" in 100 files, then do the query-replace on each occurrence
skipping from file to file.&lt;/p&gt;

For embedded Linux, there are several ways you can accomplish.  If you wish to measure the amout of CPU time used by your function, you can do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;time.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt;

        for (j = 0; j &amp;lt; 1000; j++) {

        }

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

    struct timespec post;
    clock_gettime(CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID, &amp;amp;pre);

        (SEC_TO_NSEC(pre.tv_sec) + pre.tv_nsec));
    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need to link this with the realtime library, just use the following to compile your code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;gcc -o test test.c -lrt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may also want to read the man page on &lt;code&gt;clock_gettime&lt;/code&gt; there is some issues with running this code on SMP based system that could invalidate you testing.  You could use something like &lt;code&gt;sched_setaffinity()&lt;/code&gt; or the command line &lt;code&gt;cpuset&lt;/code&gt; to force the code on only one core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to measure user and system time, then you could use the &lt;code&gt;times(NULL)&lt;/code&gt; which returns something like a jiffies.  Or you can change the parameter for &lt;code&gt;clock_gettime()&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;CLOCK_MONOTONIC&lt;/code&gt;...but be careful of wrap around with &lt;code&gt;CLOCK_MONOTONIC&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there's the symbol table in your object files.  Usually, a C or C++ compiler compiles a single source file into an object file with a .obj or .o extension.  This contains a collection of executable code and data that the linker can process into a working application or shared library.  The object file has a data structure called a symbol table in it that maps the different items in the object file to names that the linker can understand.  If you call a function from your code, the compiler doesn't put the final address of the routine in the object file.  Instead, it puts a placeholder value into the code and adds a note that tells the linker to look up the reference in the various symbol tables from all the object files it's processing and stick the final location there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, there's also the symbol table in a shared library or DLL.  This is produced by the linker and serves to name all the functions and data items that are visible to users of the library.  This allows the system to do run-time linking, resolving open references to those names to the location where the library is loaded in memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you later change the 'Constants' class and you don't do a hard re-compile on other classes that reference that class, you will wind up with a combination of old and new values being used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of thinking of these as constants, think of them as configuration parameters and create a class to manage them.  Have the values be non-final, and even consider using getters.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure why my answer has been downvoted here.  If we program, we care about time complexity, and using two standard stacks to make a queue is inefficient.  It's a very valid and relevant point.  If someone else feels the need to downvote this more, I would be interested to know why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A little more detail&lt;/em&gt;: on why using two stacks is worse than just a queue: if you use two stacks, and someone calls dequeue while the outbox is empty, you need linear time to get to the bottom of the inbox (as you can see in Dave's code).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can implement a queue as a singly-linked list (each element points to the next-inserted element), keeping an extra pointer to the last-inserted element for pushes (or making it a cyclic list).  Implementing queue and dequeue on this data structure is very easy to do in constant time.  That's worst-case constant time, not amortized.  And, as the comments seem to ask for this clarification, worst-case constant time is strictly better than amortized constant time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're trying to measure the server side processing time only, you're going to have a difficult time factoring out the amount of time spent in network transit for your request to arrive and the response to return.  Otherwise, since you're managing the request yourself through a Socket, you can measure the elapsed time between any two moments by checking the System clock and computing the difference.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public void sendHttpRequest(byte[] requestData, Socket connection) {
    long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
    writeYourRequestData(connection.getOutputStream(), requestData);
    byte[] responseData = readYourResponseData(connection.getInputStream());
    long elapsedTime = System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime;
    System.out.println("Total elapsed http request/response time in milliseconds: " + elapsedTime);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This code would measure the time from when you begin writing out your request to when you finish receiving the response, and print the result (assuming you have your specific read/write methods implemented).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that dependency injection is all the rage, so it doesn't surprise me that @Mike Stone's haystack.find(needle, searcher) has been accepted. But I disagree: the choice of what searcher is used seems to me a decision for the haystack. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider two ISearchers: MagneticSearcher iterates over the volume, moving and stepping the magnet in a manner consistent with the magnet's strength. QuickSortSearcher divides the stack in two until the needle is evident in one of the subpiles. The proper choice of searcher may depend upon how large the haystack is (relative to the magnetic field, for instance), how the needle got into the haystack (i.e., is the needle's position truly random or it it biased?), etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have haystack.find(needle, searcher), you're saying "the choice of which is the best search strategy is best done outside the context of the haystack." I don't think that's likely to be correct. I think it's more likely that "haystacks know how best to search themselves." Add a setter and you can still manually inject the searcher if you need to override or for testing.&lt;/p&gt;

By using two lists in the way Brian describes, it is possible to implement a fast queue without requiring an obscene amount of copying.&lt;/p&gt;

If you are on line 5 and single step, you step to line 6.  With optimization on, you can get instruction re-ordering, loop unrolling and all sorts of optimizations.&lt;br&gt;
For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
void foo() {
1:  int i;
2:  for(i = 0; i &amp;lt 2; )
3:    i++;
4:  return;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, without optimization, you could single step through the code and hit lines 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With optimization on, you might get an execution path that looks like: 2, 3, 3, 4 or even just 4! (The function does nothing after all...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line, debugging code with optimization enabled can be a royal pain! Especially if you have large functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that turning on optimization changes the code! In certain environment (safety critical systems), this is unacceptable and the code being debugged has to be the code shipped. Gotta debug with optimization on in that case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the optimized and non-optimized code should be "functionally" equivalent, under certain circumstances, the behavior will change.&lt;br&gt;
Here is a simplistic example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
    int* ptr = 0xdeadbeef;  // some address to memory-mapped I/O device
    *ptr = 0;   // setup hardware device
    while(*ptr == 1) {    // loop until hardware device is done
       // do something
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With optimization off, this is straightforward, and you kinda know what to expect.
However, if you turn optimization on, a couple of things might happen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The compiler might optimize the while block away (we init to 0, it'll never be 1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of accessing memory, pointer access might be moved to a register-&gt;No I/O Update&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;memory access might be cached (not necessarily compiler optimization related)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all these cases, the behavior would be drastically different and most likely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just started to do unit testing.
For a long time I knew it would be good to start doing it but I had no idea how to start and more importantly what to test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we had to rewrite an important piece of code in our accounting program.
This part was very complex as it involved a lot of different scenarios.
The part I'm talking about is a method to pay sales and/or purchase invoices already entered into the accounting system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just didn't know how to start coding it, as there were so many different payment options.
An invoice could be $100 but the customer only transferred $99.
Maybe you have sent sales invoices to a customer but you have also purchased from that customer.
So you sold him for $300 but you bought for $100. You can expect your customer to pay you $200 to settle the balance.
And what if you sold for $500 but the customer pays you only $250?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I had a very complex problem to solve with many possibilities that one scenario would work perfectly but would be wrong on an other type of invocie/payment combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is where unit testing came to the rescue.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to write (inside the test code) a method to create a list of invoices, both for sales and purchases.
Then I wrote a second method to create the actual payment. 
Normally a user would enter that information through a user interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I created the first TestMethod, testing a very simple payment of a single invoice without any payment discounts.
All the action in the system would happen when a bankpayment would be saved to the database.
As you can see I created an invoice, created a payment (a bank transaction) and saved the transaction to disk.
In my asserts I put what should be the correct numbers ending up in the Bank transaction and in the linked Invoice.
I check for the number of payments, the payment amounts, the discount amount and the balance of the invoice after the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the test ran I would go to the database and double check if what I expected was there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After&lt;/strong&gt; I wrote the test, I started coding the payment method (part of the BankHeader class).
In the coding I only bothered with code to make the first test pass. I did not yet think about the other, more complex, scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran the first test, fixed a small bug until my test would pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I started to write the second test, this time working with a payment discount.
After I wrote the test I modified the payment method to support discounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While testing for correctness with a payment discount, I also tested the simple payment.
Both tests should pass of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then I worked my way down to the more complex scenarios.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Think of a new scenario   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Write a test for that scenario&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Run that single test to see if it would pass&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) If it didn't I'd debug and modify the code until it would pass. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) While modifying code I kept on running all tests&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how I managed to create my very complex payment method.
Without unit testing I did not know how to start coding, the problem seemed overwhelming.
With testing I could start with a simple method and extend it step by step with the assurance that the simpler scenarios would still work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sure that using unit testing saved me a few days (or weeks) of coding and is more or less guaranteeing the correctness of my method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I later think of a new scenario, I can just add it to the tests to see if it is working or not.
If not I can modify the code but still be sure the other scenarios are still working correctly.
This will save days and days in the maintenance and bug fixing phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, even tested code can still have bugs if a user does things you did not think of or prevented him from doing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are just some of tests I created to test my payment method.&lt;/p&gt;

There's an initial rush, which is great, but after a few days you start to wonder if it is worth the trouble.  You're taking an hour out of your day to change your clothes and run on a hamster wheel and you're not sure you're really gaining anything other than sore legs and arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, after maybe one or two weeks, just as the soreness is going away, a Big Deadline begins approaching.  You need to spend every waking hour trying to get "useful" work done, so you cut out extraneous stuff, like going to the gym.  You fall out of the habit, and by the time Big Deadline is over, you're back to square one.  If you manage to make it back to the gym at all, you feel just as sore as you were the first time you went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do some reading, to see if you're doing something wrong.  You begin feel a little bit of irrational spite toward all the fit, happy people extolling the virtues of exercise.  You realize that you don't have a lot in common.  They don't have to drive 15 minutes out of the way to go to the gym; there is one in their building.  They don't have to argue with anybody about the benefits of exercise; it is just something everybody does and accepts as important.  When a Big Deadline approaches, they aren't told that exercise is unnecessary any more than your boss would ask you to stop eating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, to answer your question, Unit Testing is usually worth the effort, but the amount of effort required isn't going to be the same for everybody.&lt;/strong&gt;  Unit Testing may require an enormous amount of effort if you are dealing with spaghetti code base in a company that doesn't &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; value code quality.  (A lot of managers will sing Unit Testing's praises, but that doesn't mean they will stick up for it when it matters.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are trying to introduce Unit Testing into your work and are not seeing all the sunshine and rainbows that you have been led to expect, don't blame yourself.  You might need to find a new job to really make Unit Testing work for you.&lt;/p&gt;

So any thing that looks like a function call, but not declared as function
will automatically take return value of 'int' and argument types depending
on the actuall call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However people later figured out that this can be very bad sometimes. So 
several compilers added warning. C++ made this error. I think gcc has some

&lt;p&gt;If you want to delete random items from a list efficiently, it needs to be doubly linked. If you want take items from the head of the list and add them at the tail, however, you don't need to doubly link the whole list. Singly link the list but make the next field of the last item on the list point to the first item on the list. Then make the list "head" point to the tail item (not the head). It is then easy to add to the tail of the list or remove from the head.&lt;/p&gt;

Conceptually local variables are allocated storage in a functions stack frame.  The symbol file generated by the compiler tells the debugger the offset of the variable in the stack frame, so the debugger can show it to you.  The debugger peeks at the memory location to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this means every time a local variable is changed the generated code for that source line has to write the value back to the correct location on the stack.  This is very inefficient due to the memory overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a release build the compiler may assign a local variable to a register for a portion of a function.  In some cases it may not assign stack storage for it at all (the more registers a machine has the easier this is to do).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the debugger doesn't know how registers map to local variables for a particular point in the code (I'm not aware of any symbol format that includes this information), so it can't show it to you accurately as it doesn't know where to go looking for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another optimization would be function inlining.  In optimized builds the compiler may replace a call to foo() with the actual code for foo everywhere it is used because the function is small enough.  However, when you try to set a breakpoint on foo() the debugger wants to know the address of the instructions for foo(), and there is no longer a simple answer to this -- there may be thousands of copies of the foo() code bytes spread over your program.  A debug build will guarantee that there is somewhere for you to put the breakpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

Setting breakpoints, single-stepping while watching variables, stack traces, and everything else you do in a debugger (IDE or otherwise) make sense if every line of non-empty, non-comment source code matches some machine code instruction.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most optimizations mess with the order of machine codes.  Loop unrolling is a good example.  Common subexpressions can be lifted out of loops.  With optimization turned on, even the simplest level, you may be trying to set a breakpoint on a line that, at the machine code level, doesn't exist.   Sometime you can't monitor a local variable due to it being kept in a CPU register, or perhaps even optimized out of existence!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a list looking like: ... -&gt; Node(i-1) -&gt; Node(i) -&gt; Node(i+1) -&gt; ... and we need to delete Node(i).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With CDT you should be sure to enable the "Full Indexing" option rather than the "Fast Indexing" default.  It's not perceptibly slower on modern hardware and it does a much better job.  In that vein, you should be sure to enable semantic highlighting.  This isn't as important in C/C++ as it is in a language like Scala, but it's still extremely useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streamlined Editing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get used to using Ctrl+O and Ctrl+Alt+H.  The former pops up an incrementally searchable outline view, while the latter opens the "Call Hierarchy" view and searches on the currently selected function.  This is incredibly useful for tracing execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ctrl+Shift+T (Open Type) isn't exactly an "editing" combo per se, but it is equally important in my workflow.  The C++ Open Type dialog not only allows incremental filtering by type, but also selecting of definition (&lt;code&gt;.h&lt;/code&gt;) or declaration (&lt;code&gt;.cpp&lt;/code&gt;) and even filtering by element type (&lt;code&gt;typedef&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt;, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default Eclipse workspace layout is extremely inefficient both in space and in usability.  Everyone has their favorite layout, take some time and find yours.  I like to minimize (not necessarily close) everything except for Outline and keep the C/C++ Project Explorer docked in the sidebar configured to precisely hide the Outline when expanded.  In this way I can always keep the editor visible while simultaneously reducing the space used by views irrelevant to the current task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;"Here the dragons lie" - any known minefields with products (esp. legacy), 'Don't tread here' areas that you need to be careful while changing.. e.g. If you change something here, make sure you have it reviewed by Y and Z before checking in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update from &lt;strong&gt;Dimarzionist&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/em&gt; Stash away decisions taken during development, reasons and supporting evidence (mail chains) if needed in a 'well-known place'&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the team finds that they have been drawing a class diagram or sequence diagram over and over, that's proof that it is a useful artifact. Soon someone will make a sticky copy and save it somewhere to save time. Over time , the more useful artifacts would build up. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't pester the team to churn out documents no one else will read...(No "This is mandated by the process")&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't create documents that are 40-50 pages long. No one will read them.. "Take more time and write a shorter letter" 5-6 pages max.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your comment on my other answer got me to thinking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When you load an HTML file with DOMDocument, it appears to do some level of cleanup re: well well-formedness, BUT requires all your tags to be legit HTML tags. I'm looking for something that does the former, but not the later. (Alan Storm)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run a regex (sorry!) over the tags, and when it finds one which isn't a valid HTML element, replace it with a valid element that you know doesn't exist in any of the documents (&lt;code&gt;blink&lt;/code&gt; comes to mind...), and give it an attribute value with the name of the illegal element, so that you can switch it back afterwards. eg:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$code = str_replace("&amp;lt;pseudo-tag&amp;gt;", "&amp;lt;blink rel=\"pseudo-tag\"&amp;gt;", $code);
// and then back again...
$code = preg_replace('&amp;lt;blink rel="(.*?)"&amp;gt;', '&amp;lt;\1&amp;gt;', $code);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;obviously that code won't work, but you get the general idea?&lt;/p&gt;

i have scenario where i have to provide my own control template for a few WPF controls - i.e. GridViewHeader. when you take a look at control template for GridViewHEader in blend, it is agregated from several other controls, which in some cases are styled for that control only - i.e. this splitter between columns. 
those templates, obviously are resources hidden somewhere in system...dll (or somewhwere in themes dll's). 
so, my question is - is there a way to reference those predefined templates? so far, i've ended up having my own copies of them in my resources, but i don't like that approach :/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;here is sample scenario:
i have a GridViewColumnHeader:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;        &amp;lt;Style TargetType="{x:Type GridViewColumnHeader}" x:Key="gridViewColumnStyle"&amp;gt;

                            &amp;lt;/Trigger&amp;gt;

&lt;p&gt;so far - nothing interesting, but say, i want to add some extra functionality straight in the template - i'd leave cotnent presenter as is, add my controls next to it and i'd like to leave Thumb with defaults from framework. i've found themes provided by microsoft here:&lt;/p&gt;

    &amp;lt;Setter Property="Template"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;Setter.Value&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;ControlTemplate TargetType="{x:Type Thumb}"&amp;gt;

                        Background="Transparent"&amp;gt;
                    &amp;lt;Rectangle HorizontalAlignment="Center"
                               Width="1"

    &amp;lt;/Setter&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/Style&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so far - i have to copy &amp;amp; paste that style, while i'd prefer to get reference to it from resources.&lt;/p&gt;

1. free any memory belonging to members of B&lt;br /&gt;
2. copy the contents of C into B  (this includes its "next" pointer)&lt;br /&gt;
3. delete the entire item C  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you'll have to be careful about edge cases, such as working on lists of one item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now where there was B, you have C and the storage that used to be C is freed.&lt;/p&gt;

Take special note of the cmd-F7 action to lock focus on an element and the Refresh button.  Sadly the element and property names don't directly match those in the script suite, but you can look at the dictionary for System Events or usually guess the right terminology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this you can determine two things.  First, the &lt;code&gt;focused&lt;/code&gt; property isn't on the &lt;code&gt;menu item&lt;/code&gt;, but rather there is a &lt;code&gt;text field&lt;/code&gt; within the &lt;code&gt;menu item&lt;/code&gt; that is focused.  Second, the menu item has a &lt;code&gt;selected&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this, I came up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;tell application "System Events"
    tell (first process whose frontmost is true)
     set helpMenuItem to menu bar item "Help" of menu bar 1

     -- Use reference form to avoid building intermediate object specifiers, which Accessibility apparently isn't good at resolving after the fact.
     set searchBox to a reference to menu item 1 of menu of helpMenuItem
     set searchField to a reference to text field 1 of searchBox

     if searchField's focused is true then
      key code 53 -- type esc
     else
      click helpMenuItem
     end if
    end tell
end tell
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though this still doesn't work.  The key event isn't firing as far as I can tell, so something may still be hinky with the &lt;code&gt;focused&lt;/code&gt; property on the text field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, your &lt;code&gt;click&lt;/code&gt; again solution seems much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

The dom model is good if you can afford to load your entire xml file into memory at once, and you don't mind dealing with data structures, and you are looking at much/most of the model. The sax model is great if you only care about a few tags, and/or you are dealing with big files and can process them sequentially. The xpath model is a little bit of each -- you can pick and choose paths to the data elements you need, but it requires more libraries to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want straightforward and packaged with Python, minidom is your answer, but it's pretty lame, and the documentation is "here's docs on dom, go figure it out". It's really annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

The Just In Time compiler (JIT) would not have an impact on performance of a little application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java 1.6u10 (&lt;a href="http://download.java.net/jdk6/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://download.java.net/jdk6/&lt;/a&gt;) touches the runtime JARs in a background process (even if Java isn't running) to keep the data in the disk cache.  This significantly decreases startup times (Which is a huge benefit to desktop apps, but probably of marginal value to server side apps).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On large, long running applications, the JIT makes a big difference over time - but the amount of time required for the JIT to accumulate sufficient statistics to kick in and optimize (5-10 seconds) is very, very short compared to the overall life of the application (most run for months and months).  While storing and restoring the JIT results is an interesting academic exercise, the practical improvement is not very large (Which is why the JIT team has been more focused on things like GC strategies for minimizing memory cache misses, etc...).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pre-compilation of the runtime classes does help desktop applications quite a bit (as does the aforementioned 6u10 disk cache pre-loading).&lt;/p&gt;

On the other hand, on the rare occasions when I still get to write C#, I'm always amazed by how quickly and succinctly I can get things done.&lt;/p&gt;

(It's right under the System Monitor console which provides us with the above mentioned counters. If it is not there, click "File" &gt; "Add/remove snap-in", click Add and select "Performance Logs and Alerts" in the list".) From the "Performance Logs and Alerts", create a new monitoring configuration under "Counter Logs". Then you can add the counters, specify the sampling rate, the log format (binary or plain text) and log location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are your goals; how do you want to balance profit against enjoyment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you short term oriented or in for the long haul&lt;/li&gt;

If the advice is for more than six to 12 months, the probability the advice is wildly incorrect approaches 1.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can only tell you my story, quickly.  In 2000 I was happy as a consultant working profitably in C++ on Windows applications, writing about ASP.NET and WinForms. then I saw C# and the world turned upside down. I never went back.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years ago I had the same kind of revelation, only an order of magnitude bigger, stronger and with more conviction about Silverlight. Yes, WPF is magnificent, and it may be that I'm all wet about this, but I believe in my gut that Silverlight changes everything.  There was no doubt then and there is no doubt today that Silverlight is the most important development platform for Microsoft since .NET (certainly) and possibly since the switch to C++. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, here is why. I don't understand where its limitations are. With most platforms I do: you can do this, but you can't do that. WPF is a pretty good case in point, as was ASP.Net and WinForms and, well really everything until now.&lt;br&gt;
With Silverlight, I don't see the boundaries yet. Silverlight has already leaped off the desktop onto phones, and I don't see any reason for it to stop there. Yes, it is true, it is bound by the browser, but I see that less as a jail cell than as a tank in which Silverlight will be riding over lots of terrain (it must be very late, I should go to bed). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, for now, learning Silverlight is a gas, there is a lot of material on the &lt;a href="http://www.silverlight.net/"&gt;Silverlight.net site&lt;/a&gt;, and what is the very best thing about learning Silverlight is that if you don't see what you need you can holler at me and I'll make sure you get it pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy, good luck and the dirty little secret is you'll be fine whichever you choose. It's all just software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a code analysis point-of-view, it sees you storing the address of a variable, but that address is never dereferenced and you don't jump outside of the function to external code that could use that address you stored.  When you exit the function, the address of the stack is now considered bogus, since its the address of a variable that no longer exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "volatile" keyword really doesn't do much in C, especially with regards to multiple threads or hardware.  It just tells the compiler that it has to do the access.  However, since there's no users of the value of x according to the data flow, there's no reason to store the "1" on the stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It probably would work if you wrote&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void foo(unsigned int x) {
    volatile int y = x;
    *(volatile unsigned int*)(0x4000000 + 0xd4) = (unsigned int)(&amp;amp;y);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;although it still may be illegal code, since the address of y is considered invalid as soon as foo returns, but the nature of the DMA system would be to reference that location independently of the program flow.&lt;/p&gt;

Spring is always innovating and recognizes real-world constraints. Spring offered simplicity and elegance for the Java 1.4 application servers and didn't require a version of the J2EE specification that no one had access to in 2004 - 2006.  At this point it is almost a religious debate that you can get sucked into - Spring + abstraction + open-source versus Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) 5.0 specifications.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Spring &lt;strong&gt;compliments more than competes&lt;/strong&gt;  with the Java EE specifications. As the features that were once unique to Spring continue to get rolled into the specification, many will argue that EJB 3 offers a 'good enough' feature set for most internal business applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What pitfalls can I expect with each?&lt;/strong&gt;
If your treating this as persistence issue (Spring+JPA) versus EJB3 your really not making that big of a choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where can I find good benchmark information?&lt;/strong&gt;
I haven't followed the &lt;a href="http://www.spec.org/jAppServer2004/results/jAppServer2004.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;specj benchmark results&lt;/a&gt; for sometime, but they were popular for a while.  It seems that each vendor (IBM, JBOSS, Oracle, and Sun) get less and less interested in having a compliant server.  The lists get Shorter and shorter of certified vendors as you go from 1.3, 1.4. 1.5 Java Enterprise Edition.  I think the days of a giant server that is fully compliant with all the specifications are over.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;On initially loading the page the js loads and is executed but on subsequent reloads of the page the js code does not go through the execution process again&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure I understand your problem exactly, since the JS should execute every time, no matter if it's an include, or inline script.  But I'm wondering if your problem somehow relates to browser caching.  There may be two separate points of caching issues:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your javascript include is being cached, and you are attempting to serve dynamically generated or recently edited javascript from this include.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your ajax request is being cached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;zipStream.read(tempBuffer)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if it's returning -1, then the zipStream is closed before you get it, and all bets are off.  It's time to use your debugger and make sure what's being passed to you is actually valid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you call getNextEntry(), does it return a value, and is the data in the entry meaningful (i.e. does getCompressedSize() return a valid value)?  IF you are just reading a Zip file that doesn't have read-ahead zip entries embedded, then ZipInputStream isn't going to work for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some useful tidbits about the Zip format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each file embedded in a zip file has a header.  This header can contain useful information (such as the compressed length of the stream, it's offset in the file, CRC) - or it can contain some magic values that basically say 'The information isn't in the stream header, you have to check the Zip post-amble'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each zip file then has a table that is attached to the end of the file that contains all of the zip entries, along with the real data.  The table at the end is mandatory, and the values in it must be correct.  In contrast, the values embedded in the stream do not have to be provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use ZipFile, it reads the table at the end of the zip.  If you use ZipInputStream, I suspect that getNextEntry() attempts to use the entries embedded in the stream.  If those values aren't specified, then ZipInputStream has no idea how long the stream might be.  The inflate algorithm is self terminating (you actually don't need to know the uncompressed length of the output stream in order to fully recover the output), but it's possible that the Java version of this reader doesn't handle this situation very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will say that it's fairly unusual to have a servlet returning a ZipInputStream (it's much more common to receive an inflatorInputStream if you are going to be receiving compressed content.&lt;/p&gt;

Files and directories that are ignored won't be reported in "svn st" commands and won't go into the repo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: you have C source code in .c and .h files, but the compiler creates a bunch of .o files that you don't want subversion to bother telling you about.  You can use Subversion's properties feature to tell it to ignore these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a few files  in one checked-out working directory, for example myproject/mysource/ &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;bash&gt;  svn propedit svn:ignore  mysource&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the text editor that pops up (in linux, probably vi or whatever your EDITOR env var is set to), add one filename pattern per line.  Do not put a trailing space after the pattern (this confuses svn).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;*.o&lt;br /&gt;
  *.bak  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's all. You may want to do a commit right away, since sometimes svn gets fussy about users making too many different kinds of changes to files between commits.  (my rule is: if in doubt, commit.  It's cheap)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a type of file appearing in many places in a sprawling directory tree, edit the subversion config file kept inside the repository.  This requires the repository administrator's action, unless you have direct access to the repository (not through svn: or http: or file:, but can 'cd' to the repository location and 'ls' its files).  The svn books should have the details; i don't recall offhand right now.&lt;/p&gt;

Now, I am not sure why the current behaviour is not "right" for you, since if you have initialized the List, then it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; initialized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you have three options here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add code to the Getter to return null if the collection has 0 items. This may mess up other code you have though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement the &lt;em&gt;IXmlSerializable&lt;/em&gt; interface and do all the work yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If this is a common process, then you may want to look at my question "&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20084/xml-serialization-and-inherited-types"&gt;XML Serialization and Inherited Types&lt;/a&gt;" - Yes, I know it deals with another issue, but it shows you how to create a generic intermediary serialization class that can then be "bolted on" to allow a serilization process to be encapsulated. You could create a similar class to deal with overriding the default process for null/zero-item collections.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximum server memory (in MB)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Specifies the maximum amount of memory
  SQL Server can allocate when it starts
  and while it runs. This configuration
  option can be set to a specific value
  if you know there are multiple
  applications running at the same time
  as SQL Server and you want to
  guarantee that these applications have
  sufficient memory to run. If these
  other applications, such as Web or
  e-mail servers, request memory only as
  needed, then do not set the option,
  because SQL Server will release memory
  to them as needed. &lt;strong&gt;However,
  applications often use whatever memory
  is available when they start and do
  not request more if needed.&lt;/strong&gt; If an
  application that behaves in this
  manner runs on the same computer at
  the same time as SQL Server, set the
  option to a value that guarantees that
  the memory required by the application
  is not allocated by SQL Server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recommendation on minimum is: No such thing. The more memory the better. The SQL Sever needs as much memory as it can get or it will trash your IO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop the SQL Server. Run your other applications and take note to the amount of memory they need. Subtract that from your total available RAM, and use that number for the MAX memory setting in the SQL Server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are two major approaches to achieve more dynamic style handling:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server-side variables in inline css&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOM manipulation with javascript to change css client-side&lt;br /&gt;
Examples (using jQuery library):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$('.myclass').css('color', 'blue');&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;OR&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;//The jsvarColor could be set with the original page response javascript&lt;br /&gt;
  // in the DOM or retrieved on demand (AJAX) based on user action.
  $('.myclass').css('color', jsvarColor); &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, consider a program that loads a dynamic library (pseudocode):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;lib = loadLibrary("someLibrary");
fun = getFunction("someFunction");
fun();
unloadLibrary(lib);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let's suppose that this library uses your thread:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void someFunction() {
    volatile bool finished_flag = false;
    thrd = new boost::thread(boost::bind(&amp;amp;myclass::mymethod, this, &amp;amp;finished_flag);
    while(!finished_flag) { // ignore the polling loop, it's besides the point
        sleep();
    }
    delete thrd;
}

void myclass::mymethod() {
    // do stuff
    finished_flag = true;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;code&gt;myclass::mymethod()&lt;/code&gt; sets &lt;code&gt;finished_flag&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;myclass::mymethod()&lt;/code&gt; hasn't returned yet. At the very least, it still has to execute a "return" instruction of some sort (if not much more: destructors, exception handler management, etc.). If the thread executing &lt;code&gt;myclass::mymethod()&lt;/code&gt; gets pre-empted before that point, &lt;code&gt;someFunction()&lt;/code&gt; will return to the calling program, and the calling program will unload the library. When the thread executing &lt;code&gt;myclass::mymethod()&lt;/code&gt; gets scheduled to run again, the address containing the "return" instruction is no longer valid, and the program crashes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution would be for &lt;code&gt;someFunction()&lt;/code&gt; to call &lt;code&gt;thrd-&amp;gt;join()&lt;/code&gt; before returning. This would ensure that the thread has returned to the OS and is no longer executing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out pdfTron (google it) and see if it will do what you want. Then you just got to figure out which license you need and how you gonna pay for it. If someone comes up with something better, hope they'll vote it to the top of the list!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are going to write the regex in Perl, please use the "xms" options so that you can leave spaces and document the regex. For example you can write a regex like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; m{\w+ \s+      #return type
   \w+ \s*      #function name
   [(] [^)]* [)] #params
   \s* [{]           #open paren
  }xms
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the options (think x) allows the # comments inside a regex. Also use \s instead of a " ". \s stands for any "blank" character. So tabs would also match -- which is what you would want. In Perl you don't need to use / /, you can use { } or &amp;lt; &gt; or | |.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure if other languages have this ability. If they do, then please use them.&lt;/p&gt;

using statusInd as a bitmask allows me to perform data management (delete, archive, replicate, restore, etc.). Using this in views I can then do the data distribution, publishing, etc for the consuming applications. If performance is a concern regarding views, use small fact tables to support this information, dropping the fact, drops the relation and allows for scalled deletes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scales well and is data centric keeping the data footprint pretty small - key for 350gb+ dbs with realtime concerns.  Using alternatives, tables, triggers has some overhead that depending on the need may or may not work for you.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, the number of combinations is the (number of words) to the power of (number of letters per word). So, choose a random number between 0 and the number of combinations - 1, convert that number to base (number of words), then use each digit of that number as the indicator for which word to take the next letter from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;eg: in the above example. 3 words, 6 letters = 729 combinations. Choose a random number: 465. Convert to base 3: 122020. Take the first letter from word 1, 2nd from word 2, 3rd from word 2, 4th from word 0... and you get... "joofle".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wanted all the permutations, just loop from 0 to 728. Of course, if you're just choosing one random value, a much &lt;strike&gt;simpler&lt;/strike&gt; less-confusing way would be to loop over the letters. This method lets you avoid recursion, should you want all the permutations, plus it makes you look like you know Maths&lt;sup&gt;(tm)&lt;/sup&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the number of combinations is excessive, you can break it up into a series of smaller words and concatenate them at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;code&gt;\bballs?\b&lt;/code&gt; matches &lt;code&gt;ball&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;balls&lt;/code&gt; as a separate word.
  &lt;code&gt;\b&lt;/code&gt; matches at the beginning or end of the buffer regardless of what text appears next to it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just about everything you'll need for some time is there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is how I'd go about getting started, but there are lots of alternative paths as well...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go to the [getting started page][1] but don't download everything you see. Focus on just the big green numbers 1 and 2, that is the links to download Visual Studio 2000, the tools for Beta 2 VS 200, and the Beta 1 pack as well as the Blend 2.5 June 2008 preview. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click on Learn on the menu (or click [here][2] ) and watch on lien or download the first video, the Silverlight install experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming you haven't worked in Silverlight or WPF before, I'd take a look at our [showcase][3] applications, just to get a sense of what can be done with Silverlight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you've done that, the order of videos Ive recommended in the past is in [this blog entry.][4] (which you'll see is where i cribbed these notes from)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the basics are under your belt, be sure to check out our expanding collection of [tutorials][5], [videos][6], [webcasts][7], and we have a lot more on the way, including forthcoming books, and a number of alternatives. Also, tomorrow I start a monthly blog cast with [Sparkling Client][8] which I hope will be fun and informative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, when you have questions, you certainly can ask here (this looks like a tremendous resource!) but if they are Silverlight related you may also want to post them on our [forums][9] &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps.&lt;/p&gt;

The packaging task uses reflection for some reason or another. When it finds that your class inherits from a class in another domain, it tries to load it using reflection. However, reflection doesn't do binding policy, so that domain isn't loaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors of the packaging program could solve this by adding the following code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;AppDomain.CurrentDomain.ReflectionOnlyAssemblyResolve += new ResolveEventHandler(CurrentDomain_ReflectionOnlyAssemblyResolve);
Assembly a = System.Reflection.Assembly.ReflectionOnlyLoadFrom(filename);

static Assembly CurrentDomain_ReflectionOnlyAssemblyResolve(object sender, ResolveEventArgs args)
{
    return System.Reflection.Assembly.ReflectionOnlyLoad(args.Name);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you need a solution for your project, just add the assemblies to the GAC and it will be able to resolve them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an abstract class &lt;code&gt;MyClass&lt;/code&gt;.

This will all the visibility work out, at the cost of having to access &lt;code&gt;MyClass&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;MyClass.MyClass&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;MyClass&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; as given. Make a static class &lt;code&gt;MyClass&lt;/code&gt; which calls the static methods in &lt;code&gt;MyClass&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;MyClass&amp;lt;AnyTypeItDoesntMatter&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (probably using the appropriate type each time, just for giggles).&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I think part of the problem is that there are no specs or User Stories as such. Personally I think they need to be writing down some sort of requirements - what sort of things should they be writing down and to what complexity given its an agile process?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, without having any specs you probably have no acceptance test for the backlog itens as well. You should ask the PO to write the user stories, I like the "As a - type of user -, I want -some goal- so that -some reason-." form. Keep in mind that the User Stories shall be INVEST - &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;ndependent, &lt;strong&gt;N&lt;/strong&gt;egotiable, &lt;strong&gt;V&lt;/strong&gt;aluable to users or customers, &lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;stimable, &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;mall and &lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;estable. What is a must is to have the Acceptance tests written together with the story so that the team should know what the story must be able to do in order do be set as done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that as the product evolves, it's expected to the PO have ideas as he sees the working product. It's not a bad thing, actually it is one of the best thing you can get through Agile. What you have to pay attention is that this ideas mus be included in the product backlog and it needs to be prioritized by th PO. And, if it's necessary and will add value to the customer, the idea should be planned to be built in the next sprint.&lt;/p&gt;

This process can remove intermediate results which are unncessary to complete an expression or function evaluation, but may be of interest to you when debugging.  Similarly, optimizations can alter the apparent control flow so that things may happen in a slightly different order than what appears in the source code.  This is done to skip unnecessary or redundant calculations.  This rejiggering of code can mess with the mapping between source code line numbers and object code addresses making it hard for a debugger to follow the flow of control as you wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debugging in unoptimized mode allows you to see everything you've written as you've written it without the optimizer removing or reordering things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you are happy that your program is working correctly you can turn on optimizations to get improved performance.  Even though optimizers are pretty trustworthy these days, it's still a good idea to build a good quality test suite to ensure that your program runs identically (from a functional point of view, not considering performance) in both optimized and unoptimized mode.&lt;/p&gt;

All I can think of (and I'm not claiming it will be pretty) that will do what you want but retain the composability you need would be something like...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;private static bool TestWith&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(T cached, Func&amp;lt;T, bool&amp;gt; predicate)

    return predicate(cached);

public static Expression&amp;lt;Func&amp;lt;Potion, bool&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
    ContainsIngredients(string ingredientType, params string[] ingredients)
{
    var predicate = PredicateBuilder.False&amp;lt;Potion&amp;gt;();
    // Here, I'm accessing p.Ingredients several times in one 
    // expression.  Is there any way to cache this value and
    // reference the cached value in the expression?
    foreach (var ingredient in ingredients)
    {
        var temp = ingredient;

            p =&amp;gt; TestWith(p.Ingredients,
                i =&amp;gt; i != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp;

}

&lt;p&gt;You could combine together the results from multiple TestWith calls into a more complex boolean expression where required - caching the appropriate expensive value with each call - or you can nest them within the lambdas passed as the second parameter to deal with your complex deep hierarchies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be quite hard to read code though and since you might be introducing a bunch more stack transitions with all the TestWith calls, whether it improves performance would depend on just how expensive your ExpensiveCall() was.&lt;/p&gt;

I am using the type inference scheme described in &lt;a href="http://people.cs.uu.nl/bastiaan/phdthesis/index.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Top Quality Type Error Messages&lt;/a&gt; by Bastiaan Heeren, but I'd assume that the general idea is probably the same in all Hindley-Milner-esque approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like coercion could be treated as a form of overloading, but the overloading approach described in this paper doesn't consider (at least not in a way I could follow) overloading based on requirements that the context places on return type, which is a must for coercions. I'm also concerned that such an approach might make it difficult to give priority to the identity coercion, and also to respect the transitive closure of coercibility. I can see sugaring each coercible expression, say &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;, to coerce(&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;), but sugaring it to coerce(coerce(coerce(... coerce(&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;) ...))) for some depth equal to the maximum nesting of coercions seems silly, and also limits the coercibility relation to something with a finite transitive closure whose depth is independent of the context, which seems (needlessly?) restrictive.&lt;/p&gt;

So even with a 16 minutes latency between  taking the action and seeing the result it can be defined as real-time, because if it takes more than the 16 minutes planned delay, there is a huge risk that the vehicle could collide with a rock or fall into a depression. &lt;/p&gt;

  bool set_foo(std::str);
  ...
}

...

A a = new A();
C c = new C();

...

// wish i knew how to write A's to_str()
c.set_foo(a.to_str());
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should mention that C is fairly stable, but A and B (and the rest of A's dependents) are in a state of flux, so the less code changes necessary the better. The current print(FILE* F) interface also needs to be preserved. I have considered several approaches to implementing A::to_str(), each with advantages and disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change the calls to fprintf() to sprintf()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wouldn't have to rewrite any format strings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;print() could be reimplemented as: fprint(f, this.to_str());&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But I would need to manually allocate char[]s, merge a lot of c strings , and finally convert the character array to a std::string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to catch the results of a.print() in a string stream&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would have to convert all of the format strings to &amp;lt;&amp;lt; output format. There are hundreds of fprintf()s to convert :-{&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;print() would have to be rewritten because there is no standard way that I know of to create an output stream from a UNIX file handle (though &lt;a href="http://synflood.at/blog/index.php?/archives/456-One-word-of-warning-about-stdio_filebuf.html"&gt;this guy says it may be possible&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use Boost's &lt;a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_36_0/libs/format/doc/format.html"&gt;string format library&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More external dependencies. Yuck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Format's syntax is different enough from printf() to be annoying: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;printf(format_str, args) -&gt; cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; boost::format(format_str) % arg1 % arg2 % etc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use Qt's QString::printf()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A different external dependency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looks like QString::printf() is &lt;a href="http://www.potu.com/man/doc.trolltech.com/4.0/qstring.html"&gt;on its way out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, have I exhausted all possible options? If so, which do you think is my best bet? If not, what have I overlooked?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some coding standards (MISRA C) requires that all types used are size specified (i.e. Int32 and not int).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also good to specify prefixes for different type variables (e.g. b for 8 bit byte, w for 16 bit word, and l for 32 bit long word =&gt; Int32 lMyVariable)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should care because it makes your code more portable and more maintainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portable may not be applicable to C# if you are always going to use C# and the C# specification will never change in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintainable ihmo will always be applicable, because the person maintaining your code may not be aware of this particular C# specification, and miss a bug were the int occasionaly becomes more than 2147483647.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a simple for-loop that counts for example the months of the year, you won't care, but when you use the variable in a context where it could possibly owerflow, you should care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also care if you are going to do bit-wise operations on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know the difference between the user and the customer.&lt;/strong&gt;
The business owners that approve the shiny project are usually the customers. However, a devastating mistake is the tendency to confuse them as the user. The customer is usually the person that recognizes the need for your product, but the user is the person that will actually be using the solution (and will most likely complain later about a requirement your product did not meet).
Go to more than one person&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because were all human, and we tend to not remember every excruciating detail. You increase your likelihood of finding missed requirements as you talk to more people and cross-check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid specials&lt;/strong&gt;
When a user asks for something very specific, be wary. Always question the biases and see if this will really make your product better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prototype&lt;/strong&gt;
Dont wait till launch to show what you have to the user. Do frequent prototypes (you can even call them beta versions) and get constant feedback throughout the development process. Youll probably find more requirements as you do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a slight idea, and if my idea is right then this answer should suffice as my answer. I believe you're talking about this from the perspective of someone who's creating a language, in which case you can look at a language like ActionScript 3 for an example. In AS3 you can typecast two different ways: 1) &lt;em&gt;NewType(object)&lt;/em&gt;, or 2) &lt;em&gt;object as NewType&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an implementation standpoint I imaging every class should define it's own ways of converting to whichever types it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; convert to (an Array can't really convert to an integer...or can it?). For example, if you try &lt;em&gt;Integer(myArrayObject)&lt;/em&gt;, and myArrayObject does not define a way of converting to and Integer, you can either throw an exception or let it be and simply pass in the original object, uncasted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My entire answer could be totally off though :-D Let me know if this isn't what you're looking for&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, here are some high level principles that I follow to make sure I build the right product with a delightful experience: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know the difference between the user and the customer.&lt;/strong&gt;
The business owners that approve the shiny project are usually the customers. However, a devastating mistake is the tendency to confuse them as the user. The customer is usually the person that recognizes the need for your product, but the user is the person that will actually be using the solution (and will most likely complain later about a requirement your product did not meet).
Go to more than one person&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because were all human, and we tend to not remember every excruciating detail. You increase your likelihood of finding missed requirements as you talk to more people and cross-check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid specials&lt;/strong&gt;
When a user asks for something very specific, be wary. Always question the biases and see if this will really make your product better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prototype&lt;/strong&gt;
Dont wait till launch to show what you have to the user. Do frequent prototypes (you can even call them beta versions) and get constant feedback throughout the development process. Youll probably find more requirements as you do this.&lt;/p&gt;

At some point, the free-form nature of the formats starts to cause a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, I have the same conceptual data split up between two documents. This is done because both provide useful views of the data. (Note that this is meant to strictly manage feature descriptions written by "management" and then correlated with tasks created by "development")&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document (Basically the functional specification)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contains high level descriptions of releases and features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is written in user-speak but created by management/marketing/producers/customer proxy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Useful for a quick glance or detailed read through of the features in a release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is "user" facing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spreadsheet (Basically the engineering schedule)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contains line item descriptions of feature tasks, estimates, and resource assignments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is developer facing &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated collaboratively by developers as they work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Useful for a detailed view of the effort required (and spent) for features in a release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we want to reprioritize features, or add/remove ones, and that happens in the document. That restructuring then needs to be duplicated in the spreadsheet. This is a pain in the ass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My ideal solution would
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easily support batch rearrangement of arbitrary groups of items (like a spreadsheet does).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be completely usable without touching a mouse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be able to switch back and forth from a narrative outline view to a detailed line item view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have different data visible in each view, but have the data travel with the items if they move.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support basic rich-text formatting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support simultaneous-ish editing by multiple users (Ala google apps, zoho, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Absolutely no support for diagramming. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven't yet read the paper you link to but it sounds interesting.  Have you looked at all how ad-hoc polymorphism (basically overloading) works in Haskell?  Haskell's type system is H-M plus some other goodies.  One of those goodies is type classes.  Type classes provide overloading, or as Haskeller's call it, ad-hoc polymorphism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In GHC, the most widely used Haskell compiler, the type classes are implemented by passing dictionaries at run-time.  The dictionary lets the run-time system do a lookup from type to implementation.  Supposedly, &lt;a href="http://repetae.net/computer/jhc/" rel="nofollow"&gt;jhc&lt;/a&gt; can use super-optimization to pick the right implementation at compile time but I'm skeptical it handles the fully polymorphic cases that Haskell can allow and I know of no formal proofs or papers asserting the correctness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds like your type inference will run into the same problems as other rank-n polymorphic approaches.  You may well want to read some of the papers here for additional background: &lt;a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Scroll down to "Papers about types"&lt;/a&gt;  His papers are haskell specific but the type theoretic stuff should be meaningful and useful to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this paper about rank-n polymorphism and the type checking issues should spark some interesting thoughts for you: &lt;a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/higher-rank/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/higher-rank/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If, for example, you implement a generic &lt;code&gt;Stack&amp;lt;E&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, you could provide a method to push a number of elements to the stack like so: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public void pushAll(Iterable&amp;lt;? extends E&amp;gt; elements) {

Its multi-user, and has a lot of functionality built in. It can also generate higher-level views, but I would not consider them customer/marketing views. Those are best hand tuned and edited in my opinion. EA is sometimes compared to Rational Rose without the suck, which is a fairly good description.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If formality and extensive modeling is not your strong suit (its not mine), even a simple Bugzilla instance (or other issue-tracker) can be used. Bugzilla does time tracking, priorities, can be smashed into doing resource planning, etc. Other options here are Trac or Redmine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another popular tool for the diagram-happy crowd is Microsoft Project. It does suffer from the multi-user usability problem though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that all of these are "developer" tools, not customer/user tools. As I said above, you should really produce this by hand. When you do a release (even interim releases), spend a couple of hours looking through your developer-side tool on completed tasks and transform them into something customer or higher-up ready. If you can't devote the time at the end, create 'large' tasks and mark tasks as dependent on these higher level ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll need to create a key under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT with the name set to your file extension (eg: ".txt"). Set the default value of this key to a unique name for your file type, such as "Acme.TextFile". Then create another key under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT with the name set to "Acme.TextFile". Add a subkey called "DefaultIcon" and set the default value of the key to the file containing the icon you wish to use for this file type. Add another sibling called "shell". Under the "shell" key, add a key for each action you wish to have available via the Explorer context menu, setting the default value for each key to the path to your executable followed by a space and "%1" to represent the path to the file selected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, here's a sample registry file to create an association between .txt files and EmEditor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.txt]
@="emeditor.txt"

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\emeditor.txt]
@="Text Document"

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\emeditor.txt\DefaultIcon]
@="%SystemRoot%\\SysWow64\\imageres.dll,-102"

Addons are patches, and custom code modifies core. (Unless things have drastically changed since I last looked at it - judging by the version numbers, they have not). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While probably at a bit higher level than you seem to be asking, Drupal is a very attractive platform. It is a CMS at its base, and using &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/project/ecommerce" rel="nofollow"&gt;ecommerce&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.ubercart.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ubercart&lt;/a&gt; you can turn it into a store. With modules like &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/project/cck" rel="nofollow"&gt;CCK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/project/views" rel="nofollow"&gt;Views&lt;/a&gt; you can build very sophisticated ecommerce sites (specialized product types, attributes) with very little coding, plus you get all the CMS tools (editing, access control, etc) for free. If you write your own modules, you can hook into almost anything in Drupal without touching the core code, and you get a ton of flexibility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though a lot of developers may not consider it simply because they're stuck in this view that they should write something from scratch, Drupal is a really great development platform for this sort of thing. There is definitely a learning curve to it, especially when you need to write modules for it, but the time it takes to learn and implement a site is still probably less than writing a very customized ecommerce site from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I understand... it is pretty much the LD_PRELOAD trick or a kernel module.  There's not a whole lot of middle ground unless you want to run it under an emulator which can trap out to your function or do code re-writing on the actual binary to trap out to your function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming you can't modify the program and can't (or don't want to) modify the kernel, the LD_PRELOAD approach is the best one, assuming your application is fairly standard and isn't actually one that's maliciously trying to get past your interception.  (In which case you will need one of the other techniques.)&lt;/p&gt;

With this scheme, you can process lots of requests with just a few threads.&lt;/p&gt;

        // telling us how much was needed.

        if (needed &amp;lt;= (int)size &amp;amp;&amp;amp; needed &amp;gt;= 0) {
            // It fit fine so we're done.

&lt;p&gt;I think what you need to do is either set it up to build with a makefile (probably easiest) or to write a wrapper program that converts VC arguments to gcc ones.

While it is certainly possible to do that (so long as you are careful to check regularly that you haven't broken something expected by the other dev. or design tool), many members of the developer community, including some inside Microsoft, have discovered benefits in keeping Blend and Visual Studio project activity SEPARATE -- even to the point of manually cutting and pasting carefully-refactored versions of Blend-generated Xaml into the "official" VStudio project source, rather than allowing designers and developers operate directly on a single shared code base. Microsoft's User Experience Team in the UK published a video describing the problems they ran into trying to coordinate designer and developer efforts on actual projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main lessons learned is that you can't staff a project with designers and developers who are completely ignorant of each other's domains.  Developers need to be familiar enough with Blend that they can provide designers with useful UI shells for the designer to decorate, and useful data "stubs" the designer can design interactivity against, and the designer needs to have enough understanding of development issues that they don't do things like delete controls and replace them with custom visual elements - not realizing that they broke all the functionality tied to the original control.&lt;/p&gt;

Then you would need to add an offset to the indexes to reflect its position in the integer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i.e. Suppose you started with the MSB of a 32 bit int. The upper nibble indexes I will call upper_idxs, and the lower nibble indexes I will call lower_idxs. Then you need to add 24 to each element of lower_idxs, and add 28 to each element of upper_idxs. The next byte would be similarly processed, except the offsets would be 16 and 20 respectively, since that byte is 8 bits "down".&lt;/p&gt;

I've been in few projects where we've used wikis which have had integrated task management like &lt;a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;trac&lt;/a&gt; and then there has been a larger scale software called &lt;a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/" rel="nofollow"&gt;JIRA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trac is open source and I've seen it use in fairly big open source projects. The wiki is brilliant for documentation because of the collabaritive nature of wikis and task management is really nice for features as well as bug tracking. You can assign tasks and developers can give them estimates. I don't really know what kind of reporting you can get out of Trac but at least there are some things already available &lt;a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracReports" rel="nofollow"&gt;Trac Reports&lt;/a&gt;. I've been using Trac mainly from the developer and project oversight perspective but I think it could be adapted to also management. I can recommend at least looking into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had only developer experience from JIRA, but just because the thing has been used in large scale systems I suppose it must have fairly good reporting facilities. At least it draws diagrams and we know how the management likes them. ;) It doesn't have wiki feature, but I've been using &lt;a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Confluence&lt;/a&gt; with it. They're both from the &lt;a href="http://www.atlassian.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Atlassian&lt;/a&gt; so they can be integrated together at some fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are tools I've had really good experience with. Wiki kind of enviroments are fairly widely used and you can really modify them for your own use. Task management is really pain in the ass if you have to do all the modifications manually. With proper tools and reporting facilities you get better view of the progress of your project.&lt;/p&gt;

We basically used AspectJ to hook up the transference of data from the UI components to the model objects. These model objects were dumb POJOs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actual business logic was done by 'watching' the model objects with AspectJ and firing off the required event if they changed. So if you changed a value in a textbox AspectJ would fire and copy that value into a POJO. If that field in the POJO had an event on it for business logic that would &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; fire. If that logic modified any POJOs (and it could) AspectJ would notice and copy the value from the POJO into the UI component.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;thetalkingwalnut asks:&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are some good ways to convince the skeptical developers on the team of the value of Unit Testing?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone here is going to pile on lots of reasons out of the blue why unit testing is good. However, I find that often the best way to convince someone of something is to &lt;em&gt;listen&lt;/em&gt; to their argument and address it point by point. If you listen and help them verbalize their concerns, you can address each one and perhaps convert them to your point of view (or at the very least, leave them without a leg to stand on). &lt;em&gt;Who knows? Perhaps they will convince you why unit tests aren't appropriate for your situation.&lt;/em&gt; Not likely, but possible.  Perhaps if you post their arguments against unit tests, we can help identify the counterarguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important to listen to and understand both sides of the argument. If you try to adopt unit tests too zealously without regard to people's concerns, you'll end up with a religious war (and probably really worthless unit tests). If you adopt it slowly and start by applying it where you will see the most benefit for the least cost, you might be able to demonstrate the value of unit tests and have a better chance of convincing people. I realize this isn't as easy as it sounds - it usually requires some time and careful metrics to craft a convincing argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unit tests are a tool, like any other, and should be applied in such a way that the benefits (catching bugs) outweigh the costs (the effort writing them). Don't use them if/where they don't make sense and remember that they are only part of your arsenal of tools (e.g. inspections, assertions, code analyzers, formal methods, etc). What I tell my developers is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can skip writing a test for a method if they have a good argument why it isn't necessary (e.g. too simple to be worth it or too difficult to be worth it) and how the method will be otherwise verified (e.g. inspection, assertions, formal methods, interactive/integration tests). They need to consider that some verifications like inspections and formal proofs are done at a point in time and then need to be repeated every time the production code changes, whereas unit tests and assertions can be used as regression tests (written once and executed repeatedly thereafter).  Sometimes I agree with them, but more often I will debate about whether a method is really too simple or too difficult to unit test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a developer argues that a method seems too simple to fail, isn't it worth taking the 60 seconds necessary to write up a simple 5-line unit test for it? These 5 lines of code will run every night (you do nightly builds, right?) for the next year or more and will be worth the effort if even just once it happens to catch a problem that may have taken 15 minutes or longer to identify and debug. Besides, writing the easy unit tests drives up the count of unit tests, which makes the developer look good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if a developer argues that a method seems too difficult to unit test (not worth the significant effort required), perhaps that is a good indication that the method needs to be divided up or refactored to test the easy parts. Usually, these are methods that rely on unusual resources like singletons, the current time, or external resources like a database result set. These methods usually need to be refactored into a method that gets the resource (e.g. calls getTime()) and a method that takes the resource as a argument (e.g. takes the timestamp as a parameter). I let them skip testing the method that retrieves the resource and they instead write a unit test for the method that now takes the resource as a argument. Usually, this makes writing the unit test much simpler and therefore worthwhile to write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The developer needs to draw a "line in the sand" in how comprehensive their unit tests should be. Later in development, whenever we find a bug, they should determine if more comprehensive unit tests would have caught the problem. If so and if such bugs crop up repeatedly, they need to move the "line" toward writing more comprehensive unit tests in the future (starting with adding or expanding the unit test for the current bug). They need to find the right balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its important to realize the unit tests are not a silver bullet and there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; such a thing as too much unit testing. At my workplace, whenever we do a lessons learned, I inevitably hear "we need to write more unit tests". Management nods in agreement because its been banged into their heads that "unit tests" == "good".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we need to understand the impact of "more unit tests". A developer can only write ~N lines of code a week and you need to figure out what percentage of that code should be unit test code vs production code. A lax workplace might have 10% of the code as unit tests and 90% of the code as production code, resulting in product with a lot of (albeit very buggy) features (think MS Word). On the other hand, a strict shop with 90% unit tests and 10% production code will have a rock solid product with very few features (think "vi"). You may never hear reports about the latter product crashing, but that likely has as much to do with the product not selling very well as much as it has to do with the quality of the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse yet, perhaps the only certainty in software development is that "change is inevitable". Assume the strict shop (90% unit tests/10% production code) creates a product that has exactly 2 features (assuming 5% of production code == 1 feature). If the customer comes along and changes 1 of the features, then that change trashes 50% of the code (45% of unit tests and 5% of the production code). The lax shop (10% unit tests/90% production code) has a product with 18 features, none of which work very well. Their customer completely revamps the requirements for 4 of their features. Even though the change is 4 times as large, only half as much of the code base gets trashed (~25% = ~4.4% unit tests + 20% of production code).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point is that you have to communicate that you understand that balance between too little and too much unit testing - essentially that you've thought through both sides of the issue. If you can convince your peers and/or your management of that, you gain credibility and perhaps have a better chance of winning them over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;"Will" anounces the future, or at least how you intend it to be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Shall" dictates what must be done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why specifications use "shall", while new year good resolutions and horoscopes use "will".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it's not, how would you do it with POST? Just out of curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also consider isolating the system and running the &lt;strong&gt;SQL Profiler which will show you all the SQL action on the tables&lt;/strong&gt;. This is often a &lt;strong&gt;good starting point for building a sequence diagram or however you choose to document these codes&lt;/strong&gt;. Good luck!  &lt;/p&gt;

  <row Id="69981" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="57747" CreationDate="2008-09-16T07:08:04.953" Score="19" Body="&lt;p&gt;Your first step should be to download the latest TFS Installation Guide (TFSInstall.chm) from here: &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=FF12844F-398C-4FE9-8B0D-9E84181D9923&amp;amp;displaylang=en"&gt;http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=FF12844F-398C-4FE9-8B0D-9E84181D9923&amp;amp;displaylang=en&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should use TFS 2008 SP1, since it is the latest release and includes many new features and performance improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are planning on installing with Windows 2008 &amp;amp; SQL 2008, you will need to "integrate" the TFS 2008 SP1 into the installation disc. Instructions are included in the TFSInstall.chm, but Martin Woodward also has a walkthrough on his blog:
&lt;a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/vsts/creating_a_tfs.html"&gt;http://www.woodwardweb.com/vsts/creating_a_tfs.html&lt;/a&gt;
(This isn't required for SQL 2005 SP2 + Windows 2003)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The install guide also has hardware recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a team of your size, you should also consider running your TFS instance as a Virtual Machine. This will allow you to up-size and move your installation around more easily at a later date. TFS is supported on the Hyper-V virtualization platform: &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/granth/archive/2008/06/27/team-foundation-server-and-hyper-v-virtualization.aspx"&gt;http://blogs.msdn.com/granth/archive/2008/06/27/team-foundation-server-and-hyper-v-virtualization.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you need help along the way, you have three options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Call up MS product support ($$, but you will get an answer)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
