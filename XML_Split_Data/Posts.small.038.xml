&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that the only serious way of doing this would be to use conditional compilation on each of the derived classes.  Within the #ifdef block, define a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; constant which contains the class name which is being compiled.  Then, the names are still hard coded, but all in a central location.&lt;/p&gt;

If you mean the size of the &lt;code&gt;.jar&lt;/code&gt; files in a Jena deployment, you may be able to leave some of them out: &lt;code&gt;icu4j.jar&lt;/code&gt;, for example, is only used if your app handles internationalized data. However, if you are running a web-service, the deployment size probably doesn't matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if your focus is on performance, it would help if you could post some numbers and/or code snippets. There are some common pitfalls to avoid (such as not using the default &lt;code&gt;OntModel&lt;/code&gt; if you have no need of inferencing). Some of the newer persistent store adapters, such as &lt;a href="http://jena.hpl.hp.com/wiki/TDB" rel="nofollow" title="TDB"&gt;TDB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://jena.hpl.hp.com/wiki/SDB" rel="nofollow" title="SDB"&gt;SDB&lt;/a&gt;, may give significant speed-ups with larger volumes of data. Be aware though, that some of Jena's performance penalty comes from following W3C specs quite closely. Being lightweight at the expense of full compliance may impact your app in unexpected ways in the future, especially if you plan interoperation with other data services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess the other interpretation of lightweight would be the programming model. I think it's fair to say that Jena pays a tax in following closely the RDF-triples view of the world. It's a bit like programming in assembler if what you really want is a high-level language. Jena's ontology API may help you, or you may prefer an OWL-centric API like &lt;a href="http://jena.hpl.hp.com/wiki/SDB" rel="nofollow" title="SDB"&gt;http://owlapi.sourceforge.net/&lt;/a&gt;. Again, if you can post some specific examples of what you're trying to achieve we can give more tailored advice. The next version of Jena will support Java generics, which will definitely help smooth the API, but there's no scheduled release date for that yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One downside in the Active Record model is that it pretty much presumes a single persistence model, barring some particularly intrusive code (in most languages).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The repository interface is defined in the domain layer, but doesn't know whether your data is stored in a database or not. With the repository pattern, I can create an InMemoryRepository so that I can test domain logic in isolation, and use dependency injection in the application to have the service layer instantiate a SqlRepository, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To many people, having a special repository just for testing sounds goofy, but if you use the repository model, you may find that you don't really need a database for your particular application; sometimes a simple FileRepository will do the trick. Wedding to yourself to a database before you know you need it is potentially limiting. Even if a database is necessary, it's a lot faster to run tests against an InMemoryRepository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't have much in the way of domain logic, you probably don't need DDD. ActiveRecord is quite suitable for a lot of problems, especially if you have mostly data and just a little bit of logic.&lt;/p&gt;

I build the control as a specialization of (read: derived from) TextBox control, and using input control and a regular expresin for the validation. 
Adding range validation is terribly easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the code for building the regex. _numericSeparation is a string with characters accepted as decimal comma values
(for example, a '.' or a ',': $10.50 10,50&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;private string ComputeRegexPattern()
{
   StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
   if (this._forcePositives)
   {
       builder.Append("([+]|[-])?");
   }
   builder.Append(@"[\d]*((");
   if (!this._useIntegers)
   {
       for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; this._numericSeparator.Length; i++)
       {
           builder.Append("[").Append(this._numericSeparator[i]).Append("]");
           if ((this._numericSeparator.Length &amp;gt; 0) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (i != (this._numericSeparator.Length - 1)))
           {
               builder.Append("|");
           }
       }
   }
   builder.Append(@")[\d]*)?");
   return builder.ToString();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regular expression matches any number (i.e. any string with numeric characters) with only one character as a numeric separation, and a '+' or a '-' optional character at the beginning of the string.
Once you create the regex (when instanciating the Control), you check if the value is correct overriding the OnValidating method. 
CheckValidNumber() just applies the Regex to the introduced text. If the regex match fails, activates an error provider with an specified error (set with ValidationError public property) and raises a ValidationError event.
Here you could do the verification to know if the number is in the requiered range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;private bool CheckValidNumber()
{
   if (Regex.Match(this.Text, this.RegexPattern).Value != this.Text)
   {
       this._errorProvider.SetError(this, this.ValidationError);
       return false;
   }
   this._errorProvider.Clear();
   return true;
}

protected override void OnValidating(CancelEventArgs e)
{
   bool flag = this.CheckValidNumber();
   if (!flag)
   {
      e.Cancel = true;
      this.Text = "0";
   }
   base.OnValidating(e);
   if (!flag)
   {
      this.ValidationFail(this, EventArgs.Empty);
   }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said, i also prevent the user from input data in the text box other than numeric characteres overriding the OnKeyPress methdod:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;protected override void OnKeyPress(KeyPressEventArgs e)
{
    if ((!char.IsDigit(e.KeyChar) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !char.IsControl(e.KeyChar)) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (!this._numberSymbols.Contains(e.KeyChar.ToString()) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !this._numericSeparator.Contains(e.KeyChar.ToString())))
    {
        e.Handled = true;
    }
    if (this._numberSymbols.Contains(e.KeyChar.ToString()) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !this._forcePositives)
    {
        e.Handled = true;
    }
    if (this._numericSeparator.Contains(e.KeyChar.ToString()) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; this._useIntegers)
    {
        e.Handled = true;
    }
    base.OnKeyPress(e);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The elegant touch: I check if the number valid every time the user releases a key, so the user can get feedback as he/she types. (But remember that you must be carefull with the ValidationFail event ;))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;protected override void OnKeyUp(KeyEventArgs e)
{
    this.CheckValidNumber();
    base.OnKeyUp(e);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

  Console.Write("{0,2}: ", x);

  Console.Write("This is foreground color {0}.", colorNames[x]);
  Console.ResetColor();
  Console.WriteLine();
}

&lt;p&gt;True, but I don't think understanding the build process of a large project is orthogonal to understanding the project itself.  My last job I worked at, they had a huge project that needed to build for the target platform (LynxOS) as well as an emulation environment (WinXP).  They chose to throw everything into one .VCP file for on windows, and build it as one big executable.  On target it was about 50 individual processes, so they wrote a makefile that listed all 3000 source files, compiled them all into one big library, and then linked the individual main.cpp's for each executable with the all-in-one library, to make 50 executables (which shared maybe 10% of their code with the other executables).  As a result, no developer had a clue about what code depended on any other code.  As a result, they never bothered trying to define clean interfaces between anything, because everything was easily accessible from &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;.  A hierarchical build system could have helped enforce some sort of order in an otherwise disorganized source code repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't learn how .cpp files produce object code, what a static library is, what a shared library is, etc., when you are learning C/C++, you do still need to learn it at some point to be a competent C/C++ developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function try block feature was designed specifically to support failures in constructor memberwise initialization (though it may be used for regular functions also). It's the only way to modify or enrich the exception information which will be thrown. But because of its original design purpose (use in constructors) it doesn't permit the exception to be swallowed by an empty catch() clause.&lt;/p&gt;

That said, there are many functions in Win32 for doing such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to change the color of the Win32 console is through the system command in iostream.h. This function invokes a DOS command. To change colors, we will use it to invoke the color command. For example, &lt;code&gt;system("Color F1");&lt;/code&gt; will make the console darkblue on white.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DOS Colors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The colors available for use with the command are the sixteen DOS colors each represented with a hex digit. The first being the background and the second being the foreground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;0 = Black    8 = Gray
1 = Blue     9 = Light Blue

5 = Purple   D = Light Purple
6 = Yellow   E = Light Yellow
7 = White    F = Bright White

&lt;p&gt;Just this little touch of color makes console programs more visually pleasing. However, the Color command will change the color of the entire console. To control individual cells, we need to use functions from windows.h.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is many things, but you could say it's sort of a philosophical take on what it means to "grok" something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commentry from &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/9119/garth-gilmour"&gt;Garth Gilmore&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I credit this book with teaching me more about software development than any programming book I ever read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central thread in the book is how our romantic (artistic) and classical (technical/rational) perceptions of the world are both derived from how we perceive quality in the environment around us. This understanding is then applied to apparently mundane tasks like motorcycle maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give some examples of how this applies to coding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The section on how to approach the motorcycle with a 'quality mindset' that leads to progress is just as applicable to reaching 'the zone' in programming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The section on 'gumption traps' that prevent progress and lead to you damaging the machine is priceless. The solutions that are presented work just as well when trying to modify legacy code without introducing bugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The section on how a purely classical description of an engine part is useless (because it lacks any place for the user to stand) should be read by anyone involved in requirements analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short its a good read :-)&lt;/p&gt;

Session storage is great for data that is specific to a single user.  If you find the default file-based session storage handler is inefficient you can implement something else, possibly using a database or memcache type of backend.  See &lt;a href="http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.session-set-save-handler.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;session_set_save_handler&lt;/a&gt; for more info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it is a bad practice to store common data in a user's session.  There are better places to store data that will be frequently accessed by several users and by storing this data in the session you will be duplicating the data for each user who needs this data.  In your example, you might set up a different type of storage engine for this wave data (based on wave_id) that is NOT tied specifically to a user's session.  That way you'll pull the data down once and them store it somewhere that several users can access the data without requiring another pull.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's possible for someone to hijack a session, so if you're going to use it to keep track of user authorization, be careful. Read &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking" rel="nofollow"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be a very lazy way to keep data. Don't just throw everything in the session so that you don't have to query for it later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're going to store objects in the session, either their class files will need to be included before the session is started on the next request or you'll need to have configured an auto loader.&lt;/li&gt;

It is designed for high-performance applications on very large data sizes, where speed matters a lot. It takes advantage of multiple CPUs and disks to dump your data much faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forget Garbage Collection&lt;/strong&gt; (Use RAII instead). Note that even the Garbage Collector can leak, too (if you forget to "null" some references in Java/C#), and that Garbage Collector won't help you to dispose of resources (if you have an object which acquired a handle to a file, the file won't be freed automatically when the object will go out of scope if you don't do it manually in Java, or use the "dispose" pattern in C#).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forget the "one return per function" rule&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a good C advice to avoid leaks, but it is outdated in C++ because of its use of exceptions (use RAII instead).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And while &lt;strong&gt;the "Sandwich Pattern"&lt;/strong&gt; is a good C advice, it &lt;strong&gt;is outdated in C++&lt;/strong&gt;  because of its use of exceptions (use RAII instead).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post seem to be repetitive, but in C++, the most basic pattern to know is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAII"&gt;RAII&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn to use smart pointers, both from boost, TR1 or even the lowly (but often efficient enough) auto_ptr (but you must know its limitations).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RAII is the basis of both exception safety and resource disposal in C++, and no other pattern (sandwich, etc.) will give you both (and most of the time, it will give you none).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See below a comparison of RAII and non RAII code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void doSandwich()
{
   T * p = new T() ;
   // do something with p
   delete p ; // leak if the p processing throws or return
}

void doRAIIDynamic()
{
   std::auto_ptr&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; p(new T()) ; // you can use other smart pointers, too
   // do something with p
   // WON'T EVER LEAK, even in case of exceptions, returns, breaks, etc.
}

void doRAIIStatic()
{
   T p ;
   // do something with p
   // WON'T EVER LEAK, even in case of exceptions, returns, breaks, etc.
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAII"&gt;RAII&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize (after the comment from &lt;i&gt;Ogre Psalm33&lt;/i&gt;), RAII relies on three concepts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Once the object is constructed, it just works!&lt;/b&gt; Do acquire resources in the constructor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Object destruction is enough!&lt;/b&gt; Do free resources in the destructor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;It's all about scopes!&lt;/b&gt; Scoped objects (see doRAIIStatic example above) will be constructed at their declaration, and will be destroyed the moment the execution exits the scope, no matter how the exit (return, break, exception, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that in correct C++ code, most objects won't be constructed with &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;, and will be declared on the stack instead. And for those constructed using &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;, all will be somehow &lt;i&gt;scoped&lt;/i&gt; (e.g. attached to a smart pointer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a developer, this is very powerful indeed as you won't need to care about manual resource handling (as done in C, or for some objects in Java which makes intensive use of &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; for that case)...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Edit (2012-02-12)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"scoped objects ... will be destructed ... no matter the exit" that's not entirely true. there are ways to cheat RAII. any flavour of terminate() will bypass cleanup. exit(EXIT_SUCCESS) is an oxymoron in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/456/wilhelmtell"&gt;wilhelmtell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/456/wilhelmtell"&gt;wilhelmtell&lt;/a&gt; is quite right about that: There are &lt;em&gt;exceptional&lt;/em&gt; ways to cheat RAII, all leading to the process abrupt stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are &lt;strong&gt;exceptional&lt;/strong&gt; ways because C++ code is not littered with terminate, exit, etc., or in the case with exceptions, we do want an &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1104136/c-raii-not-working"&gt;unhandled exception&lt;/a&gt; to crash the process and core dump its memory image as is, and not after cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we must still know about those cases because, while they rarely happen, they can still happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(who calls &lt;code&gt;terminate&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;exit&lt;/code&gt; in casual C++ code?... I remember having to deal with that problem when playing with &lt;a href="http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/"&gt;GLUT&lt;/a&gt;: This library is very C-oriented, going as far as actively designing it to make things difficult for C++ developers like not caring about &lt;a href="http://www.opengl.org/resources/faq/technical/glut.htm#glot0070"&gt;stack allocated data&lt;/a&gt;, or having "interesting" decisions about &lt;a href="http://www.opengl.org/resources/faq/technical/glut.htm#glot0090"&gt;never returning from their main loop&lt;/a&gt;... I won't comment about that)&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

They're also reasonably secure, as the PHP devs have worked hard to prevent Session Hijacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only issue is that you need to remember to rebuild the session entry when something changes. And, if anything is changed by a user other than the one who owns the session that would result in a need to refresh this key, there is no easy way to notify the system to refresh this session key.  Possibly not a big deal, but something you should be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, if UserDetails.aspx is used to edit and save a users information, if someone with inappropriate permissions enter the page, I would like to render it as read-only.  So, most controls would be converted to labels, loaded with the corresponding data from the editable original control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it would likely be a fairly simple routine, ie:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Dim ctlParent As Control = Me.txtTest.Parent  
Dim ctlOLD As TextBox = Me.txtTest  
Dim ctlNEW As Label = New Label

ctlNEW.Text = ctlOLD.Text  
ctlParent.Controls.Remove(ctlOLD)  
ctlParent.Controls.Add(ctlNEW)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...is really all you need for a textbox --&gt; label conversion, but I was hoping someone might know of an existing function out there as there are likely a few pitfalls here and there with certain controls and situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;
- Just setting the ReadOnly property to true is not a viable solution, as it looks dumb having things greyed out like that.
- Avoiding manually creating a secondary view is the entire point of this, so using an ingenious way to display a read only version of the user interface that was built by hand using labels is wat I am trying to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

in the path to msvsmon.exe to
prevent having to quote the path
(since the whole command needs to be

"binpath=" (and no space before the
'=' character).  Whoever wrote the
command line parser for the sc
command should be cursed.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you can use the services.msc control panel applet to get it running with the right credentials.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What do folks here see as the relative strengths and weaknesses of Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very open question, bordering on flamebait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git is fastest, but all three are fast enough. Bazaar is the most flexible (it has transparent read-write support for SVN repositories) and cares a lot about the user experience. Mercurial is somewhere in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three systems have lots of fanboys. I am personally a Bazaar fanboy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In considering each of them with one another and against version control systems like SVN and Perforce, what issues should be considered?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former are distributed systems. The latter are centralized systems. In addition, Perforce is proprietary while all the others are free &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;as in speech&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Centralized versus decentralized is a much more momentous choice than any of the systems you mentioned within its category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In planning a migration from SVN to one of these distributed version control systems, what factors would you consider?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, lack of a good substitute for TortoiseSVN. Although Bazaar is working on their own &lt;a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/TortoiseBzr" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tortoise variant&lt;/a&gt;, but it's not there yet, as of September 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, training the key people about how using a decentralized system is going to affect their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, integration with the rest of the system, such as issue trackers, the nightly build system, the automated test system, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, aim to send your mails as a 2-part multipart mime message. An HTML part AND a plain-text part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, try to avoid using CSS or positioned divs where possible. Use table-based layouts and inlined-styles. Preferably specifying as much of the style in HTML where possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly this support Microsoft article was beneficial:
&lt;a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;316431" rel="nofollow"&gt;Internet Explorer is unable to open Office documents from an SSL Web site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In order for Internet Explorer to open documents in Office (or any out-of-process, ActiveX document server), Internet Explorer must save the file to the local cache directory and ask the associated application to load the file by using IPersistFile::Load. If the file is not stored to disk, this operation fails.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When Internet Explorer communicates with a secure Web site through SSL, Internet Explorer enforces any no-cache request. If the header or headers are present, Internet Explorer does not cache the file. Consequently, Office cannot open the file.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, something earlier in the page processing was causing the "no-cache" header to get written.  So Response.ClearHeaders needed to be added, this cleared out the no-cache header, and the output of the page needs to allow caching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly for good measure, also added on Response.End, so that no other processing futher on in the request lifetime attempts to clear the headers I've set and re-add the no-cache header.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourthly, discovered that content expiration had been enabled in IIS.  I've left it enabled at the web site level, but since this one aspx page will serve as a gateway for downloading the files, I disabled it at the download page level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here is the code snippet that works (there are a couple other minor changes which I believe are inconsequential):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;System.IO.FileStream fs = new System.IO.FileStream(Server.MapPath(".") + "\\" + "TestMe.doc", System.IO.FileMode.Open);
long byteNum = fs.Length;
byte[] fileBytes = new byte[byteNum];
fs.Read(fileBytes, 0, (int)byteNum);

Response.ClearContent();
Response.ClearHeaders();
Response.AppendHeader("Content-disposition", "attachment; filename=Testme.doc");
Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.Public);
Response.ContentType = "application/octet-stream";
Response.OutputStream.Write(fileBytes, 0, fileBytes.Length);
Response.Flush();
Response.Close();
fs.Close();
Response.End();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind too, this is just for illustration.  The real production code will include exception handling and likely read the file a chunk at a time (perhaps 10K).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In C++, this copies the value, so the comparison will result not-equal.  In Java, operator= performs reference copy, so 'a' and 'b' are now referring to the same value.  As a result, the comparison will produce 'equal', since the object will compare equal to itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between copies and references only adds to the confusion of operator overloading.  As Sebastian mentioned, Java and C# both have to deal with value and reference equality separately -- operator+ would likely deal with values and objects, but operator= is already implemented to deal with references.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In C++, you should only be dealing with one kind of comparison at a time, so it can be less confusing.  For example, on Complex, operator= and operator== are both working on values -- copying values and comparing values respectively.  &lt;/p&gt;

Where this is the case my experience has been that fresh resources can actually unintentionally slow down the people they are relying on to bring them up to speed and in some cases this can be your key people (incidentally it's usually 'key' people that would take the time to educate a newb). When they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; up to speed, there are no guarantees that their work will fit into established 'rules' or 'work culture' with the rest of the team. So again, it can do more harm than good. So that aside, these are the circumstances where it might be beneficial:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) The new resource has a tight task which requires a minimum of interaction with other developers and a skill set that's already been demonstrated. (ie. porting existing code to a new platform, externally refactoring a dead module that's currently locked down in the existing code base).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) The project is managed in such a way that other more senior team members time can be shared to assist bringing the newb up to speed and mentoring them along the way to ensure their work is compatible with what's already been done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) The other team members are very patient. &lt;/p&gt;

Basically, Sessions are a great place to store user-specific data that you need to access across several page loads.  Sessions are NOT a great place to store database connection references; you'd be better to use some sort of connection pooling software or open/close your connection on each page load.  As far as caching data in the session, this depends on how session data is being stored, how much security you need, and whether or not the data is specific to the user.  A better bet would be to use something else for caching data.&lt;/p&gt;

The system base should have support for finding out about plugins, starting them up and being able to provide ways for those modules to communicate. Ideally, one should be able to put in new modules and yank out unused modules at will, and modules should be able to use each other's funcionality if it is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This system should be used as a basis for simulation systems where a lot of stuff happens in different modules, and other modules might want to do something based on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system I intend to develop is going to be in Java. The way I see it, I intend to have a folder with a subfolder for each module that includes a XML that describes the module with information such as name, maybe which events it might raise, stuff like that. I suppose I might need to write a custom ClassLoader to work this stuff out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, I don't know if my idea actually holds any water and, of course, I intend on building a working prototype. However, I never worked on a truly modular system before, and I'm not really sure what is the best way to take on this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where should I start? Are there common problems and pitfalls that are found while developing this kind of system? How do I make the modules talk with each other while maintaining isolation (i.e, you remove a module and another module that was using it stays sane)? Are there any guides, specifications or articles I can read that could give me some ideas on where to start? It would be better if they were based on Java, but this is not a requirement, as what I'm looking for right now are ideas, not code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any feedback is appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

I prefer to use a SQL database for data.  XML is error prone as you can cause subtle errors due to typos or ommissions in the data itself. Some open source application frameworks use too many xml files for configuration, data, etc. I prefer to have it in SQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since you ask for a rule of thumb, I would say that use XML based application data, configuration, etc if you are going to set it up once and not access/search it much. For active searches and updations, its best to go with SQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a web server stores application data in a XML file and you dont really need to perform complex search, update the file. The web server starts, reads the xml file and thats that. So XML is perfect here.  Suppose you use a framework like Struts. You need to use XML and the action configurations dont change much once the application is developed and deployed. So again, the XML file is a good way.  Now if your Struts developed application allows extensive searches and updations, deletions, then SQL is the optimal way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offcourse, you will surely meet one or two developers in your organisation who will chant XML or SQL only and proclaim XML or SQL as the only way to go. Beware of such folks and do what 'feels' right for your application. Dont just follow a 'technology religion'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of things like how often you need to update the data, how often you need to search the data. Then you will have your answer on what to use - XML or SQL. &lt;/p&gt;

For your case (cache), it seems to me that using sqlite (or other embedded dbs) makes more sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I don't really think that sqlite will need more overhead than XML. And I mean both development time overhead and runtime overhead. Only problem is that you have a dependance on sqlite library. But since you would need some library for XML anyway it doesn't matter (I assume project is in C/C++).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages of sqlite over xml:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;everything in one file,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;performance loss is lower than XML as cache gets bigger,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can keep feed metadata separate from cache itself (other table), but accessible in the same way,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQL is probably easier to work with than XPath for most people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages of sqlite:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can be problematic with multiple processes accessing same database (probably not your case),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you should know at least basic SQL. Unless there will be hundreds of thousands of items in cache, I don't think you will need to optimize it much,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe in some way it can be more dangerous from security standpoint (SQL injection). On the other hand, you are not coding web app, so this should not happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other things are on par for both solutions probably. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum it up, answers to your questions respectively:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will not know, unless you test your specific application with both backends. Otherwise it's always just a guess. Basic support for both caches should not be a problem to code. Then benchmark and compare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the way XML files are organized, sqlite searches should always be faster (barring some corner cases where it doesn't matter anyway because it's blazingly fast). Speeding up searches in XML would require index database anyway, in your case that would mean having cache for cache, not a particularly good idea. But with sqlite you can have indexing as part of database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Do you work for a company that starts with "I", that has a website that starts with "BC"?

In general, eschew session as much as possible. Certainly, non-serializable objects shouldn't be stored there (database connections and such), but even big, serializable objects shouldn't be either. You just don't want the overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

Storing a reference to any object that is holding system resources open (particularly a database connection) is a definite scalability killer. Also, storing uncommitted data in a session variable is just a bad idea in most cases. Overall it sounds like the current implementation is abusively using session objects to try and simulate a stateful application in a supposedly stateless environment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it is much maligned, the ASP.NET model of managing state automatically through hidden fields should really eliminate the majority of the need to keep anything in session variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My rule of thumb is that the more scalable (in terms of users/hits) that the app needs to be, the less you can get away with using session state. There is, however, a trade-off. For web applications where the user is repeatedly accessing the same data and typically has a fairly long session per use of the site, some caching (if necessary in session objects) can actually help scalability by reducing the load on the DB server. The idea here is that it is much cheaper and less complex to farm the presentation layer than the back-end DB. Of course, with all things, this advice should be taken in moderation and doesn't apply in all situations, but for a fairly simple in-house CRUD app, it should serve you well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Matrix borders are set to None, then the borders on the cells don't show up in XLS. So, how do you set an outer border around the Matrix, but not have it apply the 'all sides' border to every cell that touches the edge of the Matrix when exported to Excel?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: Just to discuss further in case of SOAP, let's say the client makes a websvc call which is supposed to be a notification message (no return value expected), so everything goes smooth and no exceptions are thrown by the svc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now how will the client know if the notification call has gotten lost due to a communication/network problem or something in between the server and the client? compare this with not having any exception thrown. Client might assume it's a success. But it's not. The call got lost somewhere. 
Does sending a 'success' error code ensures to the client that the call went smooth? is there any other way to achieve this or is the scenario above even possible?&lt;/p&gt;

A few additional comments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drawback - AFAIK, you're stuck with developing your proxies in VS2003&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drawback - the documentation of the BAPIs is pretty slim. I spend a lot (I mean a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) of time in SE37 inside SAP looking at the RFC documentation and stepping through the functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positive - it took me a while to realize that you could rename and remove parameters and rename methods in VS2003 before building the proxy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drawback - if you do the above-mentioned renaming you need to redo it every time you repopulate the RFC from the SAP server (like if your SAP developer makes changes to a BAPI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, complicated functions are difficult with the .Net Connector (I just spent 3 weeks getting customer creation and modification working), but simple functions are pretty transparent, and if you have an ABAP developer available to you on the SAP side and can develop custom BAPIs it works really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start with a blank area (perhaps a rectangle set to 0,0,0,0 - something you can detect as 'no update required')&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each dirty area added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Normalize the new area (i.e. ensure that left is less than right, top less than bottom)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the dirty rectangle is currently empty, set it to the supplied area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Otherwise, set the left and top co-ordinates of the dirty rectangle to the smallest of {dirty,new}, and the right and bottom co-ordinates to the largest of {dirty,new}.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows, at least, maintains an &lt;em&gt;update region&lt;/em&gt; of the changes that it's been informed of, and any repainting that needs to be done due to the window being obscured and revealed. A &lt;em&gt;region&lt;/em&gt; is an object that is made up of many possibly discontinuous rectangles, polygons and ellipses. You tell Windows about a part of the screen that needs to be repainted by calling InvalidateRect - there is also an InvalidateRgn function for more complicated areas. If you choose to do some painting before the next WM_PAINT message arrives, and you want to exclude that from the dirty area, there are ValidateRect and ValidateRgn functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you start painting with BeginPaint, you supply a PAINTSTRUCT that Windows fills with information about what needs to be painted. One of the members is the smallest rectangle that contains the invalid region. You can get the region itself using GetUpdateRgn (you must call this before BeginPaint, because BeginPaint marks the whole window as valid) if you want to minimize drawing when there are multiple small invalid areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would assume that, as minimizing drawing was important on the Mac and on X when those environments were originally written, there are equivalent mechanisms for maintaining an update region.&lt;/p&gt;

An interesting experiment is to pack up your apartment and put everything in boxes, then move into the next apartment and not unpack anything until you need it. So you're making your first meal, and you're pulling something out of a box. Then after a month or so you've used that to pretty much figure out what things in your life you actually need, and then you take the rest of the stuff -- forget how much you like it or how cool it is -- and you just throw it away. It's amazing how that simplifies your life, and you can use that principle in all kinds of design issues: not do things just because they're cool or just because they're interesting."&lt;/p&gt;

When designing HTML email, the only thing that matters is what client your particular target population uses. This depends on geographical area, industry, B2B/B2C -- variations are huge in practice.

Outlook 2007 is not the only problematic client -- Gmail is also quite notorious for lacking support for a number of design elements others display just fine.

&lt;p&gt;Perl has all of CPAN - giving you a huge advantage in pulling together functionality quickly. It also has a nice flexible testing infrastructure that means you can plug lots of different automated testing styles (including tests in other languages) in the same framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby is a lovely language to learn - and lacks some of the cruft in Perl 5. If you're doing web based testing it also has the watir library - which is trez useful (see &lt;a href="http://wtr.rubyforge.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://wtr.rubyforge.org/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python - nice language and (while it's not to my personal preference) some folk find the way its structured easier to get to grips with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any of them (and many others) would be a great language to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of looking at the language - I'd look at your working environment. It's always easier to learn stuff if you have other folk around who are doing similar stuff. If you current dev/testing folk are already focussed on one of the above - I'd go for that. If not, pick the one that would be most applicable/useful to your current working environment. Chat to the rest of your team and see what they think.&lt;/p&gt;

The symbols will allow you to match memory addresses to function names. In order to do this you have to create a local folder in your machine in which you will store a local cache of symbols (for example: C:\symbols). Then you need to specify the symbols server path. To do this just go to: File &gt; Symbol File Path and type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SRV*c:\symbols*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find more information on how to correctly configure the symbols &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/debugging/debugstart.mspx#a"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have properly configured the Symbols server you can open the minidump from: File &gt; Open Crash Dump. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the minidump is opened it will show you on the left side of the command line the thread that was executing when the dump was generated. If you want to see what this thread was executing type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;kpn 200
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might take some time the first you execute it since it has to download the necessary public Microsoft related symbols the first time. Once all the symbols are downloaded you'll get something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;01 MODULE!CLASS.FUNCTIONNAME1(...)
02 MODULE!CLASS.FUNCTIONNAME2(...)
03 MODULE!CLASS.FUNCTIONNAME3(...)
04 MODULE!CLASS.FUNCTIONNAME4(...)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE FIRST NUMBER&lt;/strong&gt;: Indicates the frame number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MODULE&lt;/strong&gt;: The DLL that contains the code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLASS&lt;/strong&gt;: (Only on C++ code) will show you the class that contains the code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FUNCTIONAME&lt;/strong&gt;: The method that was called. If you have the correct symbols you will also see the parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might also see something like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;01 MODULE!+989823
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This indicates that you don't have the proper Symbol for this DLL and therefore you are only able to see the method offset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what is a callstack? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you have this code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void main()
{
  method1();
}

void method1()
{
  method2();
}

int method2()
{
  return 20/0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this code method2 basically will throw an Exception since we are trying to divide by 0 and this will cause the process to crash. If we got a minidump when this occurred we would see the following callstack:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;01 MYDLL!method2()
02 MYDLL!method1()
03 MYDLL!main()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow from this callstack that "main" called "method1" that then called "method2" and it failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your case you've got this callstack (which I guess is the result of running "kb" command)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;b69dd8f0 bfa1e255 016d2fc0 89efc000 00000040 nv4_disp+0x48b94
b69dd8f4 016d2fc0 89efc000 00000040 00000006 nv4_disp+0x49255
b69dd8f8 89efc000 00000040 00000006 bfa1dcc0 0x16d2fc0
b69dd8fc 00000000 00000006 bfa1dcc0 e1e71018 0x89efc000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first column indicates the Child Frame Pointer, the second column indicates the Return address of the method that is executing, the next three columns show the first 3 parameters that were passed to the method, and the last part is the DLL name (nv4_disp) and the offset of the method that is being executed (+0x48b94). Since you don't have the symbols you are not able to see the method name. I doubt tha NVIDIA offers public access to their symbols so I gues you can't get much information from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend you run "kpn 200". This will show you the full callstack and you might be able to see the origin of the method that caused this crash (if it was a Microsoft DLL you should have the proper symbols in the steps that I provided you).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least you know it's related to a NVIDIA bug ;-) Try upgrading the DLLs of this driver to the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;char **a;
const char** b = a;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can understand and accept this.&lt;br&gt;
The C++ solution to this problem is to change b to be a const char * const *, which disallows reassignment of the pointers and prevents you from circumventing const-correctness (&lt;a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/const-correctness.html#faq-18.17"&gt;C++ FAQ&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

const char* const* b = a;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in pure C, the corrected version (using const char * const *) still gives a warning, and I don't understand why.
Is there a way to get around this without using a cast?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clarify:&lt;br&gt;
1) Why does this generate a warning in C?  It should be entirely const-safe, and the C++ compiler seems to recognize it as such.&lt;br&gt;
2) What is the correct way to go about accepting this char** as a parameter while saying (and having the compiler enforce) that I will not be modifying the characters it points to?
For example, if I wanted to write a function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void f(const char* const* in) {
  // Only reads the data from in, does not write to it
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I wanted to invoke it on a char**, what would be the correct type for the parameter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of those facilities are not build-in features of the language, but library-based ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important is the &lt;strong&gt;RAII&lt;/strong&gt;, often ignored for years by C++ developers coming from the C world. &lt;strong&gt;Operator overloading&lt;/strong&gt; is often a misunderstood feature that enable both array-like behaviour (subscript operator), pointer like operations (smart pointers) and build-in-like operations (multiplying matrices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of &lt;strong&gt;exception&lt;/strong&gt; is often difficult, but with some work, can produce really robust code through &lt;strong&gt;exception safety&lt;/strong&gt; specifications (including code that won't fail, or that will have a commit-like features that is that will succeed, or revert back to its original state).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most famous of "hidden" feature of C++ is &lt;strong&gt;template metaprogramming&lt;/strong&gt;, as it enables you to have your program partially (or totally) executed at compile-time instead of runtime. This is difficult, though, and you must have a solid grasp on templates before trying it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other make uses of the multiple paradigm to produce "ways of programming" outside of C++'s ancestor, that is, C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using &lt;strong&gt;functors&lt;/strong&gt;, you can simulate functions, with the additional type-safety and being stateful. Using the &lt;strong&gt;command&lt;/strong&gt; pattern, you can delay code execution. Most other &lt;strong&gt;design patterns&lt;/strong&gt; can be easily and efficiently implemented in C++ to produce alternative coding styles not supposed to be inside the list of "official C++ paradigms".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using &lt;strong&gt;templates&lt;/strong&gt;, you can produce code that will work on most types, including not the one you thought at first. You can increase type safety,too (like an automated typesafe malloc/realloc/free). C++ object features are really powerful (and thus, dangerous if used carelessly), but even the &lt;strong&gt;dynamic polymorphism&lt;/strong&gt; have its static version in C++: the &lt;strong&gt;CRTP&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found that most "&lt;em&gt;Effective C++&lt;/em&gt;"-type books from Scott Meyers or "&lt;em&gt;Exceptional C++&lt;/em&gt;"-type books from Herb Sutter to be both easy to read, and quite treasures of info on known and less known features of C++.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among my preferred is one that should make the hair of any Java programmer rise from horror: In C++, &lt;strong&gt;the most object-oriented way to add a feature to an object is through a non-member non-friend function, instead of a member-function&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. class method), because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In C++, a class' interface is both its member-functions and the non-member functions in the same namespace&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;non-friend non-member functions have no privileged access to the class internal. As such, using a member function over a non-member non-friend one will weaken the class' encapsulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This never fails to surprise even experienced developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok lets rephrase the question more generically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using reflection, is there a way to dynamically call at runtime a base class method that you may be overriding. You cannot use the 'base' keyword at compile time because you cannot be sure it exists. At runtime I want to list my ancestors methods and call the ancestor methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried using GetMethods() and such but all they return are "pointers" to the most derived implementation of the method. Not an implementation on a base class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are developing a system in C# 3.0 with a relatively big class hierarchy. Some of these classes, anywhere in the hierarchy, have resources that need to be 
disposed of, those implement the &lt;strong&gt;IDisposable&lt;/strong&gt; interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, to facilitate maintenance and refactoring of the code I would like to find a way, for classes implementing IDisposable, 
to "automatically" call &lt;strong&gt;base.Dispose(bDisposing)&lt;/strong&gt; if any ancestors also implements IDisposable. This way, if some class higher up in the hierarchy starts implementing
or stops implementing IDisposable that will be taken care of automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue is two folds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, finding if any ancestors implements IDisposable. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, calling base.Dispose(bDisposing) conditionally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part, finding about ancestors implementing IDisposable, I have been able to deal with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part is the tricky one. Despite all my
efforts, I haven't been able to call base.Dispose(bDisposing) from a derived class. All my attempts failed. They either caused 
compilation errors or called the wrong Dispose() method, that is the most derived one, thus looping forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main issue is that you &lt;strong&gt;cannot actually refer to base.Dispose()&lt;/strong&gt; directly in your code if there is no such thing as an 
ancestor implementing it (&lt;em&gt;be reminded that there might have no ancestors yet implementing IDisposable, but I want the derived code to be ready when and if such 
a thing happens in the future&lt;/em&gt;). That leave us with the &lt;strong&gt;Reflection&lt;/strong&gt; mechanisms, but I did not find a proper way of doing it. Our code is quite filled with 
advanced reflection techniques and I think I did not miss anything obvious there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;My Solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My best shot yet was to have some conditional code using in commented code. Changing the IDisposable hierarchy would either break the build 
(if no IDisposable ancestor exists) or throw an exception (if there are IDisposable ancestors but base.Dispose is not called).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is some code I am posting to show you what my Dispose(bDisposing) method looks like. I am putting this code at the end of all the Dispose() 
methods throughout the hierarchy. Any new classes are created from templates that also includes this code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class MyOtherClassBase
{
    // ...
}


public class MyDerivedClass : MyOtherClassBase, ICalibrable
{

    private bool m_bDisposed = false;

    ~MyDerivedClass()
    {
        Dispose(false);
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }

    protected virtual void Dispose(bool bDisposing)
    {
        if (!m_bDisposed) {
            if (bDisposing) {
                // Dispose managed resources
            }
            // Dispose unmanaged resources
        }
        m_bDisposed = true;

        Type baseType = typeof(MyDerivedClass).BaseType;
        if (baseType != null) {
            if (baseType.GetInterface("IDisposable") != null) {
                // If you have no ancestors implementing base.Dispose(...), comment
                // the following line AND uncomment the throw. 
                //
                // This way, if any of your ancestors decide one day to implement 
                // IDisposable you will know about it right away and proceed to 
                // uncomment the base.Dispose(...) in addition to commenting the throw.
                //base.Dispose(bDisposing);
                throw new ApplicationException("Ancestor base.Dispose(...) not called - " 
                                               + baseType.ToString());
            }
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, I am asking is there a way to call base.Dispose() automatically/conditionally instead?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;More Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another mechanism in the application where all objects are registered with a main class. The class checks if they implement IDisposable. 
If so, they are disposed of properly by the application. This avoids having the code using the classes to deal with 
calling Dispose() all around by themselves. Thus, adding IDisposable to a class that has no ancestor history of IDisposable still works perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SQL Alchemy can do this -- but it isn't really a very complete solution.  Like iBatis, you can merely have SQL table definitions and a mapping between the tables and Python class definitions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's more complete is to have a class definition that is &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; the SQL database definition.  If the class definition generates the SQL Table DDL as well as the query and processing DML, that's much more complete.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I flip-flop between SQLAlchemy and the Django ORM.  SQLAlchemy can be used in an iBatis like manner.  But I prefer to make the object design central and leave the SQL implementation be derived from the objects by the toolset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use SQLAlchemy for large, batch, stand-alone projects.  DB Loads, schema conversions, DW reporting and the like work out well.  In these projects, the focus is on the relational view of the data, not the object model.  The SQL that's generated may be moved into PL/SQL stored procedures, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use Django for web applications, exploiting its built-in ORM capabilities.  You can, with a little work, segregate the Django ORM from the rest of the Django environment.  You can &lt;a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/settings/#using-settings-without-setting-django-settings-module"&gt;provide global settings&lt;/a&gt; to bind your app to a specific database without using a separate settings module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Django includes a number of common relationships (Foreign Key, Many-to-Many, One-to-One) for which it can manage the SQL implementation.  It generates key and index definitions for the attached database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your problem is largely object-oriented, with the database being used for persistence, then the nearly transparent ORM layer of Django has advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your problem is largely relational, with the SQL processing central, then the capability of seeing the generated SQL in SQLAlchemy has advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

Note, this is a pretty big exception.  There are a lot of scenarios that require, or are benefited by, pure-text file formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as overhead goes, SQLite compiles to something like 250 k with normal flags.  Many XML parsing libraries are larger than SQLite.  You get no concurrency gains using XML.  The SQLite binary file format is going to support much more efficient writes (largely because you can't append to the end of a well-formatted XML file).  And even reading data, most of which I assume is fairly random access, is going to be faster using SQLite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to top it all off, you get access to the benefits of SQL like transactions and indexes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit:  Forgot to mention.  One benefit of SQLite (as opposed to many databases) is that it allows any type in any row in any column.  Basically, with SQLite you get the same freedom you have with XML in terms of datatypes.  This also means that you don't have to worry about putting limits on text columns.&lt;/p&gt;

The software architecture involves a kernel driver that reads data into a pool of buffers, and a userland app that writes the data to a file on the mounted removable device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am finding that above a certain data rate (around 750kbyte/sec) I start to see the userland video-writing app stalling for maybe half a second, about every 5 seconds. This is enough to cause the kernel driver to run out of buffers - and even if I could increase the number of buffers, the video data has to be synchronised (ideally within 40ms) with other things that are going on in real time. Between these 5 second "lag spikes", the writes complete well within 40ms (as far as the app is concerned - I appreciate they're buffered by the OS)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this lag spike is to do with the way Linux is flushing data out to disk - I note that pdflush is designed to wake up every 5s, my understanding is that this would be what does the writing. As soon as the stall is over the userland app is able to quickly service and write the backlog of buffers (that didn't overflow).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the device I'm writing to has reasonable ultimate throughput: copying a 15MB file from a memory fs and waiting for sync to complete (and the usb stick's light to stop flashing) gave me a write speed of around 2.7MBytes/sec.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm looking for two kinds of clues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can I stop the bursty writing from stalling my app - perhaps process priorities, realtime patches, or tuning the filesystem code to write continuously rather than burstily?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can I make my app(s) aware of what is going on with the filesystem in terms of write backlog and throughput to the card/stick? I have the ability to change the video bitrate in the hardware codec on the fly which would be much better than dropping frames, or imposing an artificial cap on maximum allowed bitrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updates:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mounting the filesystem SYNC causes throughput to be much too poor.
&lt;li&gt;The removable media is FAT/FAT32 formatted and must be as the purpose of the design is that the media can be plugged into any Windows PC and read.
&lt;li&gt;Regularly calling sync() or fsync() say, every second causes regular stalls and unacceptably poor throughput
&lt;li&gt;I am using write() and open(O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC) rather than fopen() etc.
&lt;li&gt;I can't immediately find anything online about the mentioned "Linux realtime filesystems". Links?
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means is that you should mark variables that you share between threads as volatile so that you don't have situations where one thread starts modifying the value but doesn't write its result before a second thread comes along and tries to read the value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volatile is a compiler hint that disables certain optimizations. The output assembly of the compiler might have been safe without it but you should always use it for shared values. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is especially important if you are NOT using the expensive thread sync objects provided by your system - you might for example have a data structure where you can keep it valid with a series of atomic changes. Many stacks that do not allocate memory are examples of such data structures, because you can add a value to the stack then move the end pointer or remove a value from the stack after moving the end pointer. When implementing such a structure, volatile becomes crucial to ensure that your atomic instructions are actually atomic.&lt;/p&gt;

My project, x264, uses this method; threads share an enormous amount of data but the vast majority of it doesn't need mutexes because its either read-only or a thread will wait for the data to become available and finalized before it needs to access it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you have many threads that are all heavily interleaved in their operations (they depend on each others' output on a very fine-grained level), this may be a lot harder--in fact, in such a case I'd consider revisiting the threading model to see if it can possibly be done more cleanly with more separation between threads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage authentication,
authorization for
&lt;strong&gt;hundreds of thousands&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;em&gt;existing users&lt;/em&gt; currently tightly integrated with a 3rd party vendor's application (We want to bust these users out into something we manage and make our apps work against it, plus our 3rd party vendors work against it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage profile information linked to those users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be able to be accessed from any number of web applications on just about any platform (Windows, *nix, PHP, ASP/C#, Python/Django, et cetera).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here some sample implementations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LDAP/AD Server to manage everything. Use custom schema for all profile data.  Everything can authenticate against LDAP/AD and we can store all sorts of ACLs and profile data in a custom schema.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use LDAP/AD for authentication only, tie LDAP users to a most robust profile/authorization server using some sort of traditional database (MSSQL/PostgreSQL/MySQL) or document based DB (CouchDB, SimpleDB, et cetera).  Use LDAP for authorization, then hit the DB for more advanced stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a traditional database (Relational or Document) for everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are any of these three the best? Are there other solutions which fit the objectives above and are easier to implement?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** I should add that almost all applications that will be authenticating against the user database will be under our control.  The lone few outsiders will be the applications we're removing the current user database from and perhaps 1 or 2 others.  Nothing so broad as to need an openID server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its also important to know that a lot of these users have had these accounts for  5-8 years and know their logins and passwords, et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You've already identified the problem -- this code is not const-correct.  "Const correct" means that, except for const_cast and C-style casts removing const, you can never modify a const object through those const pointers or references.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of const-correctness -- const is there, in large part, to detect programmer errors.  If you declare something as const, you're stating that you don't think it should be modified -- or at least, those with access to the const version only should not be able to modifying it.  Consider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void foo(const int*);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As declared, foo doesn't have &lt;em&gt;permission&lt;/em&gt; to modify the integer pointed to by its argument.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're not sure why the code you posted isn't const-correct, consider the following code, only slightly different from HappyDude's code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;char *y;

char **a = &amp;amp;y; // a points to y
const char **b = a; // now b also points to y

// const protection has been violated, because:

const char x = 42; // x must never be modified
*b = &amp;amp;x; // the type of *b is const char *, so set it 
         //     with &amp;amp;x which is const char* ..
         //     ..  so y is set to &amp;amp;x... oops;
*y = 43; // y == &amp;amp;x... so attempting to modify const 
         //     variable.  oops!  undefined behavior!
cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; x &amp;lt;&amp;lt; endl;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-const types can only convert to const types in particular ways to prevent any circumvention of 'const' on a data-type without an explicit cast.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objects initially declared const are particularly special -- the compiler can assume they never change.  However, if 'b' can be assigned the value of 'a' without a cast, then you could inadvertantly attempt to modify a const variable.  This would not only break the check you asked the compiler to make, to disallow you from changing that variables value -- it would also allow you break the compiler optimizations!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On some compilers, this will print '42', on some '43', and others, the program will crash.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit-add:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HappyDude:  Your comment is spot on.  Either the C langauge, or the C compiler you're using, treats const char * const * fundamentally differently than the C++ language treats it.  Perhaps consider silencing the compiler warning for this source line only.&lt;/p&gt;

up many times in Graphical and Scientific applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the solution you require it may be rather complex under the hood, in this 
case less code doesn't necessarily mean faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"but this makes it quite tedious to use"&lt;/em&gt; --- generally, you can get around this by 
typedefs or wrapper classes (wrappers in this case would be highly recommended).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't need to use the 3D co-ordinates in any kind of spacially significant way ( 
things like "give me all the points within X distance of point P") then I suggest you 
just find a way to hash each point, and use a single hash map... O(n) creation, O(1) 
access (checking to see if it's been processed), you can't do much better than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do need more spacial information you'll need a container that explicitly takes 
it into account. 
The type of container you choose will be dependant on your data set. If you have good 
knowledge of the range of values that you recieve this will help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are recieving well distributed data over a known range... go with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree" rel="nofollow"&gt;octree&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a distribution that tends to cluster, then go with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kd_tree" rel="nofollow"&gt;k-d trees&lt;/a&gt;. You'll need 
to rebuild a k-d tree after inputting new co-ordinates (not necessarily every time, 
just when it becomes overly imbalanced). Put simply, Kd-trees are like Octrees, but with non uniform division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/env python
import pygame

class DirtyRectSprite(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    """Sprite with image and rect attributes."""
    def __init__(self, some_image, *groups):

        pass #do something here

def main():
    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((640, 480))
    background = pygame.image.load(open("some_bg_image.png")).convert()
    render_group = pygame.sprite.RenderUpdates()

        pygame.display.update(render_group.draw(screen))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're not using Python+Pygame, here's what I would do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a Sprite class that's update(),
move() etc. method sets a "dirty"
flag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep a rect for each sprite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your API supports updating a list of rects, use that on the list of rects whose sprites are dirty.  In SDL, this is SDL_UpdateRects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your API doesn't support updating a list of rects (I've never had the chance to use anything besides SDL so I wouldn't know), test to see if it's quicker to call the blit function multiple times or once with a big rect.  I doubt that any API would be faster using one big rect, but again, I haven't used anything besides SDL.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try using fsync()/sync() to force the kernel to flush data to the storage device more frequently. It sounds like the kernel buffers all your writes and then ties up the bus or otherwise stalls your system while performing the actual write. With careful calls to fsync() you can try to schedule writes over the system bus in a more fine grained way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might make sense to structure the application in such a way that the encoding/capture (you didn't mention video capture, so I'm making an assumption here - you might want to add more information) task runs in its own thread and buffers its output in userland - then, a second thread can handle writing to the device. This will give you a smoothing buffer to allow the encoder to always finish its writes without blocking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that sounds suspicious is that you only see this problem at a certain data rate - if this really was a buffering issue, I'd expect the problem to happen less frequently at lower data rates, but I'd still expect to see this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, more information might prove useful. What's your system's architecture? (In very general terms.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the additional information you provided, it sounds like the device's throughput is rather poor for small writes and frequent flushes. If you're sure that for larger writes you can get sufficient throughput (and I'm not sure that's the case, but the file system might be doing something stupid, like updating the FAT after every write) then having an encoding thread piping data to a writing thread with sufficient buffering in the writing thread to avoid stalls. I've used shared memory ring buffers in the past to implement this kind of scheme, but any IPC mechanism that would allow the writer to write to the I/O process without stalling unless the buffer is full should do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this gives me the behaviour I want.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Id="78235" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="75701" CreationDate="2008-09-16T23:11:06.293" Score="24" Body="&lt;p&gt;In a Windows C++ DLL, all global objects (including static members of classes) will be constructed just before the calling of the DllMain with DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, and they will be destroyed just after the call of the DllMain with DLL_PROCESS_DETACH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you must consider three problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0 - Of course, global non-const objects are evil (but you already know that, so I'll avoid mentionning multithreading, locks, god-objects, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 - The order of construction of objects or different compilation units (i.e. CPP files) is not guaranteed, so you can't hope the object A will be constructed before B if the two objects are instanciated in two different CPPs. This is important if B depends on A. The solution is to move all global objects in the same CPP file, as inside the same compilation unit, the order of instanciation of the objects will be the order of construction (and the inverse of the order of destruction)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 - There are things that are forbidden to do in the DllMain. Those things are probably forbidden, too, in the constructors. So avoid locking something. See Raymond Chen's excellent blog on the subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/27/63401.aspx"&gt;http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/27/63401.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/28/63880.aspx"&gt;http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/28/63880.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, lazy initialization could be interesting: The classes remain in an "un-initialized" state (internal pointers are NULL, booleans are false, whatever) until you call one of their methods, at which point they'll initialize themselves. If you use those objects inside the main (or one of the main's descendant functions), you'll be ok because they will be called after execution of DllMain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 - Of course, if some global objects in DLL A depend on global objects in DLL B, you should be very very careful about DLL loading order, and thus dependancies. In this case, DLLs with direct or indirect circular dependancies will cause you an insane amount of headaches. The best solution is to break the circular dependancies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S.: Note that in C++, constructor can throw, and you doesn't want an exception in the middle of a DLL loading, so be sure your global objects won't be using exception without a very very good reason. As correctly written destructors are not authorized to throw, the DLL unloading should be ok in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;openGL (I need 3D, blending, textures etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pyopengl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wx/pywx - windowing, dialogs etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last component - WX - raises the question. I can put together a very nice looking app (the prototypes look slick) - but when I need to interact with the user to ask questions, get input, I have to use WX. It makes the app look inconsistent to have traditional UI with traditional dialogs and combos and text entry on top of a full screen 3D app with blending, smooth motion, textures etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone developed a GUI using OpenGL and python? Can you share with me the toolkits and/or tricks you used? I need combos, text entry, buttons, radios, option buttons, tree view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some toolkits out there, but they are either incomplete or old and unmaintained. A great example is pyUI (http://pyui.sourceforge.net/) - looks slick but untouched for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start your application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new named mutex and take ownership over it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start a new process (process not thread) or a new application, what you preffer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From that process / application try to aquire the mutex. The process will block&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When application finish release the mutex (signal it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The "control" process will only aquire the mutex if either the application finishes or the application crashes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test the resulting state after aquiring the mutex. If the application had crashed it will be WAIT_ABANDONED&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explanation:&lt;/strong&gt; When a thread finishes without releasing the mutex any other process waiting for it can aquire it but it will obtain a WAIT_ABANDONED as return value, meaning the mutex is abandoned and therfore the state of the section it was protected can be unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way your second app won't consume any CPU cycles as it will keep waiting for the mutex (and that's enterely handled by the operating system)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make sure you are using a lower level API for writing to the disk, don't use user-mode caching functions like &lt;code&gt;fopen, fread, fwrite&lt;/code&gt; use the lower level functions &lt;code&gt;open, read, write&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pass the &lt;code&gt;O_SYNC&lt;/code&gt; flag when you open the file, this will cause each write operation to block until written to disk, which will remove the bursty behavior of your writes...with the expense of each write being slower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are doing reads/ioctls from a device to grab a chunk of video data, you may want to consider allocating a shared memory region between the application and kernel, otherwise you are getting hit with a bunch of &lt;code&gt;copy_to_user&lt;/code&gt; calls when transferring video data buffers from kernel space to user space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may need to validate that your USB flash device is fast enough with sustained transfers to write the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

If you're on a shared server the decision has already been taken for you, usually on the CGI side. The reason for this are filesystem permissions. PHP as a module runs with the permissions of the http server (usually 'apache') and unless you can chmod your scripts to that user you have to chmod them to 777 - world readable. This means, alas, that your server neighbour can take a look at them - think of where you store the database access password. Most shared servers have solved this using stuff like phpsuexec and such, which run scripts with the permissions of the script owner, so you can (must) have your code chmoded to 644. Phpsuexec runs only with PHP as CGI - that's more or less all, it's just a local machine thing - makes no difference to the world at large.&lt;/p&gt;

They should always call their base Dispose(bool) method, which will chain up to the top class in the hierarchy eventually. Only those classes which override it will be called, so the chain is usually quite short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finalizers, spelled ~Class in C#: Don't. Very few classes will need one, and it's very easy to accidentally keep large object graphs around, because the finalizers require at least two collections before the memory is released. On the first collection after the object is no longer referenced, it's put on a queue of finalizers to be run. These are run &lt;em&gt;on a separate, dedicated thread&lt;/em&gt; which only runs finalizers (if it gets blocked, no more finalizers run and your memory usage explodes). Once the finalizer has run, the next collection that collects the appropriate generation will free the object and anything else it was referencing that isn't otherwise referenced. Unfortunately, because it survives the first collection, it will be placed into the older generation which is collected less frequently. For this reason, you should Dispose early and often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, you should implement a small resource wrapper class that &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; manages the resource lifetime and implement a finalizer on that class, plus IDisposable. The user of the class should then call Dispose on this when it is disposed. There shouldn't be a back-link to the user. That way, only the thing that actually needs finalization ends up on the finalization queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are going to need them anywhere in the hierarchy, the base class that implements IDisposable should implement the finalizer and call Dispose(bool), passing false as the parameter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WARNING for Windows Mobile developers (VS2005 and 2008, .NET Compact Framework 2.0 and 3.5): many non-controls that you drop onto your designer surface, e.g. menu bars, timers, HardwareButtons, derive from System.ComponentModel.Component, which implements a finalizer. For desktop projects, Visual Studio adds the components to a System.ComponentModel.Container named &lt;code&gt;components&lt;/code&gt;, which it generates code to Dispose when the form is Disposed - it in turn Disposes all the components that have been added. For the mobile projects, the code to Dispose &lt;code&gt;components&lt;/code&gt; is generated, &lt;em&gt;but dropping a component onto the surface does not generate the code to add it to &lt;code&gt;components&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. You have to do this yourself in your constructor after calling InitializeComponent.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of E_STRICT errors are evaluated at the compile time thus such errors are not reported in the file where error_reporting is enhanced to include E_STRICT errors (and vice versa).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your underlying system is configured to report E_STRICT errors, these may be output before your code is even considered. Don't forget, error_reporting/ini_set are runtime evaluations, and anything performed in a "before-run" phase will not see their effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on your comment that your error is...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_VARIABLE, expecting ',' or ';' in /usr/home/REDACTED/public_html/dev.php on line 11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the same general concept applies. Your code is never run, as it is syntactically invalid (you forgot a ';'). Therefore, your change of error reporting is never encountered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixing this requires a change of the system level error reporting. For example, on Apache you may be able to place...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;php_value error_reporting 0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in a .htaccess file to suppress them all, but this is system configuration dependent.&lt;/p&gt;

(There are exceptions to this, e.g. a well engineered suit of browser tests can run not much slower than typical unit tests.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way of integration is to have an overnight build or continuous build, that runs all the time, and can take several hours to build and run all the tests. If a build passes all the tests (unit test + system tests), it becomes releasable, you can deliver that binary or the snapshot of  source code. The idea is to have x versions of your binaries/code snapshots, verify them asynchronously, and deliver the green builds. This should work both with automated system tests as well as manual ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reasons to use exceptions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The code flow for the common case is clearer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can return complex error information as an object (although this can also be achieved using error "out" parameter passed by reference)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Languages generally provide some facility for managing tidy cleanup in the event of the exception (try/finally in Java, using in C#, RAII in C++)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the event no exception is thrown, execution can &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt; be faster than checking return codes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Java, checked exceptions must be declared or caught (although this can be a reason against)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reasons not to use exceptions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes it's overkill if the error handling is simple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If exceptions are not documented or declared, they may be uncaught by calling code, which may be worse than if the the calling code just ignored a return code (application exit vs silent failure - which is worse may depend on the scenario)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In C++, code that uses exceptions must be exception safe (even if you don't throw or catch them, but call a throwing function indirectly)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In C++, it is hard to tell when a function might throw, therefore you must be paranoid about exception safety if you use them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throwing and catching exceptions is generally significantly more expensive compared to checking a return flag&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, I would be more inclined to use exceptions in Java than in C++ or C#, because I am of the opinion that an exception, declared or not, is fundamentally part of the formal interface of a function, since changing your exception guarantee may break calling code. The biggest advantage of using them in Java IMO, is that you know that your caller MUST handle the exception, and this improves the chance of correct behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, in any language, I would always derive all exceptions in a layer of code or API from a common class, so that calling code can always guarantee to catch all exceptions. Also I would consider  it bad to throw exception classes that are implementation-specific, when writing an API or library (i.e.  wrap exceptions from lower layers so that the exception that your caller receives is understandable in the context of your interface).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that Java makes the distinction between general and Runtime exceptions in that the latter need not be declared. I would only use Runtime exception classes when you know that the error is a result of a bug in the program.&lt;/p&gt;

Individual checkins are completed to the satisfaction of the developer doing the change (including tests where possible) but sometimes the direction of work changes slightly and previous commits need to be reverted and done another way. Or, stub code is filled out in later commits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes time for code review, there's a sequence of commits all tagged with the same bug tracking id number. It's easy to get a list of such changes. When a reviewer looks through the changes one by one, sometimes there will be a commit A that is undone or modified by a later commit B as part of the same review. This can make reviewing more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If only one developer was working on the file for the duration of the change, then it's easy to do a diff between the original state of the file and the final state of the file. The problem arises when another developer happens to have made unrelated changes in the same file, or even in the same functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you handle this situation? Are there tools that, given a sequence of patches to a file, can give the moral equivalent of a diff between the first and last versions, but only including a subset of those patches?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come to think of it, I could create a temporary branch in git starting from before the first related change, and cherry-pick the changes relevant to the review. Hopefully there won't be too many conflicts that need to be resolved (and if there are, then the whole lot should be reviewed at once anyway). Any other ideas?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More info: This happens to be a big legacy system where a single change might touch multiple files. The files are big and crufty - too big to just review the final product without an indication of what might have changed.&lt;/p&gt;

Choices of other mechanisms include cookies, content negotiation, session identifiers or, if your users are identified, a persistent user preferences model. Even using a URL argument would at least keep the root of the URL consistent (e.g. &lt;code&gt;http://your.si.te/foobar&lt;/code&gt; vs. &lt;code&gt;http://your.si.te/foobar?view=plain&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

(If you think you can be clever and avoid locks, don't.  You aren't.  That's the general "you" which includes me and everybody else.)  You should at minimum use a spin lock, see &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man3/spinlock.3.html"&gt;spinlock(3)&lt;/a&gt;.  And whatever you do, &lt;strong&gt;don't&lt;/strong&gt; try to implement "your own" locks.  You will get it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, you need to use whatever locking or atomic operations your operating system provides.  Getting these sorts of things &lt;strong&gt;exactly right&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;all cases&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;extremely difficult&lt;/strong&gt;.  Often it can involve knowledge of things like the errata for specific versions of specific processor.  ("Oh, version 2.0 of that processor didn't do the cache-coherency snooping at the right time, it's fixed in version 2.0.1 but on 2.0 you need to insert a &lt;code&gt;NOP&lt;/code&gt;.")  Just slapping a &lt;code&gt;volatile&lt;/code&gt; keyword on a variable in C is almost always insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Mac OS X, that means you need to use the functions listed in &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man3/atomic.3.html"&gt;atomic(3)&lt;/a&gt; to perform truly atomic-across-all-CPUs operations on 32-bit, 64-bit, and pointer-sized quantities.  (Use the latter for any atomic operations on pointers so you're 32/64-bit compatible automatically.)  That goes whether you want to do things like atomic compare-and-swap, increment/decrement, spin locking, or stack/queue management.  Fortunately the &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man3/spinlock.3.html"&gt;spinlock(3)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man3/atomic.3.html"&gt;atomic(3)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man3/barrier.3.html"&gt;barrier(3)&lt;/a&gt; functions should all work correctly on all CPUs that are supported by Mac OS X.&lt;/p&gt;

You will need to do several things, not all of which are portable, to ensure that the compiler has done things in the order you want them done (the volatile keyword may help to a certain extent) and that memory is consistent.

Any updates are first made in the database and then migrated into the source code repository so a history of changes is maintained.&lt;br /&gt;
As a second step, all database changes are migrated to an integration database.  This integration database represents exactly what the production database should look like post deployment.  We also have a QA database which represents the current state of production (or the last deployment).  Once all changes are made in the Integration database, we use a schema diff tool (Red Gate's SQL Diff for SQL Server) to generate a script that will migrate all changes from one database to the other.&lt;br /&gt;
We have found this to be fairly effective as it generates a single script that we can integrate with our installers easily.  The biggest issue we often have is developers forgetting to migrate their changes into integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Fingerprint's fee is out of the question, you can collect your own statistics. Include hyperlinks in your HTML. When your CGI application receives requests from these hyperlinks, it can save the HTTP_USER_AGENT in a database for your statistical analysis.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use HTML tables to control the design layout and some presentation. You may be used to using pure CSS layouts for your web pages, but that approach just won't hold up in an email environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use inline CSS to control other presentation elements within your email, such as background colors and fonts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 - use int instead of enums: Declare your ints in an anonymous namespace in your CPP file (not in the header):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;namespace
{
   const int FUNCTIONALITY_NORMAL = 0 ;
   const int FUNCTIONALITY_RESTRICTED = 1 ;
   const int FUNCTIONALITY_FOR_PROJECT_X = 2 ;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As your methods are private, no one will mess with the data. You could even go further to test if someone sends you an invalid data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;namespace
{
   const int FUNCTIONALITY_begin = 0 ;
   const int FUNCTIONALITY_NORMAL = 0 ;
   const int FUNCTIONALITY_RESTRICTED = 1 ;
   const int FUNCTIONALITY_FOR_PROJECT_X = 2 ;
   const int FUNCTIONALITY_end = 3 ;

   bool isFunctionalityCorrect(int i)
   {
      return (i &amp;gt;= FUNCTIONALITY_begin) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (i &amp;lt; FUNCTIONALITY_end) ;
   }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 : create a full class with limited const instantiations, like done in Java. Forward declare the class, and then define it in the CPP file, and instanciate only the enum-like values. I did something like that in C++, and the result was not as satisfying as desired, as it needed some code to simulate an enum (copy construction, operator =, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 : As proposed before, use the privately declared enum. Despite the fact an user will see its full definition, it won't be able to use it, nor use the private methods. So you'll usually be able to modify the enum and the content of the existing methods without needing recompiling of code using your class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My guess would be either the solution 3 or 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const volatile int *const serial_port = SERIAL_PORT;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which is valid code. How can volatile and const co-exist? Simple. volatile tells the compiler to always read the memory when using the data and const tells the compiler to create an error when an attempt is made to write to the memory using the serial_port pointer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does const help the compiler's optimiser? No. Not at all. Because constness can be added to and removed from data through casting, the compiler cannot figure out if const data really is constant (since the cast could be done in a different translation unit). In C++ you also have the mutable keyword to complicate matters further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;char *const p = (char *) 0xb000;
//error: p = (char *) 0xc000;
char **q = (char **)&amp;amp;p;
*q = (char *)0xc000; // p is now 0xc000

&lt;p&gt;What happens when an attempt is made to write to memory that really is read only (ROM, for example) probably isn't defined in the standard at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Sometimes members are initialized by default, sometimes they aren't&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local clases can't be used as template parameters (makes them less useful)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;hidden feature: function try blocks. Unfortunately I haven't found a use for it. Yes I know why they added it, but you have to rethrow in a constructor which makes it pointless.&lt;/li&gt;

There isn't a provided atomic get or set for either 32 or 64 bit integers, but you can build that out of the provided CompareAndSwap. You may wish to search XCode documentation for the various OSAtomic functions. I've written the 64-bit version below. The 32-bit version can be done with similarly named functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;libkern/OSAtomic.h&amp;gt;
// bool OSAtomicCompareAndSwap64Barrier(int64_t oldValue, int64_t newValue, int64_t *theValue);

void AtomicSet(uint64_t *target, uint64_t new_value)
{
 while (true)
 {
  uint64_t old_value = *target;
  if (OSAtomicCompareAndSwap64Barrier(old_value, new_value, target)) return;
 }
}

uint64_t AtomicGet(uint64_t *target)
{
 while (true)
 {
  int64 value = *target;
  if (OSAtomicCompareAndSwap64Barrier(value, value, target)) return value;
 }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that Apple's OSAtomicCompareAndSwap functions atomically perform the operation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (*theValue != oldValue) return false;
*theValue = newValue;
return true;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use this in the example above to create a Set method by first grabbing the old value, then attempting to swap the target memory's value. If the swap succeeds, that indicates that the memory's value is still the old value at the time of the swap, and it is given the new value during the swap (which itself is atomic), so we are done. If it doesn't succeed, then some other thread has interfered by modifying the value in-between when we grabbed it and when we tried to reset it. If that happens, we can simply loop and try again with only minimal penalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea behind the Get method is that we can first grab the value (which may or may not be the actual value, if another thread is interfering). We can then try to swap the value with itself, simply to check that the initial grab was equal to the atomic value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven't checked this against my compiler, so please excuse any typos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You mentioned OSX specifically, but in case you need to work on other platforms, Windows has a number of Interlocked* functions, and you can search the MSDN documentation for them. Some of them work on Windows 2000 Pro and later, and some (particularly some of the 64-bit functions) are new with Vista. On other platforms, GCC versions 4.1 and later have a variety of __sync* functions, such as __sync_fetch_and_add(). For other systems, you may need to use assembly, and you can find some implementations in the SVN browser for the HaikuOS project, inside src/system/libroot/os/arch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a technique that ensure to hide the class internals in the headers by just declaring:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class A 
{
public:
    ...
private:
    void* pImpl;
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in your implementation file (cpp), you declare a class that will be the representation of the internals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class AImpl
{
public:
    AImpl(A* pThis): m_pThis(pThis) {}

    ... all private methods here ...
private:
    A* m_pThis;
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must dynamically create the implementation in the class constructor and delete it in the destructor and when implementing public method, you must use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;((AImpl*)pImpl)-&amp;gt;PrivateMethod();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are pros for using pimpl, one is that it decouple your class header from its implementation, no need to recompile other classes when changing one class implementation. Another is that is speeds up your compilation time because your headers are so simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it's a pain to use, so you should really ask yourself if just declaring your enum as private in the header is that much a trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Special TableStyle Indeces [sic]&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;In any style command the first row index may be set to one of the special strings 'splitlast' or 'splitfirst' to indicate that the style should be used only for the last row of a split table, or the first row of a continuation.

('TEXTCOLOR', (0, 'splitfirst'), (1, 0), colors.black) 
('TEXTCOLOR', (0, 'splitfirst'), (1, -1), colors.black)

&lt;p&gt;First lets walk through the problem.
It is assumed that you will typically need to generate multiple rows in SpeciesFoundInCountry for every row in the original table. In other words species tend to be in more then one country. This is actually easy to do with a Cartesian product, a join with no join criteria. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do a Cartesian product you will need to create the Country table. The table should have the country_id from 1 to N (N being the number of unique countries, 200 or so) and country name. To make life easy just use the numbers 1 to N in column order. That would make Afghanistan 1 and Albania 2 ... Zimbabwe N. You should be able to use the system tables to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next create a table or view from the original table which contains the species and a sting with a 0 or 1 for each country. You will need to convert the null, not null to a text 0 or 1 and concatenate all of the values into a single string. A description of the table and a text editor with regular expressions should make this easy. Experiment first with a single column and once that's working edit the create view/insert with all of the columns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next join the two tables together with no join criteria. This will give you a record for every species in every country, you're almost there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now all you have to do is filter out the records which are not valid, they will have a zero in the corresponding location in the string. Since the country table's country_code column has the substring location all you need to do is filter out the records where it's 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;where substring(new_column,country_code) = '1'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will still need to create the species table and join to that &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;where a.species_name = b.species_name
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a and b are table aliases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this help&lt;/p&gt;

LEFT OUTER JOIN  CompanyProduct AS CP ON C.CompanyID=CP.CompanyID
LEFT OUTER JOIN  Product AS P ON CP.ProductID=P.ProductID

Do you have a 4 socket machine filled with Quad Core Xeons, 128 GB of RAM, and Fiber Channel Connectivity (like the pair of Dell R900s we just bought)? Or are you running on a p3 550 with 256 MB of RAM, and 56K modem? How much load does each connection place on your server? What kind of response is acceptible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the questions you need to answer. I guess the best way to find the answer is through load testing. Create a unit test of the expected (and maybe some unexpected) paths that your code will perform against your server. Find a load testing framework that will allow you to simulate 10, 100, 1000, 10000 users performing those tasks at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That will tell you how many connections your computer can support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great thing about the load/unit test scenario is that you can put in response time expectations in your unit tests and increase the load until you fall outside of your response time. If you have a requirement of supporting X number of Users with Y second response, you will be able to demonstrate it with your load tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;lt;!-- similar for your second service --&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are require a transaction spanning both databases, then you will need to use a JTA transaction manager. The &lt;a href="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.5/api/org/springframework/orm/jpa/JpaTransactionManager.html"&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This transaction manager is appropriate for applications that use a single JPA EntityManagerFactory for transactional data access. JTA (usually through JtaTransactionManager) is necessary for accessing multiple transactional resources within the same transaction. Note that you need to configure your JPA provider accordingly in order to make it participate in JTA transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means is that you will need to provide a JTA transaction manager. In our application, we use config similar to the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;tx:annotation-driven transaction-manager="txManager"/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;bean id="txManager" 
    class="org.springframework.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionManager"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;property name="transactionManagerName" value="appserver/jndi/path" /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/bean&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are deploying within an appserver, then the spring JtaTransactionManager needs to do a lookup to the real XA-compliant JTA transaction manager provided by the appserver. However, you can also use a standalone JTA transaction manager (but I haven't tried this myself yet)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for configuring the Jpa persistence provider, I'm not that familiar. What JPA persistence provider are you using?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code above is based on our approach, where we were using native Hibernate as opposed to Hibernate's JPA implementation. In this case, we were able to get rid of the two HibernateTransactionManager beans, and simply ensure that both SessionFactories were injected with the same JTA TM, and then use the tx:annotation-driven element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the JVM requires the Java heap (or heaps if generational garbage collection is in use) to be a contiguous piece of memory, the whole maximum heap size (-mx value) is usually allocated at JVM start time.  In practice, the Java VM will attempt to minimise its use of this space so that the Operating System doesn't need to reserve any real memory to it (the OS is canny enough to know when a piece of storage has never been written to).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Java heap, therefore, will occupy a certain amount of space in memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the storage will be used by the Java VM and any JNI code in use.  For example, the JVM requires memory to store Java bytecode and constant pools from loaded classes, the result of JIT compiled code, work areas for compiling JIT code, native thread stacks and other such sundries.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JNI code is just platform-specific (compiled) C code that can be bound to a Java object in the form of a "native" method.  When this method is executed the bound code is executed and can allocate memory using standard C routines (eg malloc) which will consume memory on the C heap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OP realised from the example that you have to tell CryptGenKey how long the keys are, which you do by setting the top 16-bits of the flags to the number of bits you want to use. If you leave this as 0, you get the default key length. This &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; documented in the &lt;strong&gt;Remarks&lt;/strong&gt; section of the device documentation, and with the &lt;em&gt;dwFlags&lt;/em&gt; parameter in the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa379941(VS.85).aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;desktop documentation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Diffie-Hellman key-exchange algorithm, the Base provider defaults to 512-bit keys and the Enhanced provider (which is the default) defaults to 1024-bit keys, on Windows XP and later. There doesn't seem to be any documentation for the default lengths on CE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code should therefore be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;BYTE p[64] = { 139 }; // little-endian, all other bytes set to 0
BYTE g[64] = { 5 };

CRYPT_DATA_BLOB pblob;
pblob.cbData = sizeof( p);
pblob.pbData = p;

CRYPT_DATA_BLOB gblob;
gblob.cbData = sizeof( g );
gblob.pbData = g;

HCRYPTKEY hKey;
if ( ::CryptGenKey( m_hCryptoProvider, CALG_DH_SF,
                    ( 512 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 16 ) | CRYPT_PREGEN, &amp;amp;hKey ) )
{
    ::CryptSetKeyParam( hKey, KP_P, ( LPBYTE ) &amp;amp;pblob, 0 );
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

I have also created a new database on this same path and been able to succesfully detach and reattach it.  So I am confident permissions is not the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further investigation reveals that I cannot rename, copy or move the data files as Windows thinks they are locked - even when the SQL Server service is stopped.  Process Explorer does not show up any process locking the files.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I find out what is locking the files and unlock them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have verified that the databases do not show up in SSMS - so SQL Server does not still think they exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 18/09/2008&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried all of the suggested answers to date with no success.  However trying these suggestions has helped to clarify the situation.  I can verify the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can successfully detach and reattach the database only when the external drive is attached to the server that a copy of the database is restored to - effectively the server where the database is "created" - lets call this the "Source Server".  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can move, copy or rename the data and log files, after detaching the database, while the external drive is still attached to the Source Server.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As soon as I move the external drive to another machine the data and log files are "locked", although the 2 tools that I have tried - Process Explorer and Unlocker, both find no locking handles attached to the files. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NB.  After detaching the database I tried both stopping the SQL Server service and shutting down the Source Server prior to moving the external drive - still with no success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at this stage all that I can do to move data between desktop and laptop is to make a backup of the data onto the external drive, move the external drive, restore the data from the backup.  Works OK but takes a bit more time as the database is a reasonable size (1gb).  Anyway this is the only choice I have at this stage even though I was trying to avoid having to go down this path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/ruby/"&gt;Libcurl&lt;/a&gt; and net/http for web tool writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/eventmachine"&gt;EventMachine&lt;/a&gt; for web proxy and fuzzing work (or RFuzz, which extends the well-known Mongrel webserver).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://metasm.cr0.org/"&gt;Metasm&lt;/a&gt; for shellcode generation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ragestorm.net/distorm/"&gt;Distorm&lt;/a&gt; for x86 disassembly.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second place here goes to Python. There are more pentesting libraries available in Python than in Ruby (but not enough to offset Metasploit). Commercial tools tend to support Python as well --- if you're an Immunity CANVAS or CORE Impact customer, you want Python. Python gives you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/"&gt;Twisted&lt;/a&gt; for network access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.openrce.org/downloads/details/208/PaiMei"&gt;PaiMei&lt;/a&gt; for program tracing and programmable debugging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CANVAS and Impact support.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://pydbgeng.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Ready integration with WinDbg&lt;/a&gt; for remote Windows kernel debugging (there's still no good answer in Ruby for kernel debugging, which is why I still occasionally use Python). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://peachfuzzer.com/"&gt;Peach Fuzzer&lt;/a&gt; and Sully for fuzzing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SpikeProxy for web penetration testing (also, &lt;a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category%3aOWASP_Pantera_Web_Assessment_Studio_Project"&gt;OWASP Pantera&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, a lot of web work uses Java tools. The de facto standard web pentest tool is Burp Suite, which is a Java swing app. Both Ruby and Python have Java variants you can use to get access to tools like that. Also, both Ruby and Python offer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct integration with libpcap for raw packet work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenSSL bindings for crypto.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IDA Pro extensions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mature (or at least reasonable) C foreign function interfaces for API access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WxWindows for UI work, and decent web stacks for web UIs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You're not going to go wrong with either language, though for mainstream pentest work, Metasploit probably edges out all the Python benefits, and at present, for x86 reversing work, Python's superior debugging interfaces edge out all the Ruby benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also: it's 2008. They're not "scripting languages". They're programming languages. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Basically you need to implement IClonable interface and then realize object structure copying. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it's deep copy of all members, you need to insure (not relating on solution you choose) that all children are clonable as well. &lt;/li&gt;

Clone should do a memberwise copy and perform a deep copy on any member that requires it, then return the resulting object. This is a recursive operation ( it requires that all members of the class you want to clone are either value types or implement ICloneable and that their members are either value types or implement ICloneable, and so on).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a more detailed explanation on Cloning using ICloneable, check out this article: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2002/11/25/copying.html"&gt;http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2002/11/25/copying.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; answer is "it depends". As mentioned by others, ICloneable is not supported by generics, requires special considerations for circular class references, and is actually viewed by some as a &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2004/05/03/125427.aspx"&gt;"mistake"&lt;/a&gt; in the .NET Framework. The serialization method depends on your objects being serializable, which they may not be and you may have no control over. There is still much debate in the community over which is the "best" practice. In reality, none of the solutions are the one-size fits all best practice for all situations like ICloneable was originally interpreted to be.&lt;/p&gt;

I surely believe any application can be written faster and better using python.
QT4 is cross-platform, beautifull, implements everything you need from widgets (acessibility, etc...), and...it integrates with OpenGL. That means, you can simply have a widget that is a viewport to openGL stuff you render in your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another 3D capable solution  that would cover most things, but not so nioce on user interface is to extend Blender3D with a python script. It has the 3d capabilities and rendering , you script it in python all of the same, and it would be cross platform - and you get higher level tools for woriking with the 3D things than openGL alone.
There are obvious drawbacks, mainly from the UI standpoint when compared with PyQT but it could be done. &lt;/p&gt;

The closest thing to open-source that really works is using LumenVox
with Asterisk.  Asterisk is the open-source PBX that you can use to
integrate with a VoIP service or gateway, or even the PSTN.  LumenVox
is a commercial speech engine that integrates with Asterisk:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.asterisk.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.asterisk.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There's lots of people successfully using LumenVox with Asterisk.

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned elsewhere, it does require your objects to be serializable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Runtime.Serialization;
using System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary;

/// &amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;
/// Reference Article http://www.codeproject.com/KB/tips/SerializedObjectCloner.aspx
/// Provides a method for performing a deep copy of an object.
/// Binary Serialization is used to perform the copy.
/// &amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;
public static class ObjectCopier
{
    /// &amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;
    /// Perform a deep Copy of the object.
    /// &amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;
    /// &amp;lt;typeparam name="T"&amp;gt;The type of object being copied.&amp;lt;/typeparam&amp;gt;
    /// &amp;lt;param name="source"&amp;gt;The object instance to copy.&amp;lt;/param&amp;gt;
    /// &amp;lt;returns&amp;gt;The copied object.&amp;lt;/returns&amp;gt;
    public static T Clone&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(T source)
    {
        if (!typeof(T).IsSerializable)
        {
            throw new ArgumentException("The type must be serializable.", "source");
        }

        // Don't serialize a null object, simply return the default for that object
        if (Object.ReferenceEquals(source, null))
        {
            return default(T);
        }

        IFormatter formatter = new BinaryFormatter();
        Stream stream = new MemoryStream();
        using (stream)
        {
            formatter.Serialize(stream, source);
            stream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);
            return (T)formatter.Deserialize(stream);
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is that it serializes your object and then deserializes it into a fresh object. The benefit is that you don't have to concern yourself about cloning everything when an object gets too complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with the use of extension methods (also from the originally referenced source):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you prefer to use the new &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_method" rel="nofollow"&gt;extension methods&lt;/a&gt; of C# 3.0, change the method to have the following signature:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public static T Clone&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(this T source)
{
   //...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the method call simply becomes &lt;code&gt;objectBeingCloned.Clone();&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt; (January 10 2015) Thought I'd revisit this, to mention I recently started using (Newtonsoft) Json to do this, it &lt;a href="http://maxondev.com/serialization-performance-comparison-c-net-formats-frameworks-xmldatacontractserializer-xmlserializer-binaryformatter-json-newtonsoft-servicestack-text/" rel="nofollow"&gt;should be&lt;/a&gt; lighter, and avoids the overhead of [Serializable] tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/// &amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;
/// Perform a deep Copy of the object, using Json as a serialisation method.
/// &amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;
/// &amp;lt;typeparam name="T"&amp;gt;The type of object being copied.&amp;lt;/typeparam&amp;gt;
/// &amp;lt;param name="source"&amp;gt;The object instance to copy.&amp;lt;/param&amp;gt;
/// &amp;lt;returns&amp;gt;The copied object.&amp;lt;/returns&amp;gt;
public static T CloneJson&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(this T source)
{            
    // Don't serialize a null object, simply return the default for that object
    if (Object.ReferenceEquals(source, null))
    {
        return default(T);
    }

    return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(source));
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

All input is in Oracle database tables, and all output will be to Oracle database tables. The program should stay maintainable for many years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems straight-forward to implement this as a series of stored procedures, each performing a sensible transformation, for example distributing costs among departments according to some business rules. I can then write unit tests to check if the output of each transformation is as I expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it a bad idea to do this all in PL/SQL? Would you rather do heavy batch calculations in a typical object oriented programming language, such as C#? Isn't it more expressive to use a database centric programming language such as PL/SQL?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in both cases, remember to pass in a non-null TAIL parameter, and check that it points to the end of the string (that is, **TAIL == 0). Also check the return value for underflow and overflow (see the man pages or ANSI standard for details).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the JVM (a C program) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JNI Data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java byte codes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java data &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, they ALL live in the C heap (the JVM Heap is part of the C heap, naturally).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Java heap is simply Java byte codes and the Java data. But what is also in the Java heap is "free space".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typical (i.e. Sun) JVM only grows it Java Heap as necessary, but never shrinks it. Once it reaches its defined maximum (-Xmx512M), it stops growing and deals with whatever is left. When that maximum heap is exhausted, you get the OutOfMemory exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What that Xmx512M option DOES NOT do, is limit the overall size of the process. It limits only the Java Heap part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you could have a contrived Java program that uses 10mb of Java heap, but calls a JNI call that allocates 500MB of C Heap. You can see how your process size is large, even though the Java heap is small. Also, with the new NIO libraries, you can attach memory outside of the heap as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other aspect that you must consider is that the Java GC is typically a "Copying Collector". Which means it takes the "live" data from memory it's collecting, and copies it to a different section of memory. This empty space that is copies to IS NOT PART OF THE HEAP, at least, not in terms of the Xmx parameter. It's, like, "the new Heap", and becomes part of the heap after the copy (the old space is used for the next GC). If you have a 512MB heap, and it's at 510MB, Java is going to copy the live data someplace. The naive thought would be to another large open space (like 500+MB). If all of your data were "live", then it would need a large chunk like that to copy into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you can see that in the most extreme edge case, you need at least double the free memory on your system to handle a specific heap size. At least 1GB for a 512MB heap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out that not the case in practice, and memory allocation and such is more complicated than that, but you do need a large chunk of free memory to handle the heap copies, and this impacts the overall process size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, note that the JVM does fun things like mapping in the rt.jar classes in to the VM to ease startup. They're mapped in a read only block, and can be shared across other Java processes. These shared pages will "count" against all Java processes, even though it is really only consuming physical memory once (the magic of virtual memory).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now as to why your process continues to grow, if you never hit the Java OOM message, that means that your leak is NOT in the Java heap, but that doesn't mean it may not be in something else (the JRE runtime, a 3rd party JNI librariy, a native JDBC driver, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

There's a couple of database programming architecture designs you should know of, and what their costs/benefits are.
2 Tier generally means you have a client connecting to a DB, issuing direct SQL calls.
3 Tier generally means you have an "application server" that is issuing direct SQL calls to the DB, but the client is talking to the app server.  Generally, this affords "scaling out".
Finally, you have 2 1/2 tiered apps that employ a 2 Tier like format, only the work is compartmentalized within  stored procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your process sounds like a "back office" kind of thing, and clients/processes just need results that are being aggregated and cached on a once a month basis.
That is, there is no agent that connects, and connects often, and says "do these calculations".  Instead you allude to a process that happens once in a while, and you can get away with non-real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, given those requirements, I'd say that generally, it will be faster to be closer to the data, and let SQL server do all the calculations.
I think you'll find that proximity to the data will serve you well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in performing these calculations, you may find that some calculations are not amenable to SQL Servers.  Take for example calculating the accrued interest of a bond, or any fixed income instrument.  Not very pretty in SQL, and much more suited for a richer programming language.  However, if you just have simple averages and other relatively sane aggregates, I'd stick to stored procedures, on the SQL side. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So again, there's not enough information as to the nature of your calculations, or what your house mandates in terms of SQL capabilities of devs for support, or what your boss says...but since I know my way around SQL, and like to stay close to the data, I'd stay pure SQL/Stored Procedures for a task like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YMMV :)&lt;/p&gt;

I played around (struggled) with it for a while and got it to a very basic level but then was too annoyed by the limitations I was encountering (which may well have been limitations of my knowledge) and when I read a blog suggesting to ditch XSLT and just write your own XML-to-whatever parser in your language of choice, I eagerly jumped onto that and it's worked out brilliantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm still working on it to this day (&lt;em&gt;I'm actually supposed to be working on it right now, instead of playing on SO&lt;/em&gt;), and I am seeing more and more things which make me think that the decision to ditch XSLT was a good one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that XSLT has its place, in that it is an accepted standard, and that if everyone is writing their own interpreters, 90% of them will end up on &lt;a href="http://thedailywtf.com"&gt;TheDailyWTF&lt;/a&gt;. But given that it is a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"&gt;functional style language&lt;/a&gt; instead of the procedural style which most programmers are familiar with, for someone embarking on a project such as my own, &lt;strong&gt;would you recommend they go down the path that I did, or stick it out with XSLT&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#define foreach(var, container) \
  for(typeof((container).begin()) var = (container).begin(); \
      var != (container).end(); \
      ++var)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note that 'typeof' is a gcc extension.) It is used like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;std::vector&amp;lt; Blorgus &amp;gt; blorgi = ...;
foreach(blorgus, blorgi) {
  blorgus-&amp;gt;draw();
}

&lt;p&gt;I would like to make something similar that iterates over a map's values. Call it "foreach_value", perhaps. So instead of writing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;foreach(pair, mymap) {
  pair-&amp;gt;second-&amp;gt;foo();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;foreach_value(v, mymap) {
  v.foo();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't come up with a macro that will do this, because it requires declaring two variables: the iterator and the value variable ('v', above). I don't know how to do that in the initializer of a for loop, even using gcc extensions. I could declare it just before the foreach_value call, but then it will conflict with other instances of the foreach_value macro in the same scope. If I could suffix the current line number to the iterator variable name, it would work, but I don't know how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Most applications do not require administrator privileges at run time. If your application doesn't maintain cross-session state while it executes and doesn't do something like modifying the local security policy, it should be just fine running with a standard-user token. Sometimes certain parts of your application will require administrator privileges, and you should separate out those pieces into a separate process. I'll get into that a little later. &lt;/p&gt;

On Win95/98/ME, it only worked on a Japanese OS, at least with IE, because of limitations in the Windows tooltip control in non-NT systems. (Regarding other answers which guide you to the title attribute: the same behavior applied with the title attribute).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it's possible that font linking/font mapping won't kick in if you haven't installed the language support, or if you've just copied some font to your fonts folder. It's also possible that your default font choice for tooltips doesn't support Japanese, though GDI font-linking fallback should kick in on Win2000 or above, unless the font lies about what it supports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "empty square" phenomenon is typically suggestive of a font mapping problem, though it's remotely possible that the encoding is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libraries written for public consumption are designed to be as generic as possible so that it is usable by the widest possible audience.  In C++, this is often best done using templates.  It would suck tremendously if found a good library, only to discover it was useless for your purposes because it used floats instead of doubles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CGAL, for example, appears to have adopted the well-known and well-tested STL paradigm of writing generic and extensible C++ libraries.  This does indeed make it difficult to follow with code analysis tools; I doubt they're much good at following STL headers either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But are you trying to use the library or modify it?  Either way, they seem to have some extremely high-quality documentation (e.g. &lt;a href="http://www.cgal.org/Manual/3.3/doc_html/cgal_manual/Kernel_23/Chapter_main.html"&gt;Kernel Manual&lt;/a&gt;) that should make it relatively simple to figure out what you need to do, without having to resort to reading their code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer:  I know this isn't what you're asking for.  But I don't think what you're looking for exists.  It is &lt;strong&gt;extraordinarily&lt;/strong&gt; rare to find open source code with documentation as good as what I've seen scanning through CGAL.  I would strongly suggest that you take another look at it.&lt;/p&gt;

Having said that, and I think a comparison can be drawn with regular expressions, it has it's uses when it comes to simple well defined problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the alternative approach and parsing XML in code can be equally nasty and you really want to employ some kind of XML marshalling/binding technology (such as JiBX in Java) that will convert your XML straight to an object.&lt;/p&gt;

The computer game that I was working on at the time used tons of UI pages defined using XML. During a major refactor shortly after a release we wanted to change the structure of these XML documents. We made the game's input format follow a much better and schema aware structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;XSLT seemed the perfect choice for this translation from old format -&gt; New format. Within two weeks I had a working conversion from old to new for our hundreds of pages. I was also able to use it to extract lots of information on the layout of our UI pages. I created lists of which components were imbedded in which relatively easily which I then used XSLT to write into our schema definitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, coming from a C++ background, it was a very fun and interesting language to master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that as a tool to translate XML from one format to another it is fantastic. However, it is not the only way to define an algorithm that takes XML as an input and outputs &lt;em&gt;Something&lt;/em&gt;. If your algorithm is sufficiently complex, the fact that the input is XML becomes irrelevant to your choice of tool - i.e roll your own in C++ / Python / whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific to your example, I would imagine the best idea would be to create your own XML-&gt;XML convert that follows your business logic. Next, write a XSLT translator that just knows about formatting and does nothing clever. That might be a nice middle ground but it totally depends what you are doing. Having a XSLT translator on the output makes it easier to create alternative output formats - printable, for mobiles, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Using integer primary keys in a URL is a security risk. It is quite easy for someone to post using any number. For example, through normal web application use, the user creates a user record with an ID of 45 (viewitem/id/45). This means the user automatically knows there are 44 other users. And unless you have a correct authorization system in place they can see the other user's information by created their own url (viewitem/id/32).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PhoneNumber is dumb and is only a dataset.  When the "dialling" happens, should the  the PhoneNumber object know how to dial?  There are many states to keep track of, like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the phone already on another call? (if yes/no, what to do?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens if the method of dialling changes? (global roaming, different carrier, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, what about scope?  When a call is made, the phone number needs to be added to the list of recent outgoing calls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your PhoneNumber object needs to know all this, it's not DRY and your code will be less
portable and more likely to break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say that Steven A. Lowe has it down.  This should be done by a Controller type object to handle the different states, etc.  Keep your PhoneNumber object dumb and give the smarts to the middle-man who needs to worry about keeping the phone humming along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for instance say you had an online store that sold stuff from 2 merchants.  Merchant A had items (1, 3, 5, 7) and Merchant B has items (2, 4, 5, 8).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I am shopping on Merchant A's site and see:
&lt;a href="http://server/viewitem.aspx?id=1" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://server/viewitem.aspx?id=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That might let me access an item that I shouldn't be accessing since I am shopping with Merchant A and not B. In general allowing users to fiddle with stuff like that can lead to security problems.  Another brief example is employees that can look at their personal information (id=382) but they type in someone else id to go directly to someone else profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, having said that.. this is not bad as long as security checks are built into the system that check to make sure people are doing what they are supposed to (ex: not shopping with another merchant or not viewing another employee).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One mechanism is to store information in sessions, but some do not like that.  I am not a web programmer so I will not go into that :)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current project requires me to do different things based on different HTTP request headers for nearly every action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, I have one massive Controller (all for the same resource type), and every action method has an ActionName attribute (so that I can have multiple versions of the same action that takes the same parameters, but does different things) and a custom FilterAttribute (implemented almost exactly like the AcceptVerbsAttribute in Preview 5) that checks if certain headers have certain values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would really like to push the code into separate Controllers, and have the RouteTable select between them based on the headers, but can't think of the cleanest way to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Example&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, say I have a list of files.  The service must process the request in one of two ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The client wants a zip file, and passes "accept: application/zip" as a header, I take the list of files, pack them into a zip file, and send it back to the client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The client wants an html page, so it passes "accept: text/html", the site sends back a table-formatted html page listing the files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Another great microcontroller manufacturer is Dallas Semiconductor &lt;a href="http://www.maxim-ic.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.maxim-ic.com/&lt;/a&gt; and they also ship out free samples too.  Dallas/Maxim also has an Engineering Journal that they will mail free to your address and the journal has tons of sample implementations, using their chips of course, from which you can grok lots of good information from as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Any information that gives away your data structure is more information that a hacker can use to access your database.  As mopoke says, you also expose yourself to SQL injection attacks which are fairly common and can be extremely harmful to your database and application.  From a privacy standpoint, if you are displaying any information that is sensitive or personal, anybody can just substitute a number to retrieve information and if you have no mechanism for authentication, you could be putting your information at risk.  Also, if it's that easy to query your database, you open yourself up to Denial of Service attacks with someone just looping through URL's against your server since they know each one will get a response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the nature of the data, I tend to recommend against sharing anything in the URL that could give away anything about your application's architecture, it seems to me you are just inviting trouble (I feel the same way about hidden fields which aren't really hidden).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get around it, we usaully encrypt the parameters before passing them.  In some cases, the encyrpted URL also includes some form of verification/authentication mechanism so the server can decide if it's ok to process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course every application is different and the level of security you want to implement has to be balanced with functionality, budget, performance, etc.  But I don't see anything wrong with being paranoid when it comes to data security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had experience working on a system somewhat similar to the one you describe. My company noted that the data we were returning from "the middle tier" was in XML, and that the pages were to be rendered in HTML which might as well be XHTML, plus they'd heard that XSL was a standard for transforming between XML formats. So the "architects" (by which I mean people who think deep design thoughts but apparently never code) decided that our front tier would be implemented by writing XSLT scripts that transformed the data into the XHTML for display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choice turned out to be disastrous. XSLT, it turns out, is a pain to write. And so all of our pages were difficult to write and to maintain. We would have done much better to have used JSP (this was in Java) or some similar approach that used one kind of markup (angle brackets) for the output format (the HTML) and another kind of markup (like &amp;lt;%...%&gt;) for the meta-data. The most confusing thing about XSLT is that it is written in XML, and it translates from XML to XML... it is quite difficult to keep all 3 different XML documents straight in one's mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your situation is slightly different: instead of authoring each page in XSLT as I did, you only need to write ONE bit of code in XSLT (the code to convert from templates to display). But it sounds like you may have run into the same kind of difficulty that I did.  I would say that trying to interpret a simple XML-based DSL (domain specific language) like you are doing is NOT one of the strong points of XSLT. (Although it CAN do the job... after all, it IS Turing complete!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if what you had was simpler: you have data in one XML format and wanted to make simple alterations to it -- not a full page-description DSL, but some simple straightforward modifications, then XSLT is an excellent tool for that purpose. It's declarative (not procedural) nature is actually an advantage for that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, using Attributes for the mappings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I have this working mapping the collection as type Int32 and NH seems to take care of it, but it's not exactly ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The error I receive is "Unable to determine type" when trying to map the collection as of the type of the enum I am trying to map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found a post that said to define a class as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class CEnumType : EnumStringType {
  public CEnumType() : base(MyEnum) { }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then map the enum as CEnumType, but this gives "CEnumType is not mapped" or something similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So has anyone got experience doing this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So anyway, just a simple reference code snippet to give an example with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    [NHibernate.Mapping.Attributes.Class(Table = "OurClass")]
    public class CClass : CBaseObject
    {
        public enum EAction
        {
            do_action,
            do_other_action
        };

        private IList&amp;lt;EAction&amp;gt; m_class_actions = new List&amp;lt;EAction&amp;gt;();

        [NHibernate.Mapping.Attributes.Bag(0, Table = "ClassActions", Cascade="all", Fetch = CollectionFetchMode.Select, Lazy = false)]
        [NHibernate.Mapping.Attributes.Key(1, Column = "Class_ID")]
        [NHibernate.Mapping.Attributes.Element(2, Column = "EAction", Type = "Int32")]
        public virtual IList&amp;lt;EAction&amp;gt; Actions
        {
            get { return m_class_actions; }
            set { m_class_actions = value;}
        }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, anyone got the correct attributes for me to map this collection of enums as actual enums? It would be really nice if they were stored in the db as strings instead of ints too but it's not completely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

It would make sense to have a nested class if you want to hide it more in the namespace of the outer class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;You probably don't want to do this. Using &lt;code&gt;git describe&lt;/code&gt; is a reasonable alternative.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note it uses x264 assembly syntax, which makes it more portable (to 32-bit vs 64-bit, etc).  To convert this into the syntax of your choice is trivial: r0, r1, r2 are the three arguments to the functions in registers.  Its a bit like pseudocode.  Or you can just get common/x86/x86inc.asm from the x264 tree and include that to run it natively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Sometimes-connected application wanting to have a read-only cache: Sync Services&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you just want a SQL CE database and you're working with a SQL 2008 server then the wizard in Visual Studio 2008 SP1 will do all the work for you, you need only add 1 line of code to it if you want bi-directional support. If you can't upgrade then it will take more work with SQL 2005, and it's only reliable if you have at least SP2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm in the middle of a project that requires multiple sites to have a sub-set of data in an environment where each site may lose it's connection to the head office at times, we've managed to get Sync Services to work with SQL 2008 at the head office and SQL Express 2008 at each site with full change tracking (2008 feature) and it's working great. It does require a reasonable amount of code (C# and SQL), so we've used some pretty smart templates to help. Be aware that.&lt;/p&gt;

I work on a project where we originally stored all of our data using XML, then moved to sqlite.  There are many pros and cons to each technology, but it was performance that caused the switchover.  Here is what we observed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For small databases (a few meg or smaller), XML was much faster, and easier to deal with.  Our data was naturally in a tree format, which made XML much more attractive, and XPATH allowed us to do many queries in one simple line rather than having to walk down an ancestry tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were programming in a Win32 environment, and used the standard Microsoft DOM library.  We would load all the data into memory, parse it into a dom tree and search, add, modify on the in memory copy.  We would periodically save the data, and needed to rotate copies in case the machine crashed in the middle of a write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also needed to build up some "indexes" by hand using C++ tree maps.  This, of course would be trivial to do with sql.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the size of the data on the filesystem was a factor of 2-4 smaller than the "in memory" dom tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time the data got to 10M-100M size, we started to have real problems.  Interestingly enough, at all data sizes, XML processing was much faster than sqlite turned out to be (because it was in memory, not on the hard drive)!  The problem was actually twofold- first, loadup time really started to get long.  We would need to wait a minute or so before the data was in memory and the maps were built.  Of course once loaded the program was very fast.  The second problem was that all of this memory was tied up all the time.  Systems with only a few hundred meg would be unresponsive in other apps even though we ran very fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We actually looking into using a filesystem based xml database.  There are a couple open sourced versions xml databases, we tried them.  I have never tried to use a commercial xml database, so I can't comment on them.  Unfortunately, we could never get the xml databases to work well at all.  Even the act of populating the database with hundreds of meg of xml took hours....  Perhaps we were using it incorrectly.  Another problem was that these databases were pretty heavyweight.  They required java and had full client server architecture.  We gave up on this idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found sqlite then.  It solved our problems, but at a price.  When we initially plugged sqlite in, the memory and load time problems were gone.  Unfortunately, since all processing was now done on the harddrive, the background processing load went way up.  While earlier we never even noticed the CPU load, now the processor usage was way up.  We needed to optimize the code, and still needed to keep some data in memory.  We also needed to rewrite many simple XPATH queries as complicated multiquery algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here is a summary of what we learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For tree data, XML is much easier to query and modify using XPATH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For small datasets (less than 10M), XML blew away sqlite in performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For large datasets (greater than 10M-100M), XML load time and memory usage became a big problem, to the point that some computers become unusable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We couldn't get any opensource xml database to fix the problems associated with large datasets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;SQLITE doesn't have the memory problems of XML dom, but it is generally slower in processing the data (it is on the hard drive, not in memory).    (note- sqlite tables can be stored in memory, perhaps this would make it as fast....  We didn't try this because we wanted to get the data out of memory.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storing and querying tree data in a table is not enjoyable.  However, managing transactions and indexing partially makes up for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domain-specific to XML, so for example no need to quote literal XML in the output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports XPath/XQuery, which can be a nice way to query DOMs, in the same way that regular expressions can be a nice way to query strings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Functional language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disadvantages of XSLT:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be obscenely verbose - you don't have to quote literal XML, which effectively means you do have to quote code. And not in a pretty way. But then again, it's not much worse than your typical SSI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doesn't do certain things which most programmers take for granted. For instance string manipulation can be a chore. This can lead to "unfortunate moments" when novices design code, then frantically search the web for hints how to implement functions they assumed would just be there and didn't give themselves time to write.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Functional language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to get procedural behaviour, by the way, is to chain multiple transforms together. After each step you have a brand new DOM to work on which reflects the changes in that step. Some XSL processors have extensions to effectively do this in one transform, but I forget the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if your code is mostly output and not much logic, XSLT can be a very neat way to express it. If there is a lot of logic, but mostly of forms which are built in to XSLT (select all elements which look like blah, and for each one output blah), it's likely to be quite a friendly environment. If you fancy thinking XML-ishly at all times, then give XSLT 2 a go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, I'd say that if your favourite programming language has a good DOM implementation supporting XPath and allowing you to build documents in a useful way, then there are few benefits to using XSLT. Bindings to libxml2 and gdome2 should do nicely, and there's no shame in sticking to general-purpose languages you know well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home-grown XML parsers are usually either incomplete (in which case you'll come unstuck some day) or else not much smaller than something you could have got off the shelf (in which case you're probably wasting your time), and give you any number of opportunities to introduce severe security issues around malicious input. Don't write one unless you know exactly what you gain by doing it. Which is not to say you can't write a parser for something simpler than XML as your input format, if you don't need everything that XML offers.&lt;/p&gt;

What are the alternatives. There has to be something in the URL that uniquely defines what you want to display to the user.

This is a little trickier to code, as all links need to be form submits.  Also, it's only minimally harder for users of the site to put in whatever value they wish.  Also this wouldn't allow the user to bookmark anything, which is a major disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe there are so many similarities between MDSD, Software Production Lines and DSL's in general that this 'new' way of doing things needs to clean up it's concepts.
That's one of the reasons why it's hard to find good information about the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On another note, acm.org has an extensive digital library of research articles, articles from various conferences (such as OOPSLA), where you can find much information about DSL's, language designs, SPL, MDSD, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;

You have several brands, each one sporting a full range of controllers, with varying degrees of capacity, complexity and ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the way to start with most microcontrollers is by reading the manufacturers' manual. As opposed to "normal" programming, where most programmers go by standards and rules and best practices and frameworks, etc. microcontroller programming is still done pretty much as programming was done in the early 1980s: by reading a controller's manual, reproducing examples, and extending from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microchip's &lt;a href="http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;amp;nodeId=84"&gt;manuals&lt;/a&gt;, for example, are excellent. They also have a very good &lt;a href="http://forum.microchip.com/"&gt;community&lt;/a&gt;, and provide some libraries with "standard" functions you might like to use (like math, I/O, doing serial I/O using two pins, and so on). A lot of the people working with PICs is quite open and normally share their source code if they think it might be of use to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some choices you have to make before beginning. The first one is what language are you going to use. You have three options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assembly: Most manufacturers provide free or quite cheap development kits for their microcontrollers (MCUs for short). This is the most powerful option, and the one you should use if you feel comfortable. It also will teach you &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt; about computers in general.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something else: If you'd rather use something like C, you'll have to pay quite a bit of money for the compiler (although there is at least &lt;a href="http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/"&gt;one open source option&lt;/a&gt; for some of the device), and you have to consider the code produced by the high-level languages normally takes a lot of space/memory in the device. Also, depending on the standard library, you'll end up programming a fair amount of the functionality yourself anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic/Pascal-like language: some MCUs come with an Basic/Pascal-like interpreter. These are great to start doing some "toy" projects, and getting the feeling of how this things work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, you have to decide what kind of device you want to use. Prices per unit vary greatly depending on maker, whether it is PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, how much memory it has, how much storage it has, how many programmable pins, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My recommendation, for starters, would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to find a free "burner" on the Internet if you want to experience the thrill of programming your MCUs using something &lt;em&gt;you built&lt;/em&gt;. There are plenty available out there, just google for "simple PIC burner" or similar. If that's not a requirement, then you can buy a burner, but it will cost you a fair bit of money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; EEPROM version of the MCU you think you are going to use the most. This will save you the problem of having to throw away a $5 piece of hardware just because you have a bug in your code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy a bunch of the PROM version of the MCU. They are cheap, and you'll need them. And once you get started, you'll want to put an MCU &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn how to use The Emulator. Most SDKs come with an emulator you can use to test your ideas before committing them to PROM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find yourself some simple and interesting first project. I must emphasize the &lt;strong&gt;SIMPLE&lt;/strong&gt; there. If you try to come up with a way to control your microwave oven using a remote control straight away, be ready for a long period of learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, hope this helps you! If you want any more information, I'm around the corner, just whistle! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common scenario I have seen is to use a single SQL account with the permissions set to what is required by the application.  This account is used by all application calls.  Then when people require access over the database via query tools or such a separate Group is created with the query access and people are given access to that group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other scenario I have seen is to use complete Windows Authentication End to End.  So the users themselves are added to groups which have all the permissions set so the user is able to update and change outside the parameters of the application.  This normally involves securing people down to the appropriate stored procedures so they aren't updating the tables directly.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first scenario seems relatively easily to maintain but raises concerns if there is a security hole in the application then the whole database is compromised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second scenario seems more secure but has the opposite concern of having to much business logic in stored procedures on the database.  This seems to limit the use of the some really cool technologies like Nhibernate and LINQ.  However in this day and age where people can use data in so many different ways we don't foresee e.g. mash-ups etc is this the best approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by setting to yourself a goal to achieve (for example - implementing a particles system.  this includes usage of blending modes, textures, vertex colors, batching and transformations), and then go and start with the simplest element - drawing and rotating a quad.  From there go on and add textures, add more quads, etc...
While doing that you'd need some info about the syntax - this you can find in many books, but the best (very boring) source is the specification committee publication that can be found here: &lt;a href="http://www.khronos.org/opengles/spec/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.khronos.org/opengles/spec/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

       rem do stuff

&lt;p&gt;One error I get is "Type Mismatch" calling MyMessageHandler where VB complains that Item is not a MailItem. Okay, but TypeName(Item) returns "MailItem", so how come Item is not a MailItem?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another one I get is where an email with an empty subject comes along. The line&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;strSubject = Item.Subject
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;ID and NAME tokens must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods (".").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#the-id-attribute"&gt;HTML 5&lt;/a&gt; is even more permissive, saying only that an id must contain at least one character and may not contain any space characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as a practical matter, you will be somewhat more limited if you want your documents to work with a variety of browsers, CSS editors, and JavaScript frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in other responses, jQuery has problems with ids that contain periods and colons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more subtle problem is that some browsers treat id attribute values as case-sensitive, while other browsers do not. That means that if you type &lt;code&gt;id="firstName"&lt;/code&gt; in your HTML (lower-case 'f') and &lt;code&gt;#FirstName { color: red }&lt;/code&gt; in your CSS (upper-case 'F'), a buggy browser will set the element's color to red. Because both definitions use valid characters for the id, you will receive no error from a validation tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can avoid these problems by strictly sticking to a naming convention. For example, if you limit yourself entirely to lower-case characters and always separate words with either hyphens or underscores (but not both, pick one and never use the other), then you have an easy-to-remember pattern. You will never wonder "was it &lt;code&gt;firstName&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;FirstName&lt;/code&gt;?" because you will always know that you should type &lt;code&gt;first_name&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In detail:  As someone who has spent a lot of time programming in Windows, one of the larger stumbling blocks I've found whenever I have to code C++ in Linux is that debugging anything using commandline gdb takes me several times longer than it does in Visual Studio, and it does not seem to be getting better with practice.  Some things are just easier or faster to express graphically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, I'm looking for a GUI that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handles all the basics like stepping over &amp;amp; into code, watch variables and breakpoints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understands and can display the contents of complex &amp;amp; nested C++ data types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doesn't get confused by and preferably can intelligently step through templated code and data structures while displaying relevant information such as the parameter types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can handle threaded applications and switch between different threads to step through or view the state of&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can handle attaching to an already-started process or reading a core dump, in addition to starting the program up in gdb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If such a program does not exist, then I'd like to hear about experiences people have had with programs that meet at least some of the bullet points.
Does anyone have any recommendations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Listing out the possibilities is great, and I'll take what I can get, but it would be even more helpful if you could include in your responses:&lt;br&gt;
(a) Whether or not you've actually used this GUI and if so, what positive/negative feedback you have about it.&lt;br&gt;
(b) If you know, which of the above-mentioned features are/aren't supported&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lists are easy to come by, sites like this are great because you can get an idea of people's personal experiences with applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So, the use-case I was thinking of was, you had mentioned that in the Windows Media Player, you can play things faster when you're listening to podcasts and so forth, and it'll speed them up.  And when I looked in there, that was disabled.  And I couldn't figure out how to enable it.  And obviously the help file is no help--not that anybody reads help files, but even if you did you couldn't find the answer to that.  And that was kind of frustrating, and I'd rather have that menu item be enabled and have it just tell me "I'm not going to do this right now because of the following reason.  I refuse to do this."  &lt;/p&gt;

The first declares the iterator, with a name which is a function of the container variable (and you can make this uglier if you're worried about conflicts with your own code).  The second declares the value variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#define ci(container) container ## iter
#define foreach_value(var, container) \
    for (typeof((container).begin()) ci(container) = container.begin(); \

&lt;p&gt;By using the same loop termination condition, the outer loop only happens once (and if you're lucky, gets optimized away).  Also, you avoid calling -&gt;second on the iterator if the map is empty.  That's the same reason for the ternary operator in the increment of the inner loop; at the end, we just leave var at the last value, since it won't be referenced again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could inline ci(container), but I think it makes the macro more readable.&lt;/p&gt;

It depends on the problem domain, the type of user, how critical the function is and so on. There is no single answer to your question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the general consensus is, never ever totally remove items from a menu. Menus allow the user to freely discover what functions are available, but if those items are hidden or move around it does nothing to help the user. Also, moving them around makes it impossible to become proficient with the application since you have to constantly scan the menus for the item you want to select.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for disabling versus enabling an item and displaying a dialog or message explaining why it's not something you can do, I generally prefer the former. However, if there's a function that a user can't reasonably be expected to intuit from the display, leaving it enabled is a good choice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if "Paste" is disabled it's reasonably obvious to most computer users that there's nothing to paste. However, if you have a "Frizzle the Bonfraz" menu item and the user may not know what a Bonfraz is or why they might want to enable it but can't, it's a good idea to leave it enabled at least for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So again, it depends. If at all possible, do what you think is best and then ask your users. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect that one of the reasons for Vista not being an outstanding success was that it ran much slower than XP, and, because computers had not improved as greatly in speed as in the past, this change seemed like a step backwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years CPU speed outstripped the speed of software so new frameworks that added layers of OS obfuscation and bloat did little harm.  Just imagine how fast Windows 95 would run on today's hardware (given a few memory tweaks).  Win2K then WinXP were great improvements, and we could live with them being slower because of faster computers.&lt;/p&gt;

Since the proliferation of these frameworks like .Net and others can only have made this situation worse, is it possible that we might discover that being able to write code in 'C' directly to the Win32 API (or the equivalent in other OS's) will become a strong competitive advantage, even if it does take longer to write?  Or will the trade off in longer development time just not ever be worth it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly you need to track changes, if you can use SQL 2008 (even the Express version is enough if the 2Gb limit isn't a problem) this will ease the pain greatly, just turn on Change Tracking on the database and each table. We're using SQL Server 2008 at the head office with the extended schema and SQL Express 2008 at each site with a sub-set of data and limited schema.&lt;/p&gt;

In this example you will need to use the &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sync/archive/2008/06/24/sample-sql-express-client-synchronization-using-sync-services-for-ado-net.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sync using SQL Express Client&lt;/a&gt; sample as a starting point, note that it's based on SQL 2005 so you'll need to update it to take advantage of the Change Tracking features in 2008. By default the Sync Services uses SQL CE on the clients, which I'm sure isn't enough in your case. You'll need a service that runs on your Web Server that periodically (could be as often as every 10 seconds if you want) runs the Synchronize() method. This will tell your main database about changes made locally and then ask the server for all changes made there. You can set up the get and apply SQL code to call stored procedures and you can add event handlers to handle conflicts (e.g. Client Update vs Server Update) and resolve them accordingly at each end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I start a process with &lt;code&gt;System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(..)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The process opens a splash screen -- this splash screen becomes the main window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The splash screen closes and the 'real' UI is shown.  The main window (splash screen) is now invalid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I still have the Process object, and I can query its handle, module, etc.  But the main window handle is now invalid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to get the process's UI (or UI handle) at this point.  Assume I cannot change the behavior of the process to make this any easier (or saner).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have looked around online but I'll admit I didn't look for more than an hour.  Seemed like it should be somewhat trivial :-(&lt;/p&gt;

I noticed that copying to and from the device was really hurting my overall performance, so now I am trying to move a large amount of data onto the device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this data is used in numerous functions, I would like it to be global. Yes, I can pass pointers around, but I would really like to know how to work with globals in this instance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I have device functions that want to access a device allocated array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, I could do something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;__device__ float* global_data;

main()
{
  cudaMalloc(global_data);
  kernel1&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;blah&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;(blah); //access global data
  kernel2&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;blah&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;(blah); //access global data again
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I havent figured out how to create a dynamic array. I figured out a work around by declaring the array as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;__device__ float global_data[REALLY_LARGE_NUMBER];
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while that doesn't require a cudaMalloc call, I would prefer the dynamic allocation approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;*Sphinx - good reputation for speed and functionality but Sphinx needs integer keys and my model uses GUID; ThinkingSphinx recently announced support for GeoSpatial &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Acts_As_Ferret - looks easy to use, but lots of detractors that say its unstable&lt;/li&gt;

You encrypt something with your private key, but since the public key is public, anyone can decrypt it. The  algorithms that do this are called "asymmetric ciphers" (since the encryption key is different than the decryption key).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, a (cryptographically secure) hash of the data is computed and only that hash is signed. This saves the computational effort of encrypting the entire message, and makes the message still readable in clear text which could be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be concrete, the RSA algorithm will do what you want in a secure way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do yourself a favour and do not try to implement it yourself; rather, take an existing implementation like the one from the OpenSSL library. It has an Apache-style license so you're probably allowed to use it in your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(However, note that such a licensing system is never completely secure: somebody can still modify your executable and remove the check. But clearly that is more effort than, say, simply modifying a registry value.)&lt;/p&gt;

        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(value)) return defaultValue;

&lt;p&gt;The first interesting thing that I realized is that Visual Studio does not automatically generate the ProfileCommon proxy class for you.  That's not a big deal since it's simpy a matter of extending the ProfileBase class.  After creating a ProfileCommon class, I wrote the following Action method for creating the user profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[AcceptVerbs("POST")]
public ActionResult CreateProfile(string company, string phone, string fax, string city, string state, string zip)
{
    MembershipUser user = Membership.GetUser();
    ProfileCommon profile = ProfileCommon.Create(user.UserName, user.IsApproved) as ProfileCommon;

    profile.Company = company;
    profile.Phone = phone;
    profile.Fax = fax;
    profile.City = city;
    profile.State = state;
    profile.Zip = zip;
    profile.Save();

    return RedirectToAction("Index", "Account"); 
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem that I'm having is that the call to ProfileCommon.Create() cannot cast to type ProfileCommon, so I'm not able to get back my profile object, which obviously causes the next line to fail since profile is null.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following is a snippet of my web.config:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;profile defaultProvider="AspNetSqlProfileProvider" automaticSaveEnabled="false" enabled="true"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;providers&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;clear/&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;add name="AspNetSqlProfileProvider" type="System.Web.Profile.SqlProfileProvider, System.Web, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a" connectionStringName="ApplicationServices" applicationName="/" /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/providers&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;properties&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;add name="FirstName" type="string" /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;add name="LastName" type="string" /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;add name="Company" type="string" /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;add name="Phone" type="string" /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;add name="Fax" type="string" /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;add name="City" type="string" /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;add name="State" type="string" /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;add name="Zip" type="string" /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;add name="Email" type="string" &amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/properties&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/profile&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Boost::Gil framework that handles pixels is a nice template-based system that boils down to many inlined functions - the compiler creates the same output as it would if you had no wrapper for the pixels and accessed the values directly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So - as for your question, I think the ball is in the court of the framework writers to ensure that their frameworks are fast and lean. This might mean that they detect which features are in use and remove code relating to unused features.&lt;/p&gt;

Take delegates for example: Many very simple C# applications use delegates, while the Java folks figures that the observer pattern was sufficient.  So, in order for a tool to convert a C# application which uses delegates it would have to translate the structure from using delegates to an implementation of the observer pattern.
Another problem is the fact that C# methods are not virtual by default while Java methods are.  Additionally, Java doesn't have a way to make methods non virtual.  This creates another problem: an application in C# could leverage non virtual method behavior through polymorphism in a way the does not translate directly to Java.
If you look around you will probably find that there are lots of tools to convert Java to C# since it is a simpler language (please don't flame me I didn't say worse I said simpler); however, you will find very few if any decent tools that convert C# to Java.&lt;/p&gt;

One thing that I've found that works well is to throw one away, but choose your technology well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I've written a large codebase in Ruby on Rails, and over the past 2-3 years, RoR has advanced a lot.  I also made some decisions in architecture that needed to be fixed.  So, I'm throwing one away, and building a new one from scratch.  However, I'm still able to use 70-80% or so of my old code as I'm still writing in Ruby and Rails.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major factor that has helped with that is that Rails forces you to write well structured code with separation of business logic and presentation layers.  I didn't get it perfect the first time around, but since everything is fairly well separated and DRY, porting the code to Rails v2.1, re-architecting the problem areas, and re-writing some "problem" features has been a fairly pain free experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, by choosing a great technology from the start, I've been able to throw one away, but still take with me 70-80% of the old stuff that still works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To find yourself on an island with no boat or bridge in site. Of course, you could talk to the villager in town and he would tell you the magical word to make a bridge appear...but you had no idea that magic existed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You see that there is a bridge; however, when you get to it, there is a sign telling you that the bridge is not open to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You see that there is a bridge and celebrate! When you get to the end of the bridge, it tells you that the exit is not open. They must go back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I am biased, but I don't believe that leaving the menu options enabled and allowing the user to click on it is the best of idea. That's just wasting someone's time. There is no way for them to distinguish that the item is available or not until they click on the item. (Scenario #3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiding the item all together has its pros and cons. Completely hidden and you run the risk of the user never discovering all these features; however, at the same time, you are presented with the opportunity of making your application 'fun' and 'discoverable.' I've always thought the visibility of actions is more suited to items like toolbars. A good example of that is in when in some applications the picture toolbar pops up when you click on an image...and disappears when you click on text. In general, I would say that something like this is best if the overall experience of your application lends towards a "discovering" and "exploring" attitude from the user. (Scenario #1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would generally recommend disabling the items and providing a tooltip to the user informing them how to enable it (or even a link to Help?); however, this cannot be overdone. This must be done in moderation. (Scenario #2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, when it's a context-related action (i.e. picture toolbar) that the user can easily discover, hide the items. If the user won't easily find it, have it disabled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/*
**  Bit set, clear, and test operations

**  public domain snippet by Bob Stout

typedef enum {ERROR = -1, FALSE, TRUE} LOGICAL;

#define BOOL(x) (!(!(x)))

#define BitSet(arg,posn) ((arg) | (1L &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (posn)))
#define BitClr(arg,posn) ((arg) &amp;amp; ~(1L &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (posn)))
#define BitTst(arg,posn) BOOL((arg) &amp;amp; (1L &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (posn)))
#define BitFlp(arg,posn) ((arg) ^ (1L &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (posn)))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, let's analyze things...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The common expression in all of these that you seem to be having problems
with is "(1L &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (posn))". All this does is create a mask with a single bit on
and which will work with any integer type. The "posn" argument specifies the
position where you want the bit. If posn==0, then this expression will
evaluate to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001 binary.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If posn==8, it will evaluate to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001 0000 0000 binary.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, it simply creates a field of 0's with a 1 at the specified
position. The only tricky part is in the BitClr() macro where we need to set
a single 0 bit in a field of 1's. This is accomplished by using the 1's
complement of the same expression as denoted by the tilde (~) operator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the mask is created it's applied to the argument just as you suggest,
by use of the bitwise and (&amp;amp;), or (|), and xor (^) operators. Since the mask
is of type long, the macros will work just as well on char's, short's, int's,
or long's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that this is a general solution to an entire class of
problems. It is, of course, possible and even appropriate to rewrite the
equivalent of any of these macros with explicit mask values every time you
need one, but why do it? Remember, the macro substitution occurs in the
preprocessor and so the generated code will reflect the fact that the values
are considered constant by the compiler - i.e. it's just as efficient to use
the generalized macros as to "reinvent the wheel" every time you need to do
bit manipulation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unconvinced? Here's some test code - I used Watcom C with full optimization
and without using _cdecl so the resulting disassembly would be as clean as
possible:&lt;/p&gt;

#define BitTst(arg,posn) BOOL((arg) &amp;amp; (1L &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (posn)))
#define BitFlp(arg,posn) ((arg) ^ (1L &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (posn)))

int bitmanip(int word)
{
      word = BitSet(word, 2);
      word = BitSet(word, 7);
      word = BitClr(word, 3);
      word = BitFlp(word, 9);
      return word;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally saw this happen in real life; we assigned a version 1 of the project as a quick throw-away to a mediocre programmer, because "we plan to throw it away later -- we will anyhow."

&lt;p&gt;I think when Brooks says "plan to throw one away, you will anyway" it's more like the statement "the number of bugs remaining to be found is 'n+1'."  That is, it's a ha-ha-only-serious statement about Murphy's law, rather than practical advice.  The lessons to take away from it is that prototypes are valuable, good writing is rewriting, and don't be afraid to abandon something that isn't working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it has to come down to a judgement call because as Joel Spolsky has talked about in several essays, the option to throw away and start over is tempting because code is easier to write than to read, and more fun to write than to maintain, so your natural inclination will always be to start over even when that isn't really the best thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with check that methods are called in a certain order is that your code is going to have to change, and you don't want to have to update your tests when that happens.  You should focus on testing the &lt;em&gt;actual requirement&lt;/em&gt; instead of testing the implementation detail that meets that requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, if you really want to test that your methods are called in a certain order, you'll need to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move them to another class, call it Collaborator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add an instance of this other class to the ToBeTested class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a mocking framework to set the instance variable on ToBeTested to be a mock of the Collborator class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call the method under test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use your mocking framework to assert that the methods were called on your mock in the correct order.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are your developers willing (preferably, EAGER) to spend the time it takes to learn to use WPF effectively?  I never would have thought to say this about MFC, or Windows Forms, or even unmanaged DirectX, but you probably do NOT want a team trying to "pick up" WPF over the course of a normal dev. cycle for a shipping product!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do at least one or two of your developers have some design sensibilities, and do individuals with final design authority have a decent understanding of development issues, so you can leverage WPF capabilities to create something which is actually BETTER, instead of just more "colorful", featuring gratuitous animation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does some percentage of your target customer base run on integrated graphics chip sets that might not support the features you were planning -- or are they still running Windows 2000, which would eliminate them as customers altogether?  Some people would also ask whether your customers actually CARE about enhanced visuals but, having lived through internal company "Our business customers don't care about colors and pictures" debates in the early 1990s, I know that well-designed solutions from your competitors will MAKE them care, and the real question is whether the conditions are right, to enable you to offer something that will make them care NOW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the project involve grounds-up development, at least for the presentation layer, to avoid the additional complexity of trying to hook into incompatible legacy scaffolding (Interoperability with Windows Forms is NOT seamless)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can your manager accept (or be distracted from noticing) a significant DROP in developer productivity for four to six months?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last issue is due to what I like to think of as the "FizzBin" nature of WPF, with ten different ways to implement any task, and no apparent reason to prefer one approach to another, and little guidance available to help you make a choice.  Not only will the shortcomings of whatever choice you make become clear only much later in the project, but you are virtually guaranteed to have every developer on your project adopting a different approach, resulting in a major maintenance headache.  Most frustrating of all are the inconsistencies that constantly trip you up, as you try to learn the framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;what level of code you want to have run after the exception candidate occurs - that is, how many layers of the call stack should unwind. You generally want to handle an exception as close as possible to where it occurs. For username/password validation, you would normally handle failures in the same block of code, rather than letting an exception bubble up. So an exception is probably not appropriate. (OTOH, after three failed login attempts, control flow may shift elsewhere, and an exception may be appropriate here.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this event something you would want to see in an error log? Not every exception is written to an error log, but it's useful to ask whether this entry in an error log would be useful - i.e., you would try to do something about it, or would be the garbage you ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can hook up a softphone to it initially while you're experimenting, and then later upgrade to a hardware VoIP phone like the Linksys SPA941.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll need a decent uplink connection and QoS, so it's not all simple fun and games, but dealing with PSTN I've found to be more trouble than hooking directly to a VoIP provider over the Net.

Immediately after that you should choose a medium size project as there may be issues with migrating a larger project (say with branches) that might not be apparent on a small project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you spend a bit of time seeing how easy it is to convert cvs projects to vss, or the other way around.

&lt;p&gt;As a result, recent graduates take many frameworks for granted (unless they have enough interest to find out for themselves what happens 'under the hood'). Self-taught developers would also more than likely go for stuff that is easier to learn and easier to use. Again, this is notwithstanding the folks who are really keen and take the trouble to learn what happens behind the scenes of any framework that they use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I agree with a previous post, it'll probably be down to the writers of the framework to come up with creative ways to ensure that their stuff runs efficiently.

Having to move away from frameworks would not be easy for many people, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arguments are (in order):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An input iterator designating the beginning of a container &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An input iterator designating the end of the container&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the Programming Guide:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;float* devPtr;
cudaMalloc((void**)&amp;amp;devPtr, 256 * sizeof(*devPtr));
cudaMemset(devPtr, 0, 256 * sizeof(*devPtr));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's a simple example of how to allocate memory.  Now, in your kernels, you should accept a pointer to a float like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;__global__
void kernel1(float *some_neat_data)
{
    some_neat_data[threadIdx.x]++;
}

__global__
void kernel2(float *potentially_that_same_neat_data)
{
    potentially_that_same_neat_data[threadIdx.x] *= 0.3f;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now you can invoke them like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;float* devPtr;
cudaMalloc((void**)&amp;amp;devPtr, 256 * sizeof(*devPtr));
cudaMemset(devPtr, 0, 256 * sizeof(*devPtr));

kernel1&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;1,128&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;(devPtr);
kernel2&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;1,128&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;(devPtr);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As this data is used in numerous
  functions, I would like it to be
  global.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are few good reasons to use globals.  This definitely is not one.  I'll leave it as an exercise to expand this example to include moving "devPtr" to a global scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, the fundamental problem is this: your kernels can only access device memory and the only global-scope pointers that they can use are GPU ones.  When calling a kernel from your CPU, behind the scenes what happens is that the pointers and primitives get copied into GPU registers and/or shared memory before the kernel gets executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the closest I can suggest is this: use cudaMemcpyToSymbol() to achieve your goals.  But, in the background, consider that a different approach might be the Right Thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;algorithm&amp;gt;

__constant__ float devPtr[1024];

__global__
void kernel1(float *some_neat_data)
{
    some_neat_data[threadIdx.x] = devPtr[0] * devPtr[1];
}

__global__
void kernel2(float *potentially_that_same_neat_data)
{
    potentially_that_same_neat_data[threadIdx.x] *= devPtr[2];
}


int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    float some_data[256];
    for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; sizeof(some_data) / sizeof(some_data[0]); i++)
    {
        some_data[i] = i * 2;
    }
    cudaMemcpyToSymbol(devPtr, some_data, std::min(sizeof(some_data), sizeof(devPtr) ));
    float* otherDevPtr;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&amp;amp;otherDevPtr, 256 * sizeof(*otherDevPtr));
    cudaMemset(otherDevPtr, 0, 256 * sizeof(*otherDevPtr));

    kernel1&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;1,128&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;(otherDevPtr);
    kernel2&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;1,128&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;(otherDevPtr);

    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't forget '--host-compilation=c++' for this example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java collections use &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generics_in_Java" rel="nofollow"&gt;generics&lt;/a&gt; since Java 1.5. So, a good place to use them is when you are creating your own collection-like object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example I see almost everywhere is a Pair class, which holds two objects, but needs to deal with those objects in a generic way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Pair&amp;lt;F, S&amp;gt; {
    public final F first;
    public final S second;

    public Pair(F f, S s)
    { 
        first = f;
        second = s;   
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you use this Pair class you can specify which kind of objects you want it to deal with and any type cast problems will show up at compile time, rather than runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generics can also have their bounds defined with the keywords 'super' and 'extends'. For example, if you want to deal with a generic type but you want to make sure it extends a class called Foo (which has a setTitle method):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class FooManager &amp;lt;F extends Foo&amp;gt;{
    public void setTitle(F foo, String title) {
        foo.setTitle(title);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not very interesting on its own, it's useful to know that whenever you deal with a FooManager, you know that it will handle MyClass types, and that MyClass extends Foo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A multitasking OS allows you to run multiple processes (tasks) "simultaneously". They do not actually run at the same time, of course, since there is only one CPU. What happens is that one process runs for a while, then the OS breaks in (through an interrupt), stores away the state (context) of the current process, restores the context of another, and allows that other process to run for a while, etcetera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS-DOS is an example of a non-multitasking OS: as long as you're playing Commander Keen, no other tasks can run on your computer (including the DOS shell itself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I want to write out the results and since i want to overwrite the file I need to reopen and truncate which results in the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; open (FILE, '&amp;gt;', test.dat'); #single arrow truncates double appends
 flock FILE, 2;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case the file is actually unlocked for a short period of time while the file is reopened. This demonstrates the case for the external lock file. If you are going to be changing contexts of the file, use a lock file. The modified code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;open (LOCK_FILE, '&amp;lt;', test.dat.lock') or die "Could not obtain lock";
flock LOCK_FILE, 2;
open (FILE, '&amp;lt;', test.dat') or die "Could not open file";
# read file
# ...
open (FILE, '&amp;gt;', test.dat') or die "Could not reopen file";
#write file
close (FILE);
close (LOCK_FILE);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you're joining two tables, A and B on their respective columns C and D (A.C=B.D), and your plan shows a clustered index scan (SQL Server term -- not sure of the oracle term) on table A, then a nested loop join to a series of clustered index seeks on table B, you might think there was a problem.  In that scenario, you might expect the engine to do a pair of index scans (over the indexes on the joined columns) followed by a merge join.

Basically you need to realise that every index you add will increase performance on any search by that column (so adding an index to the 'lastname' column of a person table will increase performance on queries that have "where lastname = " in them) but decrease write performance across the whole table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is when you add or update a row, it must add-to or update both the table itself and every index that row is a member of.  So if you have five indexes on a table, each addition must write to six places - five indexes and the table - and an update may be touching up to six places in the worst case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Index creation is a balancing act then between query speed and write speed.  In some cases, such as a datamart that is only loaded with data once a week in an overnight job but queried thousands of times daily, it makes a great deal of sense to overload with indexes and speed the queries up as much as possible.  In the case of online transaction processing systems however, you want to try and find a balance between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in short, add indexes to columns that are used a lot in select queries, but try to avoid adding too many and so add the most-used columns first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that its a matter of load testing to see how the performance reacts under production conditions, and a lot of tweaking to find an aceeptable balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;note the "abstract" and the "=0;".  The abstract allows the class to contain pure virtual members without warning, and the =0; means that this method is pure virtual - that is, it doesn't contain a body.   Note that you can not instantiate an abstract class.&lt;/p&gt;

As such, they want to teach students &lt;strong&gt;how to learn&lt;/strong&gt;, and the fundamental principles of the discipline.  Additionally, algorithms and data structures will apply to any programming language, and is not dependent on specific tools (which may or may not still be in use by graduation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Computer Science, that means algorithms, data structures, computer theory, compiler theory, etc.  The stuff that you're listing is less about understanding how to program, how to solve problems, etc.  It's about the practice of programming (which, incidentally, is an amazing book for anyone in college with the intention of working as a programmer).  Now, much of this will not be used at an entry level code monkey position, leading some people to think it isn't useful.  I disagree.  I think it can be extremely useful.  However, it doesn't mean that after you get your CS degree, you know everything you'll ever need to work as a programmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which also isn't to say that the things you mention aren't useful.  They are.  You'll have trouble working on as a programmer if you don't learn them, and I do think they should be taught in college, at least to a certain extent.  I would look at teaching version control, unit testing, etc, at the same way I would look at an undergraduate programming in art, and the teaching of what paint brushes are and which ones should be used for various cases.&lt;/p&gt;

In order to be a socially accepted "best practice", we need quantitative data which can be very expensive to gather: how much does version control help?  How does it help?  Unit testing?  We can reason about the effectiveness of various techniques, but actually proving that effectiveness conclusively would be very expensive.  We'd need to run a complete, realistic software project from beginning to end, numerous times, with groups of programmers that have equivalent expertise, using different techniques.  At the very least we'd need lots of data about existing projects which those projects would be unwilling to release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civil engineers have thousands of years of bridges to look at, with lots of information.  Software developers, on the other hand, have only a few decades of information, most of which is kept secret, since there's little motivation for organizations to collate and publish information about their developers' effectiveness, even if they are collecting it (which most aren't).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's also some confusion of fields.  Software development, or software "engineering", is really a different thing from computer science.  Software developers need a working knowledge of computer science, but working at the boundaries of algorithmic complexity or reasoning about parallelism isn't something that a working programmer will do every day; similarly, a real "computer scientist" will write tons of throw-away code that just doesn't work or doesn't do anything interesting, and won't benefit as much from the sort of rigor that an actual software product would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emergence of the internet and the open source community may provide enough data to start answering these questions conclusively, but even if the answers were available tomorrow, it will probably take 100 years for them to permeate international society to the point where everyone agrees on what should be taught in schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally there are some economic considerations.  It has been a relatively short time since almost everyone involved in software development had cheap, easy access to dedicated machines to run whatever development tools they want.  A few decades ago, completely dedicating a machine to just running your tests, or even housing an infinite history of source code, would have seemed frivolously expensive to a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full-length descriptive free-form strings make poor indexes, as whoever is performing the query rarely knows the exact value of the string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linearly-ordered data (such as timestamps or dates) are commonly used as a clustered index, which forces the rows to be stored in index order, and allows in-order access, greatly speeding range queries (e.g. 'give me all the sales orders between October and December'). In such a case the DB engine can simply seek to the first record specified by the range and start reading sequentially until it hits the last one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;unsigend char&lt;/em&gt; is often used in computer graphics which very often (though not always) assigns a single byte to each colour component. It is common to see an RGB (or RGBA) colour represented as 24 (or 32) bits, each an &lt;em&gt;unsigned char&lt;/em&gt;. Since &lt;em&gt;unsigned char&lt;/em&gt; values fall in the range [0,255], the values are typically interpreted as &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0 meaning a total lack of a given colour component&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;255 meaning 100% of a given colour pigment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you would end up with RGB red as (255,0,0) -&gt; (100% red, 0% green, 0% blue).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not use a &lt;em&gt;signed char&lt;/em&gt;? Arithmetic and bit shifting becomes problematic. As explained already, a &lt;em&gt;signed char&lt;/em&gt;'s range is essentially shifted by -128. A very simple and naive (mostly unused) method for converting RGB to grayscale is to average all three colour components, but this runs into problems when the values of the colour components are negative. Red (255, 0, 0) averages to (85, 85, 85) when using &lt;em&gt;unsigned char&lt;/em&gt; arithmetic. However, if the values were &lt;em&gt;signed char&lt;/em&gt;s (127,-128,-128), we would end up with (-99, -99, -99), which would be (29, 29, 29) in our &lt;em&gt;unsigned char&lt;/em&gt; space, which is incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

Their idea is generally to give you enough foundations that you can then pick up tools like git and understand what it means when you're told that the underlying datastructure is an acyclic directed graph of SHA-1 hashes, and that the developers have worked hard to optimize the number of syscalls so that it's io-bound.&lt;/p&gt;

Unit testing isn't taught because most of the programs that you have to create arn't large enough to need automated testing, your garanteed a specific set of inputs so can test everything manually. Teaching you how to automate testing may also interfear with the grading of your project since most projects are graded with scripts that run automated tests, with a quick glance at the code to make sure you don't have int foo1; int foo2; and you use proper indentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know why version control wouldn't be taught but part of it is probably the size of projects. I never had any project that was large enough for version control, and by large I mean over 1000 lines of code and took an entire semester to write. I guess they figure you'll teach it to your self if you need it. Any group projects I had were supposed to be pair programming projects, and why use version control if your both at the same computer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know why agile development wouldn't be taught but it probably  goes back to the same thing with program size. While adgile development is common with new software that runs on personal computers and small servers it is not generally used on systems such as IBM mainframes or in problem domains such as banking or medical where documentation is king. It also probably has to do with the fact that adgile development wasn't around 20 years ago when a lot of professors were trained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web server on the other end will be set to a certain port, usually 80 and will only accept requests on that specific port.  Something along the chain will need to be talking to port 80 to the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you control the website, then you can change the port, or get it to accept requests on multiple ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the website is already talking on a different port, you can just use the colon syntax to reference another port (eg:  &lt;a href="http://server.com:1234" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://server.com:1234&lt;/a&gt; for port 1234).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to use a different port on your client end, but you want to talk to port 80 at the web server end, you'll need to route traffic from port x to port 80.  A common way to get this up and running is to use Port Fowarding.  ssh can do this for you, see &lt;a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1816" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for a Unix/technical overview or &lt;a href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/technical/services/ssh/putty/puttyfw.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if you're on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

Also, for applications that access network, a list of network connections for each app. And (if you have access to client computer(s)) it would be cool to be able to see the 'window title' of the app - maybe check each 2-3 minutes  if it changed and save it. Also, a list of files open by the application could be very useful, but it is not a must.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I've interpreted this recently is that the most value you get out of the first draft is the requirements you've gathered and preserved in the form of tests.  If you're careful not to test things that aren't actually requirements of the system, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; refactor your way out of any mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So long as you don't code yourself into a trap where you have to start throwing out tests, you are OK to throw out as much code as you want without losing a significant amount of real work.&lt;/p&gt;

I find it very reassuring to have tests that verify the functionality of my code, but it's been tricky to follow some of the recommened practices of TDD. Namely, writing tests first has been hard. And I'm finding it difficult to make my tests readable (due to extensive use of a mocking library).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose a mocking library called &lt;a href="http://labix.org/mocker" rel="nofollow"&gt;mocker&lt;/a&gt;. I use it a lot since much of the code I'm testing makes calls to (a) other methods in my application that depend on system state or (b) ObjC/Cocoa objects that cannot exist without an event loop, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I've got a lot of tests that look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def test_current_window_controller():
    def test(config):
        ac = AppController()
        m = Mocker()
        ac.iter_window_controllers = iwc = m.replace(ac.iter_window_controllers)
        expect(iwc()).result(iter(config))
        with m:
            result = ac.current_window_controller()
            assert result == (config[0] if config else None)
    yield test, []
    yield test, [0]
    yield test, [1, 0]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that this is actually three tests; all use the same parameterized test function. Here's the code that is being tested:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def current_window_controller(self):
    try:
        # iter_window_controllers() iterates in z-order starting
        # with the controller of the top-most window
        # assumption: the top-most window is the "current" one
        wc = self.iter_window_controllers().next()
    except StopIteration:
        return None
    return wc
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I've noticed with using mocker is that it's easier to write the application code first and then go back and write the tests second, since most of the time I'm mocking many method calls and the syntax to write the mocked calls is much more verbose (thus harder to write) than the application code. It's easier to write the app code and then model the test code off of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that with this testing method (and a bit of discipline) I can easily write code with 100% test coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering if these tests are good tests? Will I regret doing it this way down the road when I finally discover the secret to writing good tests?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I violating the core principles of TDD so much that my testing is in vain?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compute the average (root-mean-square) loudness of the signal over blocks of, say, 5 milliseconds. (Having never done this before, I don't know what a good block size would be.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take the Fourier transform of the "blocked" signal, using the FFT algorithm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the component in the transformed signal that has the largest magnitude.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Fourier transform is basically a way of computing the strength of all frequencies present in the signal. If you do that over the "blocked" signal, the frequency of the beat will hopefully be the strongest one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you need to apply a filter first, to focus on specific frequencies (like the bass) that usually contain the most information about the BPM.&lt;/p&gt;

Honestly, it was a pretty easy migration and when people came back on Monday they were ready to go.  You might think about preparing your employees with Perforce cheat sheets after you start doing the migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest gotchas might actually be preparing your people to use Perforce.  Had I done it over again, I would have migrated our smaller active projects first and prepared smaller numbers of people to use Perforce at once.  As it was, I had to train 120+ people on day 1 after the migration and that was a bit much.  Also, make sure that you don't have 100+ people hitting your server for a fresh sync on day 1 either.  We wound up taking our server down multiple times during the first few days.  We used a windows 32 bit server which I would not recommend.  We have a windows 64bit server now and it's much more robust.  If you can, I would actually use Linux as your OS for your perforce server.  Again, there should be good info on the Perforce site about performance.&lt;/p&gt;

This is easily doable, there are a large number of plugins out there for doing so.  There is a tutorial on the jQuery site for doing this: &lt;a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery#Plug_me:_Writing_your_own_plugins"&gt;Getting Started With jQuery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A gate might also be necessary to cleanup any clutter from other instruments with harmonics that low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next to check would be snare hits.  You'd have to EQ this one.  The "crack" from a snare is around 1.5kHz from memory, but you'd need to definitely gate this one.&lt;/p&gt;

Give it a 150 years, then things might be settling down more.  The number of failed realworld projects makes it obvious that this is an immature industry.  Imagine if 80% of building projects failed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To stop this from occurring you can set the h1 to have inline flow behaviour:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#header &amp;gt; h1 { display: inline; }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for absolutely positioning the img &lt;em&gt;inside the div&lt;/em&gt;, you need to set the containing div to have a "known size" before this will work properly.  In my experience, you also need to change the position attribute away from the default - position: relative works for me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#header { position: relative; width: 20em; height: 20em; }
#img-for-abs-positioning { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can get that to work, you might want to try progressively removing the height, width, position attributes from div.header to get the minimal required attributes to get the effect you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a typical QA perspective, you would want to identify different classifications of inputs. Produce a set of input values for each classification and determine the appropriate outputs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a sample of classes of input values&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;valid triangles with small numbers such as (1 billion, 2, billion, 2 billion)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;valid triangles with large numbers such as (0.000001, 0.00002, 0.00003)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;valid obtuse triangles that are 'almost'flat such as (10, 10, 19.9999)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;valid acute triangles that are 'almost' flat such as (10, 10, 0000001)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;invalid triangles with at least one negative value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;invalid triangles where the sum of two sides equals the third&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;invalid triangles where the sum of two sides is greater than the third&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;input values that are non-numeric&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you are satisfied with the list of input classifications for this function, then you can create the actual test data.  Likely, it would be helpful to test all permutations of each item.  (e.g. (2,3,4), (2,4,3), (3,2,4), (3,4,2), (4,2,3), (4,3,2)) Typically, you'll find there are some classifications you missed (such as the concept of inf as an input parameter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike B is right to assume that the debug fix is hiding a bug.  In release mode, a pointer is being used that has been freed but not set to NULL, and the memory it points to is still "valid".  At some point in the future, memory allocations will change, or the memory image will change, or something will cause the "valid" memory block to become "invalid".  At that point, your release build will start failing.  Switching to debug mode to find the problem will be useless, because the debug mode has been "fixed".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we call all agree that the following code shouldn't work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;char * p = new char[16];     // 16 bytes of random trash
strcpy(p, "StackOverflow");  // 13 characters, a '\0' terminator, and two bytes of trash
delete [] p;                 // return 16 bytes to the heap, but nothing else changes;

if (p != NULL)               // Why would p be NULL?  It was never set to NULL
    ASSERT(p[0] == 'S');     // In debug, this will crash, because p = 0xfeeefeee and 
                             // dereferencing it will cause an error.
                             // Release mode may or may or may not work, depending on
                             // other memory operations
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As just about every other poster has said, pointers should be set to NULL after calling delete.  Whether you do it yourself or use boost or some other wrapper or even the macro in this thread is up to you.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;how to best parse/access/extract "excel file" data stored as binary data in an SQL 2005 field?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(so all the data can ultimately be stored in other fields of other tables.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;basically, our customer is requiring a large volume of verbose data from their users. unfortunately, our customer cannot require any kind of db export from their user. so our customer must supply some sort of UI for their user to enter the data. the UI our customer decided would be acceptable to all of their users was excel as it has a reasonably robust UI. so given all that, and our customer needs this data parsed and stored in their db automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we've tried to convince our customer that the users will do this exactly once and then insist on db export! but the customer can not &lt;em&gt;require&lt;/em&gt; db export of their users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;our customer is requiring us to parse an excel file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the customer's users are using excel as the "best" user interface to enter all the required data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the users are given blank excel templates that they must fill out
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;these templates have a fixed number of uniquely named tabs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;these templates have a number of fixed areas (cells) that must be completed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;these templates also have areas where the user will insert up to thousands of identically formatted rows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when complete, the excel file is submitted from the user by standard html file upload&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;our customer stores this file raw into their SQL database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;given&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a standard excel (".xls") file (native format, not comma or tab separated)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;file is stored raw in a &lt;code&gt;varbinary(max)&lt;/code&gt; SQL 2005 field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;excel file data may not necessarily be "uniform" between rows -- i.e., we can't just assume one column is all the same data type (e.g., there may be row headers, column headers, empty cells, different "formats", ...)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;code completely within SQL 2005 (stored procedures, SSIS?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be able to access values on any worksheet (tab)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be able to access values in any cell (no formula data or dereferencing needed)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cell values must not be assumed to be "uniform" between rows -- i.e., we can't just assume one column is all the same data type (e.g., there may be row headers, column headers, empty cells, formulas, different "formats", ...)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;preferences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no filesystem access (no writing temporary .xls files)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;retrieve values in defined format (e.g., actual date value instead of a raw number like 39876)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I like &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/79367/sql-text-searching-and-ordering#79380"&gt;Brian's idea&lt;/a&gt;; add a constant column and UNION the queries and you could even get everything in one result set.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT 1 as rank, * FROM Items WHERE column LIKE '%foo%' AND column LIKE '%bar%'
UNION
SELECT 2 as rank, * FROM Items WHERE column LIKE '%foo%' AND column NOT LIKE '%bar%'
UNION
SELECT 2 as rank, * FROM Items WHERE column LIKE '%bar%' AND column NOT LIKE '%foo%'
ORDER BY rank
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this would only give you something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The unordered set of all rows that match foo and match bar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;followed by (the unordered set of) all rows that match foo or bar, but not both (although you could break this up into two separate groups using a different constant in the last SELECT statement).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which might be just what you're looking for, but it wouldn't tell you which rows matched foo three times, or sort them ahead of rows that only contained one instance of foo.  Also all those LIKEs can get expensive.  If what you're really looking to do is sort results based on relevance (however you define that) you might be better off using a full text index.  If you're using MS SQL Server, it has a built-in service that will do this, and there are also third-party products that will do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: After looking at all the other answers (there were only &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; when I started mine - I'm obviously going to have to learn to think faster ;-) ) it's obvious that there are several ways to go about this, depending on exactly what you're trying to accomplish.  I would advise you to test and compare solutions based on how they perform &lt;strong&gt;on your system&lt;/strong&gt;.  I'm not a performance/tuning expert, but functions tend to slow things down, especially if you're sorting on the result of a function.  The LIKE operator isn't necessarily spry, either.  As a developer, it seems natural to use familiar constructs like "IF" and "CASE", but queries that use more of a set-based approach usually have better performance in a RDMS.  Again, YMMV, so it's best to test if you're at all concerned about performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for architecture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SuperServer is a single-process multi-threaded server (like Apache on Windows, for example)
Classic is a multi-process single-threade server - things are synced via a separate lock manager process
Embedded is a DLL you hook up to your application and work with database file directly&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SuperServer is good for OLTP, lot of users, etc. Classic is good for OLAP or few users running heavy queries. Embedded is good for desktop apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should install and use SuperServer while developing, since embedded only allows one connection at a time, so you cannot access the database from your application and administration tool at the same time. Later, you can deploy using any of those 3 architectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started, keep in mind that any worthwhile comparison method will essentially work by converting the images into a different form -- a form which makes it easier to pick similar features out.  Usually, this stuff doesn't make for very light reading ...
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
One of the simplest examples I can think of is simply using the color space of each image.  If two images have highly similar color distributions, then you can be reasonably sure that they show the same thing.  At least, you can have enough certainty to flag it, or do more testing.  Comparing images in color space will also resist things such as rotation, scaling, and some cropping.  It won't, of course, resist heavy modification of the image or heavy recoloring (and even a simple hue shift will be somewhat tricky).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_space"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_space&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://upvector.com/index.php?section=tutorials&amp;amp;subsection=tutorials/colorspace"&gt;http://upvector.com/index.php?section=tutorials&amp;amp;subsection=tutorials/colorspace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example involves something called the Hough Transform.  This transform essentially decomposes an image into a set of lines.  You can then take some of the 'strongest' lines in each image and see if they line up.  You can do some extra work to try and compensate for rotation and scaling too -- and in this case, since comparing a few lines is MUCH less computational work than doing the same to entire images -- it won't be so bad.&lt;/p&gt;

You should pay attention and read what I wrote again because I never suggested not calling delete[] and just let the OS clean up.  And you're wrong about the C++ run-time libraries managing the heap.  If that were the case then C++ would not be portable as is today and a crashing application would never get cleaned up by the OS. (acknowledging there are OS specific run-times that make C/C++ appear non-portable).  I challenge you to find stdlib.h in the Linux sources from kernel.org.  The new keyword in C++ actually is talking to the same memory management routines as malloc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The C++ run-time libraries make OS system calls and it's the OS that manages the heaps.  You are partly correct in that the run-time libraries indicate when to release the memory however, they don't actually walk any heap tables directly.  In other words, the runtime you link against does not add code to your application to walk heaps to allocate or deallocate. This is the case in Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX, etc...  It's also the reason you won't fine malloc in any Linux's kernel source nor will you find stdlib.h in Linux source.  Understand these modern operating system have virtual memory managers that complicates things a bit further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever wonder why you can make a call to malloc for 2G of RAM on a 1G box and still get back a valid memory pointer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory management on x86 processors is managed within Kernel space using three tables.  PAM (Page Allocation Table), PD (Page Directories) and PT (Page Tables).  This is at the hardware level I'm speaking of.  One of the things the OS memory manager does, not your C++ application, is to find out how much physical memory is installed on the box during boot with help of BIOS calls.  The OS also handles exceptions such as when you try to access memory your application does not have rights too. (GPF General Protection Fault).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be that we are saying the same thing Matt, but I think you may be confusing the under hood functionality a bit.  I use to maintain a C/C++ compiler for a living...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the JFormattedTextField must verify if the date entered is valid, and reject it somehow if the date is invalid, or "correct it" to a valid date, such as if the user input "13" as month, set it as "01" and add +1 to the year.&lt;/p&gt;

I don't want to be an echo but I wanted to elaborate a bit more in detail: Not only does it provide the actual timings from SQL Server (as opposed to timing from the app-side where network i/o, connection and connection pool timings are added to the cake) but it also gives you the [often more important] I/O statistics figures, locking info (as needed) etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I/O statistics are important is that a very expensive query may run fast while consuming excessive amounts of server resources. If for example a query that is executed often hits large tables and there are no matching indexes resulting table scans, the affected tables will be cached in memory by SQL Server (if it can). This can sometimes cause the same query to execute blazingly fast while in effect it is harming the rest of the system/app/db by eating up server resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Locking info is almost as important -&gt; tiny queries doing PK lookups for a single record can have bad timings due to locking and blocking. I read somewhere that this very site was plagued by deadlocks in its' early beta days. SQL Profiler is your friend for identifying and resolving problems caused by locking too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize it; whether you use L2S, EF, plain ADO - if you want to make sure your app "behaves nice" towards the database always have SQL Profiler ready during development and testing. It pays off!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; Since I wrote the answer above I have developed a new runtime profiling tool for L2S that bring the best of both worlds together; I/O stats and server-side timings from SQL Server, SQL Server execution plan, SQL Server's "missing index" alerts, combined with the managed call stack to make it easy to find what code generated a certain query, and some advanced filter options to log only queries that fulfill certain criteria. Additionally, the logging component can be distributed with apps to make runtime query profiling in live customer environments easier. The tool can be downloaded from:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use an email library. Python includes one called 'email'. This is your friend, it will stop you from doing anything tragically wrong. Read an example from &lt;a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/node161.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;the Python Manual&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some points that will stop you from getting blocked by spam filters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always send from a valid email address. You must be able to send email to this address and have it received (it can go into /dev/null after it's received, but it must be possible to /deliver/ there). This will stop spam filters that do Sender Address Verification from blocking your mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The email address you send from on the server.sendmail(fromaddr, [toaddr]) line will be where bounces go. The From: line in the email is a totally different address, and that's where mail will go when the user hits 'Reply:'. Use this to your advantage, bounces can go to one place, while reply goes to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Send email to a local mail server, I recommend postfix. This local server will receive your mail and be responsible for sending it to your upstream server. Once it has been delivered to the local server, treat it as 'sent' from a programmatic point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a site that is on a static ip in a datacenter of good reputation, don't be afraid to simply relay the mail directly to the internet. If you're in a datacenter full of script kiddies and spammers, you will need to relay this mail via a public MTA of good reputation, hopefully you will be able to work this out without a hassle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't send an email in only HTML. Always send it in Plain and HTML, or just Plain. Be nice, I use a text only email client, and you don't want to annoy me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verify that you're not running SPF on your email domain, or get it configured to allow your server to send the mail. Do this by doing a TXT lookup on your domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ dig google.com txt
...snip...
;; ANSWER SECTION:
google.com.  300 IN TXT "v=spf1 include:_netblocks.google.com ~all"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see from that result, there's an SPF record there. If you don't have SPF, there won't be a TXT record. Read more about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework" rel="nofollow"&gt;SPF on wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps.&lt;/p&gt;

The only way to know when your data has been "received", for any useful definition of "received", is to have a specific acknowledgment message in your protocol which indicates the data has been fully processed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data does not "leave" your network card, exactly.  The best way to think of your program's relationship to the network is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;your program -&gt; lots of confusing stuff -&gt; the peer program&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A list of things that might be in the "lots of confusing stuff":&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the CLR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the operating system kernel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a virtualized network interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a switch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a software firewall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a hardware firewall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a router performing network address translation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a router on the peer's end performing network address translation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you are on a virtual machine, which is hosted under a different operating system, that has a software firewall which is controlling the virtual machine's network behavior - when has the data "really" left your network card?  Even in the best case scenario, many of these components may drop a packet, which your network card will need to re-transmit.  Has it "left" your network card when the first (unsuccessful) attempt has been made?  Most networking APIs would say no, it hasn't been "sent" until the other end has sent a TCP acknowledgement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.sockets.networkstream.write.aspx"&gt;the documentation for NetworkStream.Write&lt;/a&gt; seems to indicate that it will not return until it has at least initiated the 'send' operation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Write method blocks until the requested number of bytes is sent or a SocketException is thrown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, "is sent" is somewhat vague for the reasons I gave above.  There's also the possibility that the data will be "really" sent by your program and received by the peer program, but the peer will crash or otherwise not actually process the data.  So you should do a &lt;code&gt;Write&lt;/code&gt; followed by a &lt;code&gt;Read&lt;/code&gt; of a message that will only be emitted by your peer when it has actually processed the message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers should do unit testing with  code-coverage for the code being written as a minimal goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The responsibility for these are mixed between QA and Development based on some mutual agreement on what makes most sense. Some component testing can only be done by unit testing, others are 'sufficiently' tested during integration testing etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk to each other, find out what everyone is most comfortable doing. It will take some time, but it's well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This appends the date, time and uptime to the uptime.hist file every ten minutes while the machine is running. You can then examine this file manually to figure out the information or write a script to process it as you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever the uptime reduces, there's been a reboot since the previous record. When there are large gaps between lines (i.e., more than the expected ten minutes), the machine's been down during that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can do this with a class with no performance penalty, then that's the way to go.  It depends heavily on the compiler and how it inlines.  If there is a performance penalty using classes, then you need a more traditional C-style approach.  The OOP approach will give you compiler-enforced type safety which the traditional implementation only approximates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@cibyr has a good OOP implementation.  Now for the more traditional one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep track of which variables are scaled, you need to use a consistent convention.  Make a notation at the end of each variable name to indicate whether the value is scaled or not, and write macros SCALE() and UNSCALE() that expand to x&gt;&gt;8 and x&amp;lt;&amp;lt;8.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#define SCALE(x) (x&amp;gt;&amp;gt;8)
#define UNSCALE(x) (x&amp;lt;&amp;lt;8)

xPositionUnscaled = UNSCALE(10);
xPositionScaled = SCALE(xPositionUnscaled);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may seem like extra work to use so much notation, but notice how you can tell at a glance that any line is correct without looking at other lines. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;xPositionScaled = SCALE(xPositionScaled);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is obviously wrong, by inspection.&lt;/p&gt;

The inner function acquires and stores a large vector of data in memory (as a global variable... I'm using "R" which is like "S-Plus"). The loop loops through a long list of data to be acquired. The outer function starts the process and passes in the list of datasets to be acquired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I programmed the inner function to store each dataset before moving to the next, so all the work of the outer function occurs as side effects on global variables... a big no-no. Is this better or worse than collecting and returning a giant, memory-hogging vector of vectors? Is there a superior third approach?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would the answer change if I were storing the data vectors in a database rather than in memory? Ideally, I'd like to be able to terminate the function (or have it fail due to network timeouts) without losing all the information processed prior to termination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't have a tested solution for you, but I can share how I would give my first try on a problem like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first approach would be to install excel on the SqlServer machine and code some assemblies to consume the file on your rows using excel API and then load them on Sql server as assembly procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said, This is just a idea, I don't have details, but I'm sure others here can complement or criticize my idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my real advice is to rethink the whole project. It makes no sense to read tabular data on binary files stored on a cell of a row of a table on database. &lt;/p&gt;
