Typically you want to avoid the use of a "Strict" mock because it makes for a brittle test. A strict mock will throw an exception if anything occurs that you do not explicitly tell Rhino will happen. Also I think you may be misunderstanding exactly what Rhino is doing when you make a call to create a mock. Think of it as a custom Object that has either been derived from, or implements the System.Type you defined. If you did it yourself it would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class FakeUserType: User
{
    //overriding code here
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since IsAdministrator is probably just a public property on the User type you can't override it in the inheriting type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as your question is concerned there are multiple ways you could handle this. You could implement IsAdministrator as a virtual property on your user class as &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/78389/rhinomocks-correct-way-to-mock-property-getter#78428"&gt;aaronjensen&lt;/a&gt; mentioned as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class User
{
 public virtual Boolean IsAdministrator { get; set; }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an ok approach, but only if you plan on inheriting from your User class. Also if you wan't to fake other members on this class they would also have to be virtual, which is probably not the desired behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to accomplish this is through the use of interfaces. If it is truly the User class you are wanting to Mock then I would extract an interface from it. Your above example would look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public interface IUser
{
 Boolean IsAdministrator { get; }
}

public class User : IUser
{
 private UserSecurity _userSecurity = new UserSecurity();

 public Boolean IsAdministrator
 {
  get { return _userSecurity.HasAccess("AdminPermissions"); }
 }
}

public void CreateSomethingIfUserHasAdminPermissions()
{
 IUser user = _mocks.StrictMock&amp;lt;IUser&amp;gt;();
 SetupResult.For(user.IsAdministrator).Return(true);

 // do something with my User object
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get fancier if you want by using &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html"&gt;dependency injection and IOC&lt;/a&gt; but the basic principle is the same across the board. Typically you want your classes to depend on interfaces rather than concrete implementations anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps. I have been using RhinoMocks for a long time on a major project now so don't hesitate to ask me questions about TDD and mocking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's best to concentrate on your Cost and Cardinality. Looking at the examples the use of the index reduces the Cost of running the query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a bit more complicated (and i don't have a 100% handle on it) but basically the Cost is a function of CPU and IO cost, and the Cardinality is the number of rows Oracle expects to parse. Reducing both of these is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't forget that the Cost of a query can be influenced by your query and the Oracle optimiser model (eg: COST, CHOOSE etc) and how often you run your statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the mail server "brand" itself isn't that important for broadcasting or receiving emails.  All of them support the standard smtp / pop3 communications protocol. Most even have IMAP support and have some level of spam filtering.  That said, try to use a current generation email server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, be aware that in an effort to reduce spam a lot of the receiving mail servers out there will simply throw a message away instead of responding back that a mail account doesn't exist.  Which means you may not receive those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind that getting past spam filters is an art.  A number of isp's watch for duplicate messages, messages that &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; like spam based on keywords or other content, etc.  This is sometimes independent of the quantity of messages sent; I've seen messages with as few as 50 copies get blocked by AOL even though they were legitimate emails.  So, testing is your friend and look into &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-spam_techniques_(e-mail)" rel="nofollow"&gt;this article on wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; on anti-spam techniques.  Then make sure your not doing that crap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as processing the messages, just remember it's a queued system.  Connect to the server via POP3 to retrieve messages, open it, do some action, delete the message or archive it, and move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regards to bouncebacks, let the mail server do most of the work.  You should be able to configure it to notify a certain email account on the server in the event that it is unable to deliver a message.  You can check that account periodically and process the Non Delivery Reports as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is tricky, because there are many variables involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Python web applications can take advantage of &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/"&gt;mod_wsgi&lt;/a&gt; to talk to web servers, which is faster than any of the typical ways that PHP talks to web servers (even mod_php ends up being slower if you're using Apache, because Apache can only use the Prefork MPM with mod_php rather than multi-threaded MPM like Worker).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the issue of code compilation. As you know, Python is compiled just-in-time to byte code (.pyc files) when a file is run each time the file changes. Therefore, after the first run of a Python file, the compilation step is skipped and the Python interpreter simply fetches the precompiled .pyc file. Because of this, one could argue that Python has a native advantage over PHP. However, optimizers and caching systems can be installed for PHP websites (my favorite is &lt;a href="http://eaccelerator.net/"&gt;eAccelerator&lt;/a&gt;) to much the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, enough tools exist such that one can pretty much do everything that the other can do. Of course, as others have mentioned, there's more than just speed involved in the business case to switch languages. We have an app written in oCaml at my current employer, which turned out to be a mistake because the original author left the company and nobody else wants to touch it. Similarly, the PHP-web community is much larger than the Python-web community; Website hosting services are more likely to offer PHP support than Python support; etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But back to speed. You must recognize that the question of speed here involves many moving parts. Fortunately, many of these parts can be independently optimized, affording you various avenues to seek performance gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I want to allow users to publish pages and give them each a subdomain of their choice (ex: user.mysite.com). From what I can gather, the best way to do this is to map user.mysite.com to mysite.com/user with mod_rewrite and .htaccess - is that correct?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Some of these answers have been REALLY helpful, but for the system I have in mind, manually adding a subdomain for each user is not an option. What I'm really asking is how to do this on the fly, and redirect wildcard.mysite.com to mysite.com/wildcard -- the way Tumblr is set up is a perfect example of what I'd like to do.

My advice is to treat ALL numbers as integers scaled to a specific factor.  For example, all monetary values are in cents as integers rather than dollars as floats.  For example, 0.72 is represented as the integer 72.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addition and subtraction are then a very simple integer operation such as (0.72 + 1 becomes 72 + 100 becomes 172 becomes 1.72).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiplication is slightly more complex as it needs an integer multiply followed by a scale back such as (0.72 * 2 becomes 72 * 200 becomes 14400 becomes 144 (scaleback) becomes 1.44).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That may require special functions for performing more complex math (sine, cosine, etc) but even those can be sped up by using lookup tables.  Example: since you're using fixed-2 representation, there's only 100 values in the range (0.0,1] (0-99) and sin/cos repeat outside this range so you only need a 100-integer lookup table.&lt;/p&gt;

Pax.&lt;/p&gt;

So for example if I have an expiry set to "08 March 2008" I want that value to be returned to any client - no matter what their timezone is. 
The problem with remoting it as a DateTime is that it gets stored/sent as "08 March 2008 00:00", which means for clients connecting from any timezone West of me it gets converted and therefore flipped to "07 March 2008"
Any suggestions for cleanly handling this scenario ? Obviously sending it as a string would work. anything else ?

&lt;a href="http://www.digitalsignallabs.com/fp.pdf"&gt;http://www.digitalsignallabs.com/fp.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you need to do "profiling" on your floating point code to figure out the appropriate range of fixed-point values required at "critical" points in your code, e.g. U(5,3) = 5 bits to the left, 3 bits to the right, unsigned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, you can apply the arithmetic rules in the paper mentioned above; the rules specify how to interpret the bits which result from arithmetic operations.  You can write macros or functions to perform the operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's handy to keep the floating point version around, in order to compare the floating point vs fixed point results.&lt;/p&gt;

This is sitting in a MySQL database. I need to create bar charts based on this data with the 24 hours of the day along the bottom and the amount of man-hours worked for each hour of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if Alice worked a job from 15:30 to 19:30 and Bob worked from 12:15 to 17:00, the chart would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a WTFey solution right now that involves a spreadsheet going out to column DY or something like that. The needed resolution is 15-minute intervals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can translate this to C# using PInvoke. First, we implement these macros as functions, and then add whatever
other support is needed to make those functions work. Here is my first shot at it. You should double check my
code especially when it comes to the marshalling of the struct. Further, you may want to Post the message cross-thread
instead of calling SendMessage.&lt;/p&gt;

are unmodified and the resulting process may cause an Access Violation. This would be a problem in whatever
language you use (C++ or C#), so perhaps I am wrong here (you say you have a working C++ program).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dial method is just going to be itself a sequence of row and column methods.  You have to ask what those methods depend on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the sequence of row methods doesn't depend on knowing exactly which column object is involved (but does depend on which particular row object is involved) and &lt;em&gt;vice versa&lt;/em&gt; for the sequence of column methods, then the problem scales as m + n (m = num. rows, n = num. cols).  When you create a new row it doesn't actually save you any work had the column method been assigned the 'dial' method.  You still have to specify a unique sequence of row methods for use in 'dial' somewhere! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, however, say the sequence of column methods inside 'dial' doesn't even depend on which &lt;em&gt;column&lt;/em&gt; object is involved (they use one 'generic' sequence of column methods), then the problem just scales as m.  It doesn't actually matter if you've assigned the 'dial' method to the column objects, the program still scales as m; essentially no work is required to make a new dial method when adding 1 more column object and you clearly have the option of abstracting all those dial methods themselves into one generic dial method.&lt;/p&gt;

You have to show him that he is responsible for the ROI of the project, and for that, he is responsible for prioritizing the stories/itens/business needs/features or whatever you are using to compose your Product backlog in a manner that the most valuable itens are with higher priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm in favor of using user stories as product backlog itens and then, at the sprint planning, breaking on smaller tasks the stories selected to compose the sprint backlog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you should always have in mind when writting, or helping your PO to write, your user stories is that the stories should be INVEST. &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;ndependent, &lt;strong&gt;N&lt;/strong&gt;egotiable, &lt;strong&gt;V&lt;/strong&gt;aluable to customers, &lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;stimatable, &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;mall and &lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;estable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"As a - type of user -, I want -some goal- so that -some reason-."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One story example would be "As a stackoverflow user, I want to vote on an answer so that the most valuable answer can easily be finded."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't forget to make the PO write or define the acceptance Test for each story of your Sprint Backlog as it can be use as a basic criteria to determine if a story is fully implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the example above, two possible acceptance test are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Test to vote up a answer"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Test to Vote Down a answer"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this story and two acceptance test the team knows that the stackoverflow user can vote on the answers and to the story status be updated do Done, it is necessary that the system allow the user to vote up and down an answer without throwing exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

If you don't have professors that havent been "using" what they teach, its all in their head, literally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plug: Having taking BS in Comp Sci and MS in Soft Eng at DePaul University, I was mostly taught by instructors/professors who taught part time, which was fine by me because I would rather have them come in with a anecdote from the previous day and relate it to class.
Also this being a mostly commuter/part-time school, most of the students have jobs in using what they are learning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of learning still starts with the all the theory, but then we usually get asked "how many of you actually use this in your job?" and the typical answer is "we use it but in a stripped down or simplier way" and then we go into the practical real world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my schooling unit testing was always present.  Even though they start you out on Java, they made us use ANT and JUnit for all project.  Which was a good starting on build configuration and unit testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you've set that up with the DNS host, from your web app you really are just URL rewriting, which can be done with some sort of module for the web server itself, such as isapi rewrite if you're on IIS (this would be the prefered route if possible). You could also handle rewriting at the application level as well (like using routing if on ASP.NET).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'd rewrite the URL so &lt;a href="http://myname.domain.com"&gt;http://myname.domain.com&lt;/a&gt; would become &lt;a href="http://domain.com/something.aspx?name=myname"&gt;http://domain.com/something.aspx?name=myname&lt;/a&gt; or something. From there on out, you just handle it as if the myname value was in the query string as normal. Does that make sense? Hope I didn't misunderstand what you're after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not suggesting that you create a subdomain for each user, but instead create a wildcard subdomain for the domain itself, so &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;.domain.com (basically *.domain.com) goes to your site. I have several domains setup with &lt;a href="http://www.mydomain.com/"&gt;mydomain&lt;/a&gt;. Their instructions for setting this up is like this:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes, you can configure a wild card but
  it will only work if you set it up as
  an A Record. Wildcards do not work
  with a C Name. To use a wildcard, you
  use the astericks character '*'. For
  example, if you create and A Record
  using a wild card, &lt;em&gt;.domain.com,
  anything that is entered in the place
  where the '&lt;/em&gt;' is located, will resolve
  to the specified IP address. So if you
  enter 'www', 'ftp', 'site', or
  anything else before the domain name,
  it will always resolve to the IP
  address&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have some that are setup in just this way, having *.domain.com go to my site. I then can read the base URL in my web app to see that ryan.domain.com is what was currently accessed, or that bill.domain.com is what was used. I can then either:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use URL rewriting so that the subdomain becomes a part of the query string OR   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simply read the host value from the accessed URL and perform some logic based on that value.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does that make sense? I have several sites set up in just this exact way: create the wildcard for the domain with the DNS host and then simply read the host, or base domain from the URL to decide what to display based on the subdomain (which was actually a username)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 2:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no way to do this without a DNS entry. The "online world" needs to know that name1.domain.com, name2.domain.com,...,nameN.domain.com all go to the IP address for your server. The only way to do this is with the appropriate DNS entry. You have to add the wildcard DNS entry for your domain with your DNS host. Then it's just a matter of you reading the subdomain from the URL and taking the appropriate action in your code.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPD is the PMD "Copy/Paste Detector" tool. I was using PMD for a little while before I noticed the &lt;a href="http://pmd.sourceforge.net/cpd.html"&gt;"Finding Duplicated Code" link&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="http://pmd.sourceforge.net"&gt;PMD web page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd like to point out that these tools can sometimes be extended beyond their "out-of-the-box" set of rules. And not just because they're open source so that you can rewrite them. Some of these tools come with applications or "hooks" that allow them to be extended. For example, PMD comes with the &lt;a href="http://pmd.sourceforge.net/howtowritearule.html"&gt;"designer" tool&lt;/a&gt; that allows you to create new rules. Also, Checkstyle has the &lt;a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config_misc.html#DescendantToken"&gt;DescendantToken&lt;/a&gt; check that has properties that allow for substantial customization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I integrate these tools with &lt;a href="http://virtualteamtls.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/virtualteamtls/trunk/scm/common.xml?view=markup"&gt;an Ant-based build&lt;/a&gt;. You can follow the link to see my commented configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the simple integration into the build, I find it helpful to configure the tools to be somewhat "integrated" in a couple of other ways. Namely, report generation and warning suppression uniformity. I'd like to add these aspects to this discussion (which should probably have the "static-analysis" tag also): how are folks configuring these tools to create a "unified" solution? (I've asked this question separately &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/79918/configuring-static-analysis-tools-for-uniformity"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, for warning reports, I transform the output so that each warning has the simple format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/absolute-path/filename:line-number:column-number: warning(tool-name): message&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is often called the "Emacs format," but even if you aren't using Emacs, it's a reasonable format for homogenizing reports. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/project/src/com/example/Foo.java:425:9: warning(Checkstyle):Missing a Javadoc comment.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My warning format transformations are done by my Ant script with Ant &lt;a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/filterchain.html"&gt;filterchains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second "integration" that I do is for warning suppression. By default, each tool supports comments or an annotation (or both) that you can place in your code to silence a warning that you want to ignore. But these various warning suppression requests do not have a consistent look which seems somewhat silly. When you're suppressing a warning, you're suppressing a warning, so why not always write "&lt;code&gt;SuppressWarning&lt;/code&gt;?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, PMD's default configuration suppresses warning generation on lines of code with the string "&lt;code&gt;NOPMD&lt;/code&gt;" in a comment. Also, PMD supports Java's &lt;code&gt;@SuppressWarnings&lt;/code&gt; annotation. I configure PMD to use comments containing "&lt;code&gt;SuppressWarning(PMD.&lt;/code&gt;" instead of &lt;code&gt;NOPMD&lt;/code&gt; so that PMD suppressions look alike. I fill in the particular rule that is violated when using the comment style suppression:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// SuppressWarnings(PMD.PreserveStackTrace) justification: (false positive) exceptions are chained&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only the "&lt;code&gt;SuppressWarnings(PMD.&lt;/code&gt;" part is significant for a comment, but it is consistent with PMD's support for the &lt;code&gt;@SuppressWarning&lt;/code&gt; annotation which does recognize individual rule violations by name:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;@SuppressWarnings("PMD.CompareObjectsWithEquals") // justification: identity comparision intended&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Checkstyle suppresses warning generation between pairs of comments (no annotation support is provided). By default, comments to turn Checkstyle off and on contain the strings &lt;code&gt;CHECKSTYLE:OFF&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CHECKSTYLE:ON&lt;/code&gt;, respectively. Changing this configuration (with Checkstyle's "SuppressionCommentFilter") to use the strings "&lt;code&gt;BEGIN&amp;nbsp;SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle.&lt;/code&gt;" and "&lt;code&gt;END&amp;nbsp;SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle.&lt;/code&gt;" makes the controls look more like PMD:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;// BEGIN SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField) justification: "Effective Java," 2nd ed., Bloch, Item 2&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;// END SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Checkstyle comments, the particular check violation (&lt;code&gt;HiddenField&lt;/code&gt;) &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; significant because each check has its own "&lt;code&gt;BEGIN/END&lt;/code&gt;" comment pair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FindBugs also supports warning generation suppression with a &lt;code&gt;@SuppressWarnings&lt;/code&gt; annotation, so no further configuration is required to achieve some level of uniformity with other tools. Unfortunately, Findbugs has to support a custom &lt;code&gt;@SuppressWarnings&lt;/code&gt; annotation because the built-in Java &lt;code&gt;@SuppressWarnings&lt;/code&gt; annotation has a &lt;code&gt;SOURCE&lt;/code&gt; retention policy which is not strong enough to retain the annotation in the class file where FindBugs needs it. I fully qualify FindBugs warnings suppressions to avoid clashing with Java's &lt;code&gt;@SuppressWarnings&lt;/code&gt; annotation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;@edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.SuppressWarnings("UWF&amp;#95;FIELD&amp;#95;NOT&amp;#95;INITIALIZED&amp;#95;IN&amp;#95;CONSTRUCTOR")&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These techniques makes things look reasonably consistent across tools. Note that having each warning suppression contain the string "&lt;code&gt;SuppressWarnings&lt;/code&gt;" makes it easy to run a simple search to find all instances for all tools over an entire code base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, if you're just implementing a supervisory or visualisation layer over an existing real-time system (say, implementing a SCADA-type system), then .NET should be fine. Then your network architecture can boil down to two scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clients poll from a server: you create a centralised server which contains much of your process logic, and clients poll from this server periodically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server supports a publish/subscribe mechanism: clients subscribe to the server's information, and the server sends out updates when they occur.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than go through a full course, here are a couple approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I estimate the bugs in my software?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with the history, you know how many you found during testing (hopefully) and you know how many were found after the fact. You can use that to estimate how efficient you are at finding bugs (DDR - Defect Detection Rate is one name for this). If you can show that for some consistent time period, your DDR is consistent (or improving) you can provide some insight into the quality of the release by guessing at the number of post-release defects that will be found once the product is released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What techniques do I use to ensure the quality is good?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Root cause analysis on your bugs will point you to specific components that are buggy, specific developers that create buggy code, the fact that lacking full requirements results in implementation not matching expectations, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project Review meetings to quickly identify what was good, so those things can be repeated and what was bad and find a way to not do those again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, these give you a good start. Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, when you run a tiny C# Win Forms app, the smallest amount of RAM that is reserved for it is around 2 meg, maybe 4 meg. This is just a working set that it creates. It's not actively using all of this memory, or anything like it. It just reserves that much space up front so it doesn't have to do long/slow/expensive requests for more memory later as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reserving a smaller size upfront is likely to be a false optimization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(You can reduce the working set with a pinvoke call if it really matters. see &lt;a href="http://www.pinvoke.net/default.aspx/kernel32.SetProcessWorkingSetSize" rel="nofollow"&gt;pinvoke for 'set process working set size'&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;

I still prefer Visual Studio, but Code::Blocks can open my Visual Studio projects, and it doesn't seem to want me to waste any time, so it's the winningmost *nix IDE for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bugzilla is bug tracking. That is the beginning and the end.  Bugzilla has a very primitive UI. Bugzilla has very primitive reporting. Bugzilla has no extensibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JIRA is bug, issue, feature, task tracking, and project management. Very nice, highly usable UI. Rich and extensive reporting. Highly extensible. Easily integrated with other applications (including the powerful Atlassian suite).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am in the midst of my 3rd JIRA migration. My current company was on Bugzilla when we started. The change has been a night and day difference. My boss loves it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you can try it out for free. Atlassian has an extremely liberal trial usage policy. You can use it until you are convinced you want to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, download JIRA, install it, start playing with it. Showing it to your boss. Do a trial migration from Bugzilla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a COM Interop assembly from Visual Studio (e.g. Microsoft Visual C# 2005 Express Edition):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new Class Library project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open the project properties&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under Application select Assembly Information... and enable "Make assembly COM-Visible"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under Signing enable Sign the assembly and create or select an existing strong name key file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write and build the library&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COM Interop classes must have a default constructor and only non-static classes and methods are published&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copy the .dll to the desired folder/machine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Register the .dll for COM using RegAsm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;"C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\RegAsm.exe" "C:\path\to\assembly.dll" /tlb /codebase
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call the assembly from ASP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example (adjust as necessary):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Dim obj, returnValue
Set obj = Server.CreateObject("MyProject.MyClass")
returnValue = obj.DoSomething(param1, param2)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the assembly must be re-registered via RegAsm when it's updated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;a href="http://pytz.sourceforge.net/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pytz&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; module, which comes with a full list of time zones + UTC. Figure out what the local timezone is, construct a timezone object from it, and manipulate and attach it to the naive datetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, use &lt;code&gt;datetime.astimezone()&lt;/code&gt; method to convert the datetime to UTC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source code, using local timezone "America/Los_Angeles", for the string "2001-2-3 10:11:12":&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import pytz, datetime
local = pytz.timezone ("America/Los_Angeles")

attributes that do not have errors attached to them. 
So a model can be updated without being valid overall, and this will 
still prevent saving invalid data to the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By "valid attributes", I mean those attributes that give nil when calling @model_instance.errors.on(:attribute)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone have an idea of how to accomplish this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I have the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def save_valid_attributes 
 valid? 
 update_atrtibutes attributes.inject({}){|k, v, m| m[k] = v unless errors_on(k.to_sym); m} 
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works if there's no processing done on assignment, which in my case there is.
For example, I have a database column "start_date", and two methods defined:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def nice_start_date=(startdate)
 self.start_date = Chronic.parse(startdate) || startdate
end

def nice_start_date
 self.start_date.to_s
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two methods allow me to properly parse the user inputted dates using Chronic before saving. So, second way of doing this, one attribute at a time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def save_valid_attributes(attrib) 
  valid?
  attrib.each{|(k,v)| send("${k}=", v); save; reload)
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model needs to be reloaded each time since, if one of the dates is invalid and doesn't save, it will prevent all further attributes from saving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a better way to do this? I'm sure this isn't an uncommon problem in the Rails world, I just can't seem to find anything in the Google universe of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Events have little significant overhead in comparison to a regular function call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of Delegates can create implicit and thus hidden garbage.  Garbage can be a major cause performance problems especially on the XBox360.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following code generates around 2000 bytes of garbage per second (at 60 fps) in the form of EntityVisitor objects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    private delegate void SpacialItemVisitor(ISpacialItem item);

    protected override void Update(GameTime gameTime)
    {
        m_quadTree.Visit(ref explosionCircle, ApplyExplosionEffects);
    }

    private void ApplyExplosionEffects(ISpacialItem item)
    {
    }

&lt;p&gt;As long as you avoid generating garbage, delegates are fast enough for most purposes.  Because of the hidden dangers, I prefer to avoid them and use interfaces instead.&lt;/p&gt;

It comes down to comparing the time left and productivity you will get from someone excluding the amount of time it takes the additional resources to come up to speed and be productive and subtracting the time invested in teaching them by existing resources. The key factors (in order of significance):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How good the resource is at picking
it up. The best developers can walk
onto a new site and be productive
fixing bugs almost instantly with
little assistance. This skill is
rare but can be learnt. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The segregability of tasks. They need to
be able to work on objects and
functions without tripping over the
existing developers and slowing them
down. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The complexity of the project
and documentation available. If it's
a vanilla best practice ASP.Net
application and common
well-documented business scenarios
then a good developer can just get
stuck in straight away. This factor
more than any will determine how
much time the existing resources
will have to invest in teaching and
therefore the initial negative
impact of the new resources. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The amount of time left. This is often
mis-estimated too. Frequently the
logic will be we only have x weeks
left and it will take x+1 weeks to
get someone up to speed. In reality
the project IS going to slip and
does in fact have 2x weeks of dev
left to go and getting more
resources on sooner rather than
later will help.&lt;/li&gt;

That mean none of the stuff in the Microsoft.Office.Server namespaces is available to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, you can update the User Information List programatically as long as you know the URL to a user's picture.  As long as you're running with some kind of elevated privileges, you should be able to &lt;a href="http://www.sharepointblogs.com/jimyang/archive/2006/12/05/update-wss-3-0-user-profile-programmatically.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;manipulate this list&lt;/a&gt; just like you can with any other SharePoint list.  Keep in mind that this list is only good for the scope of a site collection, so users would have to make this same update all over the place to actually have a photo URL.  Plus users don't get into the User Information List until someone assigns some kind of permission to them, so not every user in your domain will be in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clean way to handle this is definitely the User Profile mechanism is MOSS, but if that's an option the question should really be updated to ask about MOSS vs WSS.&lt;/p&gt;

If a method is invoked and it impossible to do what the method was written to do, throw an Exception. A good example is that constructors always throw ArgumentExceptions if an instance cannot be created using the supplied parameters. Another example is InvalidOperationException, which is thrown when an operation cannot be performed because of the state of another member or members of the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your case, if a method like Login(username, password) is invoked, if the username is not valid, it is indeed correct to throw a UserNameNotValidException, or PasswordNotCorrectException if password is incorrect. The user cannot be logged in using the supplied parameter(s) (i.e. it's impossible because it would violate authentication), so throw an Exception. Although I might have your two Exceptions inherit from ArgumentException.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, if you wish NOT to throw an Exception because a login failure may be very common, one strategy is to instead create a method that returns types that represent different failures. Here's an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{ // class
    ...

    public LoginResult Login(string user, string password)
    {
     if (IsInvalidUser(user))
     {
      return new UserInvalidLoginResult(user);
     }
     else if (IsInvalidPassword(user, password))
     {
      return new PasswordInvalidLoginResult(user, password);
     }
     else
     {
      return new SuccessfulLoginResult();
     }
    }

    ...
}

public abstract class LoginResult
{
    public readonly string Message;

    protected LoginResult(string message)
    {
     this.Message = message;
    }
}

public class SuccessfulLoginResult : LoginResult
{
    public SucccessfulLogin(string user)
     : base(string.Format("Login for user '{0}' was successful.", user))
    { }
}

public class UserInvalidLoginResult : LoginResult
{
    public UserInvalidLoginResult(string user)
     : base(string.Format("The username '{0}' is invalid.", user))
    { }
}

public class PasswordInvalidLoginResult : LoginResult
{
    public PasswordInvalidLoginResult(string password, string user)
     : base(string.Format("The password '{0}' for username '{0}' is invalid.", password, user))
    { }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most developers are taught to avoid Exceptions because of the overhead caused by throwing them. It's great to be resource-conscious, but usually not at the expense of your application design. That is probably the reason you were told not to throw your two Exceptions. Whether to use Exceptions or not usually boils down to how frequently the Exception will occur. If it's a fairly common or an fairly expectable result, this is when most developers will avoid Exceptions and instead create another method to indicate failure, because of the supposed consumption of resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of avoiding using Exceptions in a scenario like just described, using the Try() pattern:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class ValidatedLogin
{
    public readonly string User;
    public readonly string Password;

    public ValidatedLogin(string user, string password)
    {
     if (IsInvalidUser(user))
        {
            throw new UserInvalidException(user);
        }
        else if (IsInvalidPassword(user, password))
        {
            throw new PasswordInvalidException(password);
        }

     this.User = user;
     this.Password = password;
    }

    public static bool TryCreate(string user, string password, out ValidatedLogin validatedLogin)
    {
     if (IsInvalidUser(user) || 
         IsInvalidPassword(user, password))
        {
            return false;
        }

     validatedLogin = new ValidatedLogin(user, password);

     return true;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Used on demand to allocate a block of data for use by the program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can have fragmentation when there are a lot of allocations and deallocations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In C++ data created on the heap will be pointed to by pointers and allocated with new or malloc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can have allocation failures if too big of a buffer is requested to be allocated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You would use the heap if you don't know exactly how much data you will need at runtime or if you need to allocate a lot of data.&lt;/li&gt;

    char buffer[500];

    //Create 500 bytes on the heap

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I'd like to load all posts and it's tags in one query&lt;/strong&gt; but haven't been able to find the right combination of operators. I've been able to load either &lt;em&gt;posts with tags only&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;repeated posts when more than one tag&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the database above, &lt;strong&gt;I'd like to receive three posts and their tags (if any) in a collection property of the Post objects&lt;/strong&gt;. Is it possible at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is designed to be a near drop in replacement for floats/doubles and has a choose-able precision. It does make use of boost to add all the necessary math operator overloads, so you will need that as well (I believe for this it is just a header dependency, not a library dependency).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW, common usage could be something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;typedef Fixed&amp;lt;16, 16&amp;gt; fixed;
fixed f;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only real rule is that the number have to add up to a native size of your system such as 8, 16, 32, 64.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indirect addressing is the name of the code generation technique that allows symbols defined in one file to be referenced from another file, without requiring the referencing file to have explicit knowledge of the layout of the file that defines the symbol. Therefore, the defining file can be modified independently of the referencing file. Indirect addressing minimizes the number of locations that must be modified by the dynamic linker, which facilitates code sharing and improves performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a file uses data that is defined in another file, it creates symbol references. A symbol reference identifies the file from which a symbol is imported and the referenced symbol. There are two types of symbol references: nonlazy and lazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonlazy symbol references are resolved (bound to their definitions) by the dynamic linker when a module is loaded.
A nonlazy symbol reference is essentially a symbol pointera pointer-sized piece of data. The compiler generates nonlazy symbol references for data symbols or function addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lazy symbol references are resolved by the dynamic linker the first time they are used (not at load time). Subsequent calls to the referenced symbol jump directly to the symbols definition.
Lazy symbol references are made up of a symbol pointer and a symbol stub, a small amount of code that directly dereferences and jumps through the symbol pointer. The compiler generates lazy symbol references when it encounters a call to a function defined in another file.&lt;/p&gt;

Over time it seems to have evolved greatly, and with modern trends like LINQ on everyone's tongue it has peaked my interest again, especially now that I know that it is starting to support transparent activation and persistence which intrigue me quite a bit, but a friend posed a very good question to me when I first mentioned db4o and, even with modern innovation, I'm still not sure how to answer it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the best/fastest/most common methods to generate reports similar to the large cross-table complex constraint reports that can be done so effectively on platforms such as SQL? I understand quite well how much time, effort and development time are saved and even many of the performance gains, especially over ORMs, but some applications require complex reports that I'm not sure how to express using objects and object queries and I am also concerned about performance, since it can be overwhelming to optimize and maintain complex reports even on systems designed specifically for that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;
Edit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be more clear, object data sources and the like can be used to pull db4o into the same data-rich controls as SqlDataSource et al. I've been referred to documents on the db4o site about using it with ReportViewer as well as advised to denormalize data into a reporting database, but the question is meant to pose a conceptual challenge on what can be done to accomplish the types of queries that RDBMSs perform so well on that they hold the industry. I love db4o, but I can't think of a truly efficient means of reporting on aggregate data that exists across several different types (or tables in SQL) without pulling all of the relevant objects out of the database, activating them and performing the calculations in application-level code. I may be wrong, but this seems like it couldn't hope to compete with the optimizations possible with an RDBMS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm hoping amongst the bright minds we've managed to gather here that somebody knows something I don't or has innovative ideas for future implementation that could expand the ODBMS arena. I know that various ORMs implement methodologies for complex reporting objects and I'm wondering if anybody with experience with any of these technologies might have something creative that doesn't depend on any technologies outside of my code and db4o (I can generate reports with an SQL server alone).&lt;/p&gt;

When you call a function the arguments to that function plus some other overhead is put on the stack. Some info (such as where to go on return) is also stored there.
When you declare a variable inside your function, that variable is also allocated on the stack. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deallocating the stack is pretty simple because you always deallocate in the reverse order in which you allocate. Stack stuff is added as you enter functions, the corresponding data is removed as you exit them. This means that you tend to stay within a small region of the stack unless you call lots of functions that call lots of other functions (or create a recursive solution).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Heap&lt;/strong&gt;
The heap is a generic name for where you put the data that you create on the fly. If you don't know how many spaceships your program is going to create, you are likely to use the new (or malloc or equivalent) operator to create each spaceship. This allocation is going to stick around for a while, so it is likely we will free things in a different order than we created them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the heap is far more complex, because there end up being regions of memory that are unused interleaved with chunks that are - memory gets fragmented. Finding free memory of the size you need is a difficult problem. This is why the heap should be avoided (though it is still often used).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation&lt;/strong&gt;
Implementation of both the stack and heap is usually down to the runtime / OS. Often games and other applications that are performance critical create their own memory solutions that grab a large chunk of memory from the heap and then dish it out internally to avoid relying on the OS for memory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is only practical if your memory usage is quite different from the norm - i.e for games where you load a level in one huge operation and can chuck the whole lot away in another huge operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical location in memory&lt;/strong&gt;
This is less relevant than you think because of a technology called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory"&gt;Virtual Memory&lt;/a&gt; which makes your program think that you have access to a certain address where the physical data is somewhere else (even on the hard disc!). The addresses you get for the stack are in increasing order as your call tree gets deeper. The addresses for the heap are un-predictable (i.e implimentation specific) and frankly not important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where N = (100 - desired percentile).  So if you wanted all rows in the 90th percentile, you'd select the top 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what you mean by "preferably in a single record".  Do you mean calculate which percentile a given score for a single record would fall into?  e.g. do you want to be able to make statements like "your score is 83, which puts you in the 91st percentile." ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: OK, I thought some more about your question and came up with this interpretation.  Are you asking how to calculate the cutoff score for a particular percentile?  e.g. something like this: to be in the 90th percentile you must have a score greater than 78.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If so, this query works.  I dislike sub-queries though, so depending on what it was for, I'd probably try to find a more elegant solution.  It does, however, return a single record with a single score.&lt;/p&gt;

Why not try setting a breakpoint just after getting a successful return-code from OpenClipboard() and step through your code.  According to the Internet it may work on your system, but of course, not on mine, thanks for trying.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Googling on e.g. (( OpenClipboard 1418 vc6 )) finds articles like "GetClipboardData fails in debugger" and "No Error in VC++6 but Error in VC++ 2005".  Pragmatically for-the-moment, problem solved - I simply cannot set breakpoints within such code, I need to squirrel information and set the breakpoint after the clipboard operations are done.  Error 1418 is "Thread does not have a clipboard open" but it works fine as long as you don't step with VS.NET, or like I say if you keep breakpoints outside of the clipboard-open-close-block.&lt;p&gt;
I would feel better knowing what the exact issue is with the VS.NET debugger.&lt;p&gt;
Being a C++ person I am only dimly aware that you are not supposed to think in terms of threads when doing dot-Net.  Anyway I did not find a guru-quality explanation of what's really going on, whether in-fact the problem is that the dot-Net debugger is subtly interfering with the thread-information somehow, when you single-step thru native C++ code.  &lt;P&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;System-wise:  about a year old, two dual-core Xeon's, 4 CPU's according to XP-pro.
  I had just finished debugging the code by single-stepping thru it in vc6 under XP-SP2-32-bit.  So I know the code was pretty-much-fine under vc6.  However when I tested with a 10-megabyte CF_TEXT I got exceptions.  I thought to try debugging under the nicer exception model of XP-x64.&lt;p&gt;
Recompiled with visual-studio-2008, I could not get the code to single-step at all.  OpenClipboard worked, but EnumClipboardFormats() did not work, nothing worked when single-stepped.  However, when I set the breakpoint below the complete block of code, everything worked fine.  And &lt;em&gt;YES&lt;/em&gt; vc2008 made a pinpoint diagnostic 'stack frame corruption around szBuf.  There is a lot to like about vc2008.  It would be nice if this were somehow merely a clipboard problem - without knowing that I would feel compelled to worry about stepping thru ANYTHING, whether thread-context-issues might be due to the dot-Net-debugger.&lt;/p&gt;

It's the region of memory below the stack pointer register, which can be set as needed.  The stack is also used for passing arguments to subroutines, and also for preserving the values in registers before calling subroutines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The heap is a portion of memory that is given to an application by the operating system, typically through a syscall like malloc.  On modern OSes this memory is a set of pages that only the calling process has access to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The size of the stack is determined at runtime, and generally does not grow after the program launches.  In a C program, the stack needs to be large enough to hold every variable declared within each function.  The heap will grow dynamically as needed, but the OS is ultimately making the call (it will often grow the heap by more than the value requested by malloc, so that at least some future mallocs won't need to go back to the kernel to get more memory.  This behavior is often customizable)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you've allocated the stack before launching the program, you never need to malloc before you can use the stack, so that's a slight advantage there.  In practice, it's very hard to predict what will be fast and what will be slow in modern operating systems that have virtual memory subsystems, because how the pages are implemented and where they are stored is an implementation detail.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a really insecure way to hash passwords. You &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; want to do this. If you want to know why read the &lt;a href="http://www.openbsd.org/papers/bcrypt-paper.pdf"&gt;Bycrypt Paper&lt;/a&gt; by the guys who did the password hashing system for OpenBSD. Additionally if want a good discussion on how passwords are broken check out &lt;a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/columnists/388"&gt;this interview&lt;/a&gt; with the author of Jack the Ripper (the popular unix password cracker).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now B-Crypt is great but I have to admit I don't use this system because I didn't have the EKS-Blowfish algorithm available and did not want to implement it my self. I use a slightly updated version of the FreeBSD system which I will post below. The gist is this. Don't just hash the password. Salt the password then hash the password and repeat 10,000 or so times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that didn't make sense here is the code: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#note I am using the Python Cryptography Toolkit
from Crypto.Hash import SHA256

HASH_REPS = 50000

def __saltedhash(string, salt):
    sha256 = SHA256.new()
    sha256.update(string)
    sha256.update(salt)
    for x in xrange(HASH_REPS): 
        sha256.update(sha256.digest())
        if x % 10: sha256.update(salt)
    return sha256

def saltedhash_bin(string, salt):
    """returns the hash in binary format"""
    return __saltedhash(string, salt).digest()

def saltedhash_hex(string, salt):
    """returns the hash in hex format"""
    return __saltedhash(string, salt).hexdigest()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For deploying a system like this the key thing to consider is the HASH_REPS constant. This is the scalable cost factor in this system. You will need to do testing to determine what is the exceptable amount of time you want to wait for each hash to be computed versus the  risk of an offline dictionary based attack on your password file. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security is hard, and the method I present is not the best way to do this, but it is significantly better than a simple hash. Additionally it is dead simple to implement. So even you don't choose a more complex solution this isn't the worst out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hope this helps,

I've been using jEdit for years, which is a uber-powerful text editor.  It has syntax highlighting, but it doesn't have any language-specific features like code completion and intelligent refactoring.  I'm finding that's hindering my productivity.  I &lt;em&gt;desperately&lt;/em&gt; want to like Eclipse.  I really do.  But I keep running into problem after problem.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now that Eclipse can use an ant script to build, instead of just creating its own build environment from an ant script then ignoring any changes to it, I found some online guides and set it up.  It doesn't seem ready for prime time, though.  My ant script builds fine from the command line, but I get all these build errors because I need to tell Eclipse all this stuff the build.xml already has in it, like the CLASSPATH, and where external jars are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I leave Eclipse running for too long, or sometimes after my laptop wakes up from hibernate, the UI starts breaking.  For instance, the tabs on the editor pane disappear, so I can only edit one file at a time, and it doesn't say which one it is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have faced several instances where classes weren't rebuilt that should have been, leading to inaccurate line numbers in debugging walkthroughs and other unpredictable behavior (this isn't just me; the two other developers trying it out with me are seeing the same thing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I find it a huge hassle that the workspace is in a different place than my source code.  I have other files I need to edit (xml files, etc), and for each directory I want to edit files in, I need to set up a special entry, and it doesn't even default to where my source code is when setting that up.&lt;/li&gt;

They are cheap, there are several suppliers since the hardware is open source (although the name isn't), the IDE is free, you program them in C, and they're easy to hook up to just about anything. The board has 12 digital I/O pins (two of which double as serial communication pins) and six 12-bit A/D converter I/O pins (which can also be configured as digital pins). It can handle pulse-width modulation (PWM) for motor and servo control, interrupts, I2C interfaces, and most boards can either run standalone or off the USB port. Communication to the computer is handled by an FTDI serial USB driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Sparkfun.com, also check out &lt;a href="http://www.adafruit.com/"&gt;www.adafruit.com&lt;/a&gt; for some cheap, small USB "Boarduino" boards and several nice prototyping shields for the full-sized Arduino.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main Arduino site (&lt;a href="http://arduino.cc/"&gt;Arduino.cc&lt;/a&gt;) has pretty much every reference and tutorial you need to get started. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the "Hello, World!" of Arduino programming as an example of how easy it is. The program blinks an LED attached to digital pin 13:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int ledPin = 13;                 // LED connected to digital pin 13

void setup()
{
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);      // sets the digital pin as output
}

void loop()
{
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);   // sets the LED on
  delay(1000);                  // waits for a second
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);    // sets the LED off
  delay(1000);                  // waits for a second
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically every Arduino program has a setup() function that runs when the power is applied or the board is reset and a loop() function that runs forever. Of course, you also have timers and interrupt functions, or your can use the loop() for polling inputs and then call out to other functions. The Arduino IDE sits on top of GCC and uses the same libraries and includes that you would use if you were writing a barebones program for the Atmega microcontroller. This means that (a) it hides the hard parts as long as you want it to (bootloaders, fuses, etc.), (b) you can get to the internals of the program if you want to, and (c) you can utilize a large selection of libraries that are out there for this family of microcontrollers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One of the things I've noticed with
  using mocker is that it's easier to
  write the application code first and
  then go back and write the tests
  second, since most of the time I'm
  mocking many method calls and the
  syntax to write the mocked calls is
  much more verbose (thus harder to
  write) than the application code. It's
  easier to write the app code and then
  model the test code off of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, its easier because you are just testing that the sky is orange after you made it orange by painting it with a specific kind of brush. 
This is retrofitting tests (for self-assurance). Mocks are good but you should know how and when to use them - Like the saying goes 'When you have a hammer everything looks like a nail' It's also easy to write a whole load of unreadable and not-as-helpful-as-can-be  tests. The time spent understanding what the test is about is time lost that can be used to fix broken ones. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the point is: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html#ClassicalAndMockistTesting"&gt;Mocks aren't stubs - Martin Fowler&lt;/a&gt; if you haven't already. Google out some documented instances of good &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/ModelViewPresenter.html"&gt;ModelViewPresenter&lt;/a&gt; patterned GUIs (Fake/Mock out the UIs if necessary). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study your options and choose wisely. I'll play the guy with the halo on your left shoulder in white saying 'Don't do it.' Read this question as to &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/59195/how-are-mocks-meant-to-be-used"&gt;my reasons&lt;/a&gt; -  St. Justin  is on your right shoulder. I believe he has also something to say:) &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with making my own perl RPM that installed perl into a different location, like &lt;code&gt;/opt/&lt;/code&gt;. This was pretty straight forward. I mostly started with this because I didn't want the system utilities that used perl to break when I upgraded/installed new modules. I had to modify all my scripts to specify &lt;code&gt;#!/opt/bin/perl&lt;/code&gt; at the top and sometimes I even played with the path to make sure my perl came first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I grabbed a mod_perl source RPM and modified it to use my &lt;code&gt;/opt/bin/perl&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/perl&lt;/code&gt;. I don't have access to the changes I made, since it was at a different gig. It took me a bit of playing around to get it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It did work, but I'm not an RPM wizard, so dependency checking didn't work out so well. For example, I could uninstall my custom RPM and break everything. It wasn't a big deal for me, so I moved on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also mixing RPM's with CPAN installs of modules (did I mention we built our own custom CPAN mirror with our own code?). This was a bit fragile too. Again, I didn't have the resources (ie, time) to figure out how to bend &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cpan2rpm/" rel="nofollow"&gt;cpan2rpm&lt;/a&gt; to use my perl and not cause RPM conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had it all to do again, I would make a custom 5.10 perl RPM and just replace the system perl. Then I would use &lt;code&gt;cpan2rpm&lt;/code&gt; to create the RPM packages I needed for my software and compile my own mod_perl RPM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/79461/vertical-alignment-of-elements-in-a-div#79550"&gt;fd has described&lt;/a&gt; the steps for absolute positioning, as well as adjusting the display of the &lt;code&gt;H1&lt;/code&gt; element such that images will appear inline with it. To that, i'll add that you can align the images by use of the &lt;code&gt;vertical-align&lt;/code&gt; style:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#header h1 { display: inline; }
#header img { vertical-align: middle; }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...this would put the header and images together, with top edges aligned. Other alignment options exist; &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#propdef-vertical-align"&gt;see the documentation&lt;/a&gt;. You might also find it beneficial to drop the DIV and move the images inside the &lt;code&gt;H1&lt;/code&gt; element - this provides semantic value to the container, and removes the need to adjust the display of the &lt;code&gt;H1&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say they do have a lot to do with performance at runtime, in many cases.  Even if you called the framework, and it directly called the API call (in which case there would be no point, but this is the best possible case for speed), there would still be the performance penalty for an extra function call, which can be significant at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I have to admit, wish respect to the original poster, Vista &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a step backwords.  It is slow due to things like DRM that are not "features".  Windows XP was actually faster than windows 2000 in many respects.  Vista certainly is not. &lt;/p&gt;

On second reading I'm a little confused, you seem to want to mix the class into module, which is porbably not so advisable.  Also is the YAML supposed to load an array of the SizeSpecifications?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears to be that you're not mixing the Module into your class.  If I run the test in irb then the require throws a LoadError. So I assume you've put two files together, if not dump it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally you'd write the functionality in the module, then mix that into the class.  so you may modify your code like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class SizeSpecification
  include SomeModule
  def fits?     
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which will allow you to then say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SizeSpecification::SomeModule.sizes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you should also be able to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SizeSpecification.sizes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However that requires you to take the self off the prefix of the sizes method definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does that help?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stack and heap need not be singular.  A common situation in which you have more than one stack is if you have more than one thread in a process.  In this case each thread has its own stack.  You can also have more than one heap, for example some DLL configurations can result in different DLLs allocating from different heaps, which is why it's generally a bad idea to release memory allocated by a different library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In C you can get the benefit of variable length allocation through the use of alloca, which allocates on the stack, as opposed to alloc, which allocates on the heap.  This memory won't survive your return statement, but it's useful for a scratch buffer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On windows making a huge temporary buffer that you don't use much of is not free. This is because the compiler will generate a stack probe loop that is called every time your function is entered to make sure the stack exists (because windows uses a single guard page at the end of your stack to detect when it needs to grow the stack, if you access memory more than one page off the end of the stack you will crash).  Example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;void myfunction()
{
   char big[10000000];
   // do something that only uses for first 1K of big 99% of the time.
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Shift + [navigate with arrow keys, Home/End, or PgUp/PgDn] - Select text between the caret's previous and new positions.  Continue to hold Shift and navigate to select more text.&lt;/li&gt;

Almost always the answers are things "ease of editing", "multiple contributors", and "Word is to heavyweight".  &lt;em&gt;Very&lt;/em&gt; rarely have we seen anyone ask for what I consider to be uniquely wiki-like features (special "magic" markup, fine grained version history showing changes, etc).  Also, they usually want some kind of categorization of things, not just completely free-form pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the SharePoint world these things should scream "list" at you if you've been working with the tool for a while.  There is basically no particular reason to use a wiki for these knowledge base-style applications, especially since "ease of editing" usually directly conflicts with the idea of learning a special markup language for most user.  Through a couple of rich-text columns in there, and you're all set.  If you really don't like the built-in rich-text editor (yes the image uploading process is clunky and it doesn't work in Firefox), have someone in your organization go drop the 8 Benjamins and go get the &lt;a href="http://www.telerik.com/products/sharepoint/radeditor.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;RadEditor for SharePoint&lt;/a&gt;.  It should pretty much handle those concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally once we've gotten over the "but it needs to be a wiki" dogma, we've had pretty good customer reception to just using lists.  In some cases, where a little more of a page templating facility was required we turned to using the WCM features of MOSS, which requires a little more up-front thought about templates, but also has a better out of the box experience for things like content snippets and image handling.&lt;/p&gt;

When a function is called, a block is reserved on the top of the stack for local variables and some bookkeeping data.  When that function returns, the block becomes unused and can be used the next time a function is called.  The stack is always reserved in a LIFO (last in first out) order; the most recently reserved block is always the next block to be freed.  This makes it really simple to keep track of the stack; freeing a block from the stack is nothing more than adjusting one pointer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The heap is memory set aside for dynamic allocation.  Unlike the stack, there's no enforced pattern to the allocation and deallocation of blocks from the heap; you can allocate a block at any time and free it at any time.  This makes it much more complex to keep track of which parts of the heap are allocated or free at any given time; there are many custom heap allocators available to tune heap performance for different usage patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each thread gets a stack, while there's typically only one heap for the application (although it isn't uncommon to have multiple heaps for different types of allocation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer your questions directly:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To what extent are they controlled by the OS or language runtime?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OS allocates the stack for each system-level thread when the thread is created.  Typically the OS is called by the language runtime to allocate the heap for the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is their scope?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stack is attached to a thread, so when the thread exits the stack is reclaimed.  The heap is typically allocated at application startup by the runtime, and is reclaimed when the application (technically process) exits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What determines the size of each of them?&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The size of the stack is set when a thread is created.  The size of the heap is set on application startup, but can grow as space is needed (the allocator requests more memory from the operating system).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What makes one faster?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stack is faster because the access pattern makes it trivial to allocate and deallocate memory from it (a pointer/integer is simply incremented or decremented), while the heap has much more complex bookkeeping involved in an allocation or free.  Also, each byte in the stack tends to be reused very frequently which means it tends to be mapped to the processor's cache, making it very fast. Another performance hit for the heap is that the heap, being mostly a global resource, typically has to be multi-threading safe, i.e. each allocation and deallocation needs to be - typically - synchronized with "all" other heap accesses in the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clear demonstration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Virtual hosts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most likely you will want to do &lt;a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/vhosts/examples.html"&gt;name-based virtual hosts&lt;/a&gt;, as it's easiest to set up and only requires one IP address (so will also be easy to set up and test on your local MAMP machine). IP-based virtual hosts is better in some other respects, but you have to have an IP address for each domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_hosting"&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; discusses the differences and links to a good basic walk-thru of how to do name-based vhosts at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On your local machine for testing, you'll also have to set up fake DNS names in /etc/hosts for your fake test domain names. i.e. if you have Apache listening on localhost and set up vhost1.test.domain and vhost2.test.domain in your Apache configs, you'd just add these domains to the 127.0.0.1 line in /etc/hosts, after localhost:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1 localhost vhost1.test.domain vhost2.test.domain
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you've done the /etc/hosts edit and added the name-based virtual host configs to your Apache configuration file(s), that's it, restart Apache and your test domains should work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Redirect with mod_rewrite&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to do redirects with mod_rewrite (so that user.example.com isn't directly hosted and instead redirects to example.com/user), then you will also need to do a RewriteCond to match the subdomain and redirect it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^subdomain\.example\.com
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://example.com/subdomain$1 [R]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can put this in a .htaccess or in your main Apache config.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need to add a pair of rules like the last two for each subdomain you want to redirect. Or, you may be able to capture the subdomain in a RewriteCond to be able to use one wildcard rule to redirect *.example.com to example.com/
* -- but that smells really bad to me from a security standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;All together, vhosts and redirect&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's better to be more explicit and set up a virtual host configuration section for each hostname you want to listen for, and put the rewrite rules for each of these hostnames inside its virtual host config. (It is always more secure and faster to put this kind of stuff inside your Apache config and not .htaccess, if you can help it -- .htaccess slows performance because Apache is constantly scouring the filesystem for .htaccess files and reparsing them, and it's less secure because these can be screwed up by users.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All together like that, the vhost config inside your Apache configs would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;NameVirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80

# Your "default" configuration must go first
&amp;lt;VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80&amp;gt;
  ServerName example.com
  ServerAlias www.example.com
  DocumentRoot /www/siteroot
  # etc.
&amp;lt;/VirtualHost&amp;gt;

# First subdomain you want to redirect
&amp;lt;VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80&amp;gt;
  ServerName vhost1.example.com
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://example.com/vhost1$1 [R]
&amp;lt;/VirtualHost&amp;gt;

# Second subdomain you want to redirect
&amp;lt;VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80&amp;gt;
  ServerName vhost2.example.com
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://example.com/vhost2$1 [R]
&amp;lt;/VirtualHost&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

  firsthour = user.firsthour
  lasthour = user.lasthour

  firstminutes = 4 - (rounded down integer(user.firstminutes/15))
  lastminutes = rounded down integer(user.lastminutes/15)

  timetable(lasthour) = timetable(lasthour) + lastminutes

  for index=firsthour+1 to lasthour-1
    timetable(index) = timetable(index) + 4
  next index

next user
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the timetable array holds the values you desire in 15 minute granularity, ie. a value of 4 = 1 hour, 5 = 1 hour 15 minutes, 14 = 3 hours 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One detail that has been missed, however, is that the "heap" should in fact probably be called the "free store".  The reason for this distinction is that the original free store was implemented with a data structure known as a "binomial heap."  For that reason, allocating from early implementations of malloc()/free() was allocation from a heap.  However, in this modern day, most free stores are implemented with very elaborate data structures that are not binomial heaps.&lt;/p&gt;

The mailing list (and the book) both have a preference for Template::Toolkit (as do I), and DBIx::Class (we continue to use Class::DBI), but you can use pretty much anything you like. Catalyst is marvelously agnostic that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't be put off by the fact Catalyst seems to require half of CPAN as dependencies. Once you get it up and running, it is a well-oiled machine. It has reached a level of maturity now that once you come to grips with it, you find it 'fades into the background'. You spend your time solving business needs, not fighting with the tools you use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does what it says on the tin. Catalyst++&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In low-memory environments, leaving that flag off would favor reduced memory usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When should you enable this mode? It doesn't matter, because as far as I can tell, there is no code anywhere in COM that changes its behavior based on whether the process has been placed into this mode! It looks like the flag was added when DCOM was introduced, but it never got hooked up to anything. (Or whatever code that had been hooked up to it never shipped.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is business use, planning on growing to 5-10 TB over next few years. Our facility is almost 24 hours a day, six days a week. We could have 15-30 minutes of downtime, but we want to minimize data loss. I want to minimize 3 AM calls. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are currently running one server with ZFS on Solaris and we are looking at AVS for the HA part, but we have had minor issues with Solaris (CIFS implementation doesn't work with Vista, etc) that have held us up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;DRDB over GFS (GFS for distributed
lock capability)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gluster (needs
    client pieces, no native CIFS
    support?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows DFS (doc says only
    replicates after file closes?)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We currently snapshot the data in ZFS and send the snapshot over the net to a remote datacenter for offsite backup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our original plan was to have a 2nd machine and rsync every 10 - 15 min. The issue on a failure would be that ongoing production processes would lose 15 minutes of data and be left "in the middle". They would almost be easier to start from the beginning than to figure out where to pickup in the middle. That is what drove us to look at HA solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

That difference is very important. Often, the current scope &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the current object, but sometimes (especially in the case of a closure or an anonymous callback function) the function is executed in the global scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few ways to deal with this. If you have control over when your function is called, you can use the &lt;code&gt;call()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;apply()&lt;/code&gt; methods to execute the function in a specific scope. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var myObject = {
  hello: function () {
    alert('hello!');
  }
}

function foo() {
  this.hello();
}

foo(); // error, since this === window (if executed in a browser)
foo.call(myObject); // works, since this === myObject
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your sample, you appear to be using the YUI Connection library, which accepts an object (not a function) as the third argument. The following example will make an &lt;code&gt;asyncRequest()&lt;/code&gt; call that executes the callback in a specific scope:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;YAHOO.util.Connect.asyncRequest('GET', '/foo', {
  scope  : myObject,
  success: function () {
    this.hello(); // works because this === myObject
  }

&lt;p&gt;If you don't want to do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; complicated in your build process, sure: use EUMM.  But if you have a build problem on a different target platform, you might end up in the Makefile, which is different on every variation of make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Module::Build gives you lots of features (anything you can think of if you extend it) and is all perl so you never end up debugging a makefile.  Module::Install gives you features, but you have to bundle it and everything ends up running through 'make' in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build Agents. It's very simple to turn any box into a build machine and run a build on it. MSFT got this one right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reporting. All relevant build results (test included) are stored in a SQL database and reported on via SQL Server Reporting Services. This is an immensely powerful tool for charting build and test results over time. CC Net doesn't have this built in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can do similar customizations via MSBUILD. It's basically the same as using NAnt with CC Net&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To build C++/CLI projects (or run unit tests...?) the build agent must have VSTS Dev or Team Suite installed. This, friends, is just batsh*t crazy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It must be connected to the TFS Mothership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're a leaner shop, stick with CC Net and grow your own reporting solutions. That's what we did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;College provides you with a tool box full of tools.  This is a screwdriver, that is a crescent wrench.  You MIGHT get to use each tool once in college.  It is when you enter the real world is when you really find out what you have.  You sort out the useful ones from the rest, which ones you want to leave at home on the workbench, just in case, and the ones you keep in your pocket every day.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tqm, Iso, Cmm, Agile, etc.  These are all fads they will come and they will go, none of the successful ones are more than just common sense.  All successful engineers and companies use some flavor of common sense, that is what made them successful, few needed a name for it.  The problem is you cannot sell common sense, a manager cannot prove their value to the company by training and buying common sense without a catchy name.  Put a name on it that their superiors have read in some news article or magazine and the manager keeps their job and you keep yours.  Very few of the companies that claim to follow these practices actually do.  Most write a check to a consultant, and get their annual and or lifetime certificate to some club so that they can put a graphic on their website or a label on the box their product comes in.  Many will argue that this is rare...been there, seen it, it happens.  This is all part of business, you have to cut corners sometimes to stay profitable and keep the doors open and the lights on.  The hardcore followers of all of these practices have all argued that the last one was a fad and this one isnt, the last one really was too expensive to follow, this one isnt.  The last one was fake you just hired a consultant, this one is real.  Like programming languages, these too will evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your ability to understand the realities of business, the university system, and your role in it is the key.  Like anything in life, choose your battles.  Its not the university or the business or the government or anyone else's job to teach you want you need or want to know.  It is your job to look out for number one.  Likewise you cant blame anyone else for providing you the time to do this, you have to do it.  You will fall off the horse, you are not a victim, get up and get back on, no excuses, life is not fair deal with it.  Do take advantage of handouts, dont pretend to be independent.  And certainly pay your dues, dont suck a company dry of handouts, without giving them something (your best at the time?) in return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do people think cmm or agile or any of the others is a fad?  Why do they think they are not?  Why did the professor teach you program that way?  To avoid gotos or to avoid constants or to avoid this and that?  Is it because it produces more reliable code?  Better performing code?  Reduces human error?  Or is it because it is easier to grade papers/programs giving them more time to do research?  Is it because they dont know how to program and they are just following someone elses book on the subject?  Did they teach you that you cannot have maintainable, reliable, high performance code?  You cannot even "choose any two" maintainable interferes both with reliable and high performance?  Sometimes you sacrifice reliability for performance.  Sometimes you dont care about reliability or performance, you just want to get from version 117.34.2 of yet another accounting software program to version 118.0.0.  Your business model is from selling version upgrades and tech support and as far as software developers any old robot will do that can write the same code in the same way.  Replace the burnt out one with the fresh out of college one and keep selling upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no universal answers to these questions, you have to find out what your opinion is, live with it and defend it.  Change your mind, live with it, and defend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question everything...will I really get burned if I touch the hot pot on the stove?  Will the psychological effects of being afraid cause more damage than just getting burned?  Is there a safe way to test the answer without getting hurt?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I could afford it I would buy and eventually melt down transistors, caps, resistors, etc in my dorm room, all of which have a distinctive bad odor.   It is far cheaper and easier to just buy an amp for your stereo than trying to build one the day after your first transistor class.  Linus being the exception of course its easier to just buy an operating system than write one...You can get more done although what you learn in that time is different than what Linus learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world inside and outside the university will adopt these formulas (cmm, agile, etc) for solving problems and when the next one comes out they will drop them just as fast.  You dont have to use version control to be successful, there are just as many successes with as without (well actually because of the age of the industry there are many more successes without version control thus far). Likewise you can be successful with minimal testing (look at the really big names in the computer industry as examples).  You can be successful by testing your own code, as well as being successful by following the rule that you should never test your own code.  You can be successful using emacs and you can be successful using vi.  You have to decide what mix works for you and if you are lucky find a place to work that agrees with you.  With time what works for you will change, from tools to languages to programming style to fears, version control, documentation, etc.  You will get married and have children and decide you might want to hide in the corner of that big company with the big health insurance package with the boring job and enjoy your kids instead of being the hotshot programmer at the small startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you get out of college and into the real world, listen to and work with and argue with the "old timers".  They have decades to centuries of combined experience, traps they have fallen into that you might avoid and or test on your own (maybe you realize you dont have to touch the hot pot to find out it will burn you).  Most will have seen at least one or two of these fads come and go, and in particular how badly they were burned, and what they did to recover from it.  They know many different ways to test things, and the names of the testing styles that have come and gone as well.  What works, what doesnt.  Where the risk is and how to avoid wasting time on a tangent.  As you mature and you become the old timer, pass it forward.  Pay for what you learned by trying to teach those that follow you.  Remember to teach them HOW to fish, dont just give them a fish.  And sometimes you have to let them fail before they will succeed, keep them from getting burned too badly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I really wanted to say here is right now we are in a rare situation where we can witness an evolution of a parallel universe (and perhaps influence it).  Yes computer science is a young science compared to say physics.  But at the same time it has evolved many times over.  Depending  on where you work and who you work with you may be able to observe hardware engineers.  Programming languages in the hardware world is certainly not new, but it has not evolved as quickly as the software world.  Software had a few decades head start.  Hardware has always thought of software engineers as second class citizens.  Our job is easy, their job is hard.  (Note I am actually both a hardware and software engineer).  What is interesting is that right now they are still dealing with what we would consider elementary or infantile problems.  Why would I need to use version control, I am the only one working on this chip.  Your experience with gcc  or other cheap compilers or free IDEs cant possibly compare with the expensive tools I use, if the company thought you were worthy enough to use it or even know how to use it they would buy you a copy.  And a long list of other excuses.  I had the pleasure of learning both vhdl and verilog and becoming productive in both within a week from what was almost a dare from such a hardware engineer (despite my diploma saying electrical engineer my job title is software engineer).  I wanted to learn these languages, when the tools were available to me I stayed at the office into the night and taught myself.  From that point on that engineer in particular realized that what I was saying was true, languages are just syntax, programming fundamentals are the same, the tools all do the same thing.  Its apples and apples not apples and oranges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general though it is still difficult to send the message that one of these two parallel industries has a lot more experience in languages, programming habits, source control, testing, tools, programming environments, etc than the other.  The problem I am trying to solve is taking the hardware designs as they are being developed, create affordable functional simulators that we can tie in with a simulation (virtual machine) of the processor so that we can start testing the hardware and developing the test and deliverable software long before we go to silicon.  No there is nothing "new" about this, but we have no mechanism to get the latest code, track changes in the code to see where we need to focus our time.  No mechanism for tracking the documentation defining the user (programming) interface to the hardware.  The one golden copy is in someone's email inbox in binary form and only changes when, well it doesnt you have to read the verilog to find out what is going on. Wait, that verilog is how old?  That bug I spent all week on you figured out three weeks ago and fixed?  So do we just fly to some vacation spot and party for six months waiting for the hardware folks to finish their task and throw it over the wall to us, or do we take this opportunity to try to be patient and optimistic and teach them that they there are common sense methods that are not that intrusive that allow them to both do their job, backup their work as well as share their stuff for peer review...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that hardware engineers did leave college with a box of shiny new tools just like you did.  You learned 17 different programming languages of which you may only use one, the rest of the languages you in your career will be invented after you leave college.  When they left college they can tell you what they know about calculus and the theory of relativity how many electrons are in each of the elements and compute the charge around a Gaussian surface.  But the bulk of their career is one, zero, and, or and not (hey we have those in common, all you really need to know about computers, one, zero, and, or and not hardware or software engineer).  Granted the fundamental laws of physics, calculus, electrons are not going to change as fast as programming languages do.  But the fundamentals of programming are the same across all languages and will continue to be into the future.  Did you leave college knowing that or did you leave thinking java is different and better than C++ because this and that and the other?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any other business the universities job is to stay profitable.  They have to hire the right academics to bring both the right students and the right research dollars and the right kinds of research to make the university profitable.  They have to offer the right classes to bring the right students and produce the right graduates so that as the decades pass employers both near the university and hopefully far away will recognize that this university produces productive and profitable employees. (yes and sometimes you have to attract the right athletes in the right sport to get the right amount of TV time and the right amount of name recognition and sports revenue).  Some universities will teach C++ and Java, some never will.  Some will invent CMM, and some will teach Agile, some will do neither.  If the university has any value at all there is something there for you to learn.  They will not teach you everything there is to learn, but they will have something useful.  Learn that something while you are there, collect a reasonable number of various forms of tools in your tool box.  Leave the university and get a job.  If your toolbox sucks maybe find another university and never mention the first.  If it is an ok tool box use those tools and build some new ones on your own time.  If its a pretty good tool box, say good things about that university and the good academics you learned this and that from and pay the school back for what they gave you.  Even though you didnt get every possible tool in the universal catalogue of university tools you will walk away with a certain subset.  Even if you dont graduate...&lt;/p&gt;

While that's not exactly new you can introduce novelty by using higher abstraction that UI building blocks. E.g. have a "Scale Question block", Users would specify the scale (e.g. 1-10) and the questions and you build the matrix. Also the results could be defined cross-checked. E.g. "How probable is it that a user selected X in question 6 when they selected Y in question 5".
Then run that app to rate the courses at your institute.

VxWorks uses &lt;strong&gt;priority-based scheduling&lt;/strong&gt; by default. So in your case, since T1 and T2 have the same priority, whichever one gets the CPU first will continue to run indefinitely until it is explicitly blocked (using &lt;em&gt;taskSuspend&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;taskDelay&lt;/em&gt;), at which time the other READY task will execute until it is blocked, and so on. This ought to be controlled by semaphores or mutexes (mutices?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main problem with priority-based scheduling is illuminated by this exact problem. How do we determine how long to let these tasks run? The fact that they have the same priority complicates things. Another concern is that VxWorks tasks that have high priority (lower number means higher priority) can preempt your application which you must be prepared for in your code. These problems can be solved by using &lt;strong&gt;round-robin scheduling&lt;/strong&gt;.

It would open up a vast number of possibilities. For example, you would be able to introduce kids to programming by showing them graphs. That would be a fairly easy demo. You could have a separate "execute window" where all the I/O goes on. You could then manipulate the node definitions to show the flow of instructions. It would be even more neat if this tool kit was free (as in speech), and others could adopt it! It would be trivial for anyone who was a decent client-side web programmer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DRBD allows you to create networked block devices.  Think RAID 1 across two servers instead of just two disks.  DRBD deployments are usually done using Heartbeat for failover in case one system dies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure about load balancing, but you might investigate and see if LVS can be used to load balance across your DRBD hosts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to use SSIS as we have SQL 2005 servers I can run the process from. I have a fair bit of SQL experience, but not much with SSIS. I have been trying to do this with the "Transfer Database Task" but haven't been having much luck, as it always throws an error. &lt;/p&gt;

A Single SSIS "Transfer Database Task" with the following properties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Destination Overwrite: True &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Action: Copy &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sure there is something obvious going on here, but surely if the task is set to overwrite the pre-existance of the role shouldn't matter? Does anyone know what I need to do to get this working?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wanted to roll your own, what I've done in the past was to instead of using List for my collections, I've used a custom type derived from BindingList.  Inhereting from BindingList allows you to override the behaviour of add/remove item.  So you can for example have another internal collection of "delteted" items.  Every time the overriden Remove method is called on your collection, put the item into the "deleted" collection, and then call the base implementation of the Remove method.  You can do the same for added items or changed items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't wind up using his union representation for fixed-point numbers though.  I mostly have experience with fixed-point in C, so I haven't had the option to use a class either.  For the most part though, I think that defining your number of fraction bits in a macro and using descriptive variable names makes this fairly easy to work with.  Also, I've found that it is best to have macros or functions for multiplication and especially division, or you quickly get unreadable code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, with 24.8 values:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; #include "stdio.h"

/* Declarations for fixed point stuff */

typedef int int_fixed;

#define FRACT_BITS 8
#define FIXED_POINT_ONE (1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; FRACT_BITS)
#define MAKE_INT_FIXED(x) ((x) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; FRACT_BITS)
#define MAKE_FLOAT_FIXED(x) ((int_fixed)((x) * FIXED_POINT_ONE))
#define MAKE_FIXED_INT(x) ((x) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; FRACT_BITS)
#define MAKE_FIXED_FLOAT(x) (((float)(x)) / FIXED_POINT_ONE)

#define FIXED_MULT(x, y) ((x)*(y) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; FRACT_BITS)
#define FIXED_DIV(x, y) (((x)&amp;lt;&amp;lt;FRACT_BITS) / (y))

/* tests */
int main()
{
    int_fixed fixed_x = MAKE_FLOAT_FIXED( 4.5f );
    int_fixed fixed_y = MAKE_INT_FIXED( 2 );

    int_fixed fixed_result = FIXED_MULT( fixed_x, fixed_y );
    printf( "%.1f\n", MAKE_FIXED_FLOAT( fixed_result ) );

    fixed_result = FIXED_DIV( fixed_result, fixed_y );
    printf( "%.1f\n", MAKE_FIXED_FLOAT( fixed_result ) );

    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which writes out &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
9.0
4.5
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that there are all kinds of integer overflow issues with those macros, I just wanted to keep the macros simple.  This is just a quick and dirty example of how I've done this in C.  In C++ you could make something a lot cleaner using operator overloading.  Actually, you could easily make that C code a lot prettier too...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess this is a long-winded way of saying: I think it's OK to use a typedef and macro approach.  So long as you're clear about what variables contain fixed point values it isn't too hard to maintain, but it probably won't be as pretty as a C++ class.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I was in your position, I would try to get some profiling numbers to show where the bottlenecks are.  If there are relatively few of them then go with a typedef and macros.  If you decide that you need a global replacement of all floats with fixed-point math though, then you'll probably be better off with a class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// here's our active element.
var $active = $('#active');

// here is the filter we'll be testing against.
var filter = "img.a";

// $all will be the final jQuery object with all the consecutively matched elements.
// start it out by populating it with the current object.
var $all = $active;

for ($curr = $active.prev(filter); $curr.length &amp;gt; 0; $curr = $curr.prev(filter)) {
    $all = $all.add($curr);
}
for ($curr = $td.next(filter); $curr.length &amp;gt; 0; $curr = $curr.next(filter)) {
    $all = $all.add($curr);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a follow up question, I could see how this could easily be generalised by making it into a function which takes two arguments: an initial element, and a filter string - can anyone point me in the right direction to find out how to extend the jQuery object to add such a function?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;: I've since found that the each() function would do this rather well for some purposes. In my own case it doesn't work as cleanly, since I want a single jQuery object for all those elements, but here's how you could use each for a different purpose (hiding consecutive ".a" elements, in this example:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$('#active')
    .nextAll()
    .each(hideConsecutive)
    .end()
    .prevAll()
    .each(hideConsecutive)
;
function hideConsecutive(index, element) {
    var $e = $(element);
    if (!$e.is(".a")) {
        return false;    // this stops the each function.
    } else {
        $e.hide('slow');
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If done right, Test Driven Development IS your design tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you forgive me for linking to &lt;a href="http://dotnet.kapenilattex.com/?p=36"&gt;my own blog entry, wherein I discuss the pitfalls of Test Driven Development that went wrong&lt;/a&gt; simply because developers treated their tests as, merely, tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a previous project, devs used a highly damaging singleton pattern that enforced dependencies throughout the project, which just broke the whole thing when requirements were changed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;TDD was treated as a task, when it
  should have been treated as an an
  approach. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;There was a failure to recognize
  that TDD is not about tests, its
  about design. The rampant case of
  singleton abuse in the unit tests made
  this obvious: instead of the test
  writers thinking WTF are these
  singleton = value; statements doing in
  my tests?, the test writers just
  propagated the singleton into the
  tests. 330 times.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The unfortunate consequence is that
  the build server-enforced testing was
  made to pass, whatever it took. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test Driven Development, done right, should make developers highly aware of design pitfalls like tight coupling, violations of DRY (don't repeat yourself), violations of SRP (Single Responsibility Principle), etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you write passing code for your tests for the sake of passing your tests, you have already failed: you should treat &lt;em&gt;hard to write&lt;/em&gt; tests as signposts that make you ask: why is this done this way? Why can't I test this code without depending on some other code? Why can't I reuse this code? Why is this code breaking when used by itself? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides if your design is &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; clean, and your code &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; maintainable why is it not trivial to write a test for it?&lt;/p&gt;

It's extremely common to see code that just doesn't know how to interact with a database in a way that leverages the capabilities of the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To turn that around and try and answer your question; what I think is missing from databases is an easy way to create an actual API between a database and the applications using it. SQL isn't really an API that's useful here, because it means intimately tying the application in with the structure of the database. An example of a useful API is creating stored procedures/functions for every action that the applications need to perform, but that currently requires a lot of extra work in the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I'd also like to see is more powerful procedural languages in the database that still make it very easy to interact with the database. Postgres allows you to use languages like Perl and Python inside the database, but the interaction between the language and the database is nowhere near as clean and easy as it is in plpgsql. On the other hand, plpgsql is not a very powerful language; it's only real benefit is how easy it is to interact with the database. Having something like a more powerful plpgsql would make it easier to create a database API, at least on the database side.&lt;/p&gt;

I find it a bit easier to read than the ones that came after it.  It also compares CRFs to HMMs and MEMMs (diagrams included.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

What is usually &lt;strong&gt;far&lt;/strong&gt; more useful than looking at a query &lt;em&gt;plan&lt;/em&gt; is looking at the actual &lt;em&gt;execution&lt;/em&gt;. In Postgres, this is the difference between EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN ANALYZE. EXPLAIN ANALYZE actually executes the query, and gets real timing information for every node. That lets you see what's &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; happening, instead of what the planner &lt;em&gt;thinks&lt;/em&gt; will happen. Many times you'll find that a sequential scan isn't an issue at all, instead it's something else in the query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other key is identifying what the actual expensive step is. Many graphical tools will use different sized arrows to indicate how much different parts of the plan cost. In that case, just look for steps that have thin arrows coming in and a thick arrow leaving. If you're not using a GUI you'll need to eyeball the numbers and look for where they suddenly get much larger. With a little practice it becomes fairly easy to pick out the problem areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;use-a-library&lt;/strong&gt; : I prefer always doing the use-a-library solution unless you have a darn good reason otherwise.  One possible site which wraps the "hard solution" as a service for you: &lt;a href="http://thumbnails.iwebtool.com/demo/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://thumbnails.iwebtool.com/demo/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;easy&lt;/strong&gt;: The easy solution is to just load the target webpage as a downscaled AJAXy window.  You can use many of the Lightbox-class plugins for this task, particularly the ones which allow you to target arbitrary HTTP content for the Lightbox window.  &lt;a href="http://www.orangoo.com/labs/GreyBox/" rel="nofollow"&gt;GreyBox&lt;/a&gt; is my favorite of those which I have used before.  &lt;a href="http://particletree.com/features/lightbox-gone-wild/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Lightbox Gone Wild&lt;/a&gt; is also nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hard&lt;/strong&gt;: Then there is the hard solution: you need to render the web page server side, cache the rendering as an image, and then serve up that image using Lightbox-esque Javascript (which is trivial next to the other requirements).  How you would go about doing this is outside the scope of this box.  Why would you do it this way?  The preview generates MUCH faster for the client, and it hermetically seals the client's session away from things which might bust it in the target website -- poorly behaving Javascript and/or malware can cause Really Bad Things when you open them, even in an AJAXy window-within-a-window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For very long strings you should not load the entire string into memory and instead either split the lines or use an iterative loop&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft tools are a good place to start, but it's possible to write better software faster by using other companion products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change is good, so always think about ways that code can be changed and verified quickly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it isn't tested, it's not production quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, after version control (!), I'd start with continuous integration, and show how getting immediate feedback on the quality of a build can help improve quality from the first moment. Doing CI first doesn't change the codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I'd introduce automated end-to-end testing of the application with FitNesse, Watin or somesuch. This should then illustrate how refactoring code isn't something to be afraid of if you have good testing tools that will verify that the code still works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I'd do gentle refactoring to break out business logic and domain objects from the UI (if they're not there already) and introduce unit testing. This further shows how refactoring is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we aim to get some sort of seperation of concerns, design patterns (such as IoC) will naturally start to become apparent. It's also going to be obvious that we can replace the data layer with ORM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we refactor, I'd also show how test-driven development can actually speed creation of better code. This is probably easiest shown for the first time with new development, as otherwise it's quite a culture shock!&lt;/p&gt;

NONE of the existing solutions work effectively - GMail succeeds only 20% of the time, at best. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's actually a lot worse than that, since that statistic is only using OCR, and there are other ways around it - for instance, CAPTCHA proxies and CAPTCHA farms. I recently gave a talk on the subject at OWASP, but the ppt is not online yet...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While CAPTCHA cannot provide actual protection in any form, it may be enough for your needs, if what you want is to block casual drive-by trash. But it won't stop even semi-professional spammers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, for a site with resources of any value to protect, you need a 3-pronged approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throttle responses from authenticated users only, disallow anonymous posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimize (not prevent) the few trash posts from authenticated users - e.g. reputation-based. A human moderator can also help here, but then you have other problems - namely, flooding (or even drowning) the moderator, and some sites prefer the openness...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use server-side heuristic logic to identify spam-like behavior, or better non-human-like behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CAPTCHA can help a TINY bit with the second prong, simply because it changes the economics - if the other prongs are in place, it no longer becomes worthwhile to bother breaking through the CAPTCHA (minimal cost, but still a cost) to succeed in such a small amount of spam. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, not all of your spam (and other trash) will be computer generated - using CAPTCHA proxy or farm the bad guys can have real people spamming you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CAPTCHA proxy is when they serve your image to users of other sites, e.g. porn, games, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A CAPTCHA farm has many cheap laborers (India, far east, etc) solving them... typically between 2-4$ per 1000 captchas solved. Recently saw a posting for this on Ebay...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Text="Title" set's the menu's displayed text from the Web.sitemap's Text field. I noticed that the MenuItemBinding item had a field called NavigateUrlField.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to solve this issue, you simple need to change/add to the asp:MenuItemBinding&lt;/p&gt;

Bear in mind this was before the whole open source thing and Microsoft was still pretty cagey about releasing documentation of internals - let alone source. 
There was some quote in there like "If you are working through some problem and hit some sticking point then you need to stop and really look deeply into that piece and really understand how it works". I've found this to be pretty good advice - particularly these days when you often have the source for a library and can go take a look. 
Its also inspired me to enjoy diving into the internals of how systems work, something that has proven invaluable over the course of my career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests get you #1.  Your code is not done just because the tests have passed.  Preferably you have some concept of project structure (Utilities, commonly accessed objects, layers, framework) before you start writing your tests/code.  After you've written your code to make the tests pass, you need to re-evaluate it to see which parts can be refactored out to the different aspects of your application.  Yuo can do this confidently, because you know that as long as your tests are still passing, you code is still functional (or at least meeting the requirements).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of a project, give thought to the structure.  As the project goes on continue to evaluate and re-evaluate your code to keep the design in place or change the design if it stops making sense.

&lt;p&gt;The software receives data immediately as it is generated from the source, then based on certain rules, raises an alert when certain conditions are met. It takes the approach of checking the last 30 seconds of data every 30 seconds to see whether the criteria for a rule has been met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The access patterns you will be using and how often each will be used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The relationships between your types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What indices you are going to need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The write patterns you will be using (in order to effectively spread load)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GAE's datastore automatically denormalizes your data. That is, each index contains a (mostly) complete copy of the data, and thus every index adds significantly to time taken to perform a write, and the storage space used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this were not the case, designing a Datastore schema would be a lot more work: You would have to think carefully about the primary key for each type, and consider the effect of your decision on the locality of data. For example, when rendering a blog post you would probably need to display the comments to go along with it, so each comment's key would probably begin with the associated post's key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Datastore, this is not such a big deal: The query you use will look something like "Select * FROM Comment WHERE post_id = N." (If you want to page the comments, you would also have a limit clause, and a possible suffix of " AND comment_id &gt; last_comment_id".) Once you add such a query, Datastore will build the index for you, and your reads will be magically fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something to keep in mind is that each additional index creates some additional cost: it is best if you can use as few access patterns as possible, since it will reduce the number of indices GAE will construct, and thus the total storage required by your data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading over this answer, I find it a little vague. Maybe a hands-on design question would help to scope this down? :-)&lt;/p&gt;

Though clearly something that takes 2 hours to respond to a request is not real time, a 30 second delay might be fast enough to qualify as real time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work on what I consider real time systems, where when an event happens in the sytem it is immediately propogated to devices on the system, such that the delay in knowing about an update on a device is product of the network latency and the time take to update its in-memory data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally wouldn't classify something with that polls for updates every 30 seconds as realtime.  We have a web app as part of the afore mentioned system that does just that, it refreshes every 30 seconds, so the user is presented with data that is at most 30 seconds old.  Contrast this with the win forms equalivent that is updated as soon as the event occurs.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, "real time" is bounded by your definition of a timely response.&lt;/p&gt;

Also, a malicious user could simply enter text without any spaces, or using some Unicode look-alike to the standard space character, in which case any solution you use may end up displaying the entire text anyway. A way around this may be to check the string length after splitting it on spaces as normal, then, if the string is still above an abnormal limit - maybe 225 characters in this case - going ahead and splitting it dumbly at that limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more caveat with things like this when it comes to non-ASCII characters; strings containing them may be interpreted by PHP's standard strlen() as being longer than they really are, because a single character may take two or more bytes instead of just one. If you just use the strlen()/substr() functions to split strings, you may split a string in the middle of a character!

&lt;p&gt;You certainly wouldn't want to end up with exception driven flow, but avoiding exceptions altogether is also a bad idea. You have to find a balance between both approaches. What I would not do is to create an exception type for every exceptional situation. That is not productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I generally prefer is to create two basic types of exceptions which are used throughout the system: &lt;em&gt;LogicalException&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;TechnicalException&lt;/em&gt;. These can be further distinguished by subtypes if needed, but it is not generally not necessary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical exception denotes the really unexpected exception like database server being down, the connection to the web service threw the IOException and so on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand the logical exceptions are used to propagate the less severe erroneous situation to the upper layers (generally some validation result). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that even the logical exception is not intended to be used on regular basis to control the program flow, but rather to highlight the situation when the flow should really end. When used in Java, both exception types are &lt;em&gt;RuntimeException&lt;/em&gt; subclasses and error handling is highly aspect oriented. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the login example it might be wise to create something like AuthenticationException and distinguish the concrete situations by enum values like &lt;em&gt;UsernameNotExisting&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PasswordMismatch&lt;/em&gt; etc. Then you won't end up in having a huge exception hierarchy and can keep the catch blocks on maintainable level. You can also easily employ some generic exception handling mechanism since you have the exceptions categorized and know pretty well what to propagate up to the user and how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our typical usage is to throw the LogicalException during the Web Service call when the user's input was invalid. The Exception gets marshalled to the SOAPFault detail and then gets unmarshalled to the exception again on the client which is resulting in showing the validation error on one certain web page input field since the exception has proper mapping to that field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is certainly not the only situation: you don't need to hit web service to throw up the exception. You are free to do so in any exceptional situation (like in the case you need to fail-fast) - it is all at your discretion.&lt;/p&gt;

If you want OOP in Javascript that closely mirrors more traditional/classical inheritance patterns, pick a framework, learn its quirks, and don't try to get clever.  If you want to get clever, learn javascript as a functional language, and avoid thinking about things like classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings up one of the most important things to keep in mind about Javascript, and to repeat to yourself when it doesn't make sense.  Javascript does not have classes. If something looks like a class, it's a clever trick. Javascript has &lt;strong&gt;objects&lt;/strong&gt; (no derisive quotes needed) and &lt;strong&gt;functions&lt;/strong&gt;.  (that's not 100% accurate, functions are just objects, but it can sometimes be helpful to think of them as separate things)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; variable is attached to functions.  Whenever you invoke a function, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is given a certain value, depending on how you invoke the function.  This is often called the invocation pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four ways to invoke functions in javascript.  You can invoke the function as a &lt;em&gt;method&lt;/em&gt;, as a &lt;em&gt;function&lt;/em&gt;, as a &lt;em&gt;constructor&lt;/em&gt;, and with &lt;em&gt;apply&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;As a Method&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A method is a function that's attached to an object&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var foo = {};
foo.someMethod = function(){
    alert(this);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When invoked as a method, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; will be bound to the object the function/method is a part of.  In this example, this will be bound to foo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;As A Function&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a stand alone function, the &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; variable will be bound to the "global" object, almost always the &lt;em&gt;window&lt;/em&gt; object in the context of a browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; var foo = function(){
    alert(this);
 }
 foo();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This may be what's tripping you up&lt;/strong&gt;, but don't feel bad.  Many people consider this a bad design decision.  Since a callback is invoked as a function and not as a method,  that's why you're seeing what appears to be inconsistent behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people get around the problem by doing something like, um, this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var foo = {};
foo.someMethod = function (){
    var that=this;
    function bar(){
        alert(that);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You define a variable &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; which points to &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;. Closure (a topic all it's own) keeps &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; around, so if you call bar as a callback, it still has a reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;As a Constructor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also invoke a function as a constructor.  Based on the naming convention you're using (&lt;code&gt;TestObject&lt;/code&gt;) this also &lt;strong&gt;may be what you're doing and is what's tripping you up&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You invoke a function as a Constructor with the &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; keyword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function Foo(){
    this.confusing = 'hell yeah';
}
var myObject = new Foo();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When invoked as a constructor, a new Object will be created, and &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; will be bound to that object.  Again, if you have inner functions and they're used as callbacks, you'll be invoking them as functions, and &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; will be bound to the global object.  Use that &lt;code&gt;var that = this;&lt;/code&gt; trick/pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people think the constructor/new keyword was a bone thrown to Java/traditional OOP programmers as a way to create something similar to classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;With the Apply Method.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, every function has a method (yes, functions are objects in Javascript) named &lt;code&gt;apply&lt;/code&gt;.  Apply lets you determine what the value of &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; will be, and also lets you pass in an array of arguments.  Here's a useless example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function foo(a,b){
    alert(a);
    alert(b);
    alert(this);
}
var args = ['ah','be'];
foo.apply('omg',args);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you want to build from cvs, you're on your own. However, you can more easily build from source if you use an official release.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;If you download ikvm-0.36.0.11.zip, classpath-0.95-stripped.zip and openjdk-b13-stripped.zip from SourceForge (the last two are under the ikvm 0.36.0.5 release) you have all the sources that are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Now you'll have to open a Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt (i.e. one that has cl.exe and peverify in the path).&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Then in the ikvm root directory, do a "nant clean" followed by "nant". That should build the whole project. After you done that, you should be able to build in Visual Studio (debug target only), but you may need to repair the assembly references in the projects (unless you have ikvm installed in c:\ikvm).&lt;/p&gt;

The abilty to test and verify components / sub-components independently has made it easier for me to make rapid changes and try out new design ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference I've experienced with TDD is reliability.  The process of working out component interfacing on smaller levels of component at the begining of the design process, rather than later, is that I've got components I can trust will work &lt;em&gt;earlier&lt;/em&gt;, so I can stop worrying about the little pieces and instead get to work on the tough problems.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote the &lt;a href="http://www.codeplex.com/TFSCCNetPlugin/"&gt;CruiseControl.NET integration for TFS&lt;/a&gt;.  It works fine and gives you the same build capabilities that you are used to. To me, CC.NET's main advantage is that it is completely extensible and has integrations with all the major SCM and build systems under the sun. The main reason I wrote the CC.NET integration to TFS it is that in TFS2005 the build system did not have out-the-box CI support.  However the TFS2008 version is much improved and the team continue to very actively improve it for future releases of TFS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason for switching to TFS Build would be so that it automatically reports the build information back into TFS which helps complete the software development picture in terms of reporting.  It also integrates nicely with the work item tracking side of TFS and inside the IDE (both in Visual Studio and Eclipse).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, if you have large investments in Nant scripts that do more than just compile and test your code or you already have a home-brewed reporting solution you might want to stick with what you have.&lt;/p&gt;

I have been able to work with, and around these issues, &lt;strong&gt;but am left with one wherein I could use some expert suggestions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a particular bug that is induced by the "lift" of the stylus off of the active surface. Basically the mouse cursor disappears and then reappears when you "press" it back onto the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes sense that this is unaccounted for in the application. you can't &lt;strong&gt;lift&lt;/strong&gt; the cursor on a desktop pc. So what I am looking for is a good overview on what happens (in terms of windows messages, etc.) when the lift occurs. Does this translate to just focus changes and mouseover events? My bug seems to also involve cursor changes (may not be lift related though). Certainly the unexpected "lift" is breaking the state of the application's tool processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So the tangible questions are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens when a stylus "lift" occurs? A press?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What API calls can be used to detect this? Does it just translate into standard messages with flags/values set?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whats a good way to test/emulate this when your development pc is a desktop? Am I just flying blind here? (I only have periodic access to a tablet pc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What represents correct behavior or best practice for tablet stylus awareness?&lt;/li&gt;

In short, it's a way to use a value that is not yet known. The value can then be calculated on demand (lazy evaluation) and, optionally, concurrently with the main calculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C++ example follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you want to calculate the sum of two numbers. You can either have the typical eager implementation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int add(int i, int j) { return i + j; }
// first calculate both Nth_prime results then pass them to add
int sum = add(Nth_prime(4), Nth_prime(2)); 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or you can use the futures way using C++11's &lt;code&gt;std::async&lt;/code&gt;, which returns an &lt;code&gt;std::future&lt;/code&gt;. In this case, the &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; function will only block if it tries to use a value that hasn't yet been computed (one can also create a purely lazy alternative).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int add(future&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; i, future&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; j) { return i.get() + j.get(); }

&lt;p&gt;Dear AWS Customer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of you have asked us to let you know ahead of time about features and services that are currently under development so that you can better plan for how that functionality might integrate with your applications. To that end, we are excited to share some early details with you about a new offering we have under development here at AWS -- a content delivery service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new service will provide you a high performance method of distributing content to end users, giving your customers low latency and high data transfer rates when they access your objects. The initial release will help developers and businesses who need to deliver popular, publicly readable content over HTTP connections. Our goal is to create a content delivery service that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets developers and businesses get started easily - there are no minimum fees and no commitments. You will only pay for what you actually use. 
Is simple and easy to use - a single, simple API call is all that is needed to get started delivering your content. 
Works seamlessly with Amazon S3 - this gives you durable storage for the original, definitive versions of your files while making the content delivery service easier to use. 
Has a global presence - we use a global network of edge locations on three continents to deliver your content from the most appropriate location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll start by storing the original version of your objects in Amazon S3, making sure they are publicly readable. Then, you'll make a simple API call to register your bucket with the new content delivery service. This API call will return a new domain name for you to include in your web pages or application. When clients request an object using this domain name, they will be automatically routed to the nearest edge location for high performance delivery of your content. It's that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're currently working with a small group of private beta customers, and expect to have this service widely available before the end of the year. If you'd like to be notified when we launch, please let us know by clicking here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Amazon Web Services Team &lt;/p&gt;

Also the Eclipse RCP platform contains UpdateManager that does what WebStart do, but also much more.&lt;/p&gt;

The most important part of that to me is the way that it builds in the ability to make more changes (you know, when you have that flash of insight moment where you can add functionality by deleting code) with greatly reduced risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, some of the more algorithmic work I've contracted on lately has suffered a bit under TDD without a careful balance of design thought.  The statement above about safer refactoring was still a great benefit, but for some algorithms TDD is (although still useful) not sufficient to get you to an ideal solution.  Take sorting as a simple example.  TDD could easily lead you to a suboptimal (N^2) algorithm (and scads of passing tests that allow you to refactor to a quick sort) like a bubble sort.  TDD is a tool, a very good tool, but like many things needs to be used appropriately for the context of the problem being solved.&lt;/p&gt;

We are working with 15 developers on a project of several thousand classes and even more XML and .properties files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree there are problems with ANT integration, so for production and nightly builds I recommend an external build system based on ANT scripts started from a shell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However while working in Eclipse make sure you have the automatic build feature on (it should be by default, but checking does not hurt). This should free you from any concerns regarding what to build and when. Sometimes (very rarely for me) there are problems when I have to switch of the automatic build, clean all projects and trigger a manual build via the menu. From time to time I have to trigger the build multiple times (not the cleaning!), but once everything has been built again, turning the auto-build on works great again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for long running instances: My machine keeps logged in basically all the time (day and night) and there are at least two Eclipse instances running at all times. I have not seen any problems with these sessions, even when they remain open for literally weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the problems I have seen in the 5 years I have been using Eclipse originated from people installing too many plugins - the only stuff I have added is Checkstyle, the "implementors plugin" and some proprietary stuff for the application framework we are using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you can try using a rather clean Eclipse installation the "usual way" for a while (i. e. with the sources imported to the workspace folder).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding NetBeans: I use it from time to time as well, but I think it is a matter of taste and I like Eclipse better. This may be different for you.&lt;/p&gt;

When I call the 'Execute' method on the service from a console application
all actions preformed run under the context of the 'Network Service' account.
The Network Service account has not enough rights to create an organization
so many problems occur during the action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Registry access not allowed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not the correct SQL Server rights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not enough AD rights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impersonation doesn't work, the service uses the process account to perform
the actions.  The only thing that works is to run the CRMAppPool identity as
an administrator which has the deployment administrator rights (added through
the Deployment manager tool).
 But this issues in CRM deployment doesnt seem to faceoff from me :(. now that i have a new issue after changing the Pool identity to the system administrator, the deployment service gives an error saying Unauthorized!!!! and further when i check the log it says..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When data is being abstracted, I've thought that renaming the file to something unique or append a unique string to filename to keep it from overwriting other existing files. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the file is going to be archived, I've thought of three strategies. One is to keep all files uploaded from a certain data in one folder. (2006/sept/04, 2008/jan/05) The other is to keep a folder and keep filling it until some max number of files I want to keep in folder and then create another one (/folder001/, /folder002/, /folder003/, etc..). Another one is to create subfolders once they reach some threshold. So like (/j/jd/jde/jdelator) I've seen this in unix not sure how to explain this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You cannot very easily keep a "keyboard focus" on a window when the stylus has to trail out of the focused window to push a key on the virtual keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the virtual keyboards I've used (The windows tablet input panel and one under ubuntu) allow the program they are typing in to keep "keyboard focus."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What happens when a stylus "lift" occurs? A press?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Windows, the pressure value drops, but outside of that, there is no event. (I don't know about linux.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What API calls can be used to detect this? Does it just translate into standard messages with flags/values set?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, if you can get the pressure value, you can use that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whats a good way to test/emulate this when your development pc is a desktop? Am I just flying blind here? (I only have periodic access to a tablet pc)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the stylus is placed down elsewhere, the global coordinates of the pointer change, so, you can emulate the sudden pointer move with anything that allows you to change the global pointer values.  (The Robot class in Java makes this fairly easy.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What represents correct behavior or best practice for tablet stylus awareness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd recommend you read what Microsoft has to say, the MSDN website has a number of excellent articles. (&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms704849(VS.85).aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms704849(VS.85).aspx&lt;/a&gt;)
I'll point out that the size of the buttons on your applications makes a HUGE difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this was of help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have three developers in our small team and we have initiated a roster system, afternoons only, where the sales and support staff know which developer has made themselves available for interruptions.

&lt;p&gt;It works well because I find when devs are prepared for the "annoying tech support interruptions" ahead of time, they cope with them more pleasantly. Also, most "emergencies" can "wait until  lunch time when a developer will be available to help".&lt;/p&gt;

It does have it's own C++ class libs (as Hernan points out), but nothing stops you from using any other class libs like the SDL, or you can roll your own.

It uses the standard compiler &amp;amp; debugger (gcc, g++, gdb) on Linux and the MS compiler/debugger on that platform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only (very small) gripe I have is the home-made names for projects (called Nest's &amp;amp; so forth).

It's not only hyperlinks that is the problem. &lt;em&gt;Any&lt;/em&gt; control, like Button, ListBox, ComboBox - anything that the user can interact with - is "grayed out" regardless of the IsEnabled properties if the FlowDocument is inside a FlowDocumentScrollViewer. &lt;/p&gt;

Alright, it must have been a mistake or something from my end, because I ended up rewriting the control and now it works. I guess there was some sort if IsEnabled=False somewhere in the visual tree that caused this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just use a jar. This assumes that the user has the the correct java version installed, otherwise the user will get "class-file format version" exceptions. This is fine for internal distribution inside a company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use launch4j and an installer like NSIS. This gives you a lot more control, although the user can still do stupid stuff like un-installing the java runtime. This is probably the most popular approach, and what I currently use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use Webstart. This also assumes that the user has the correct java version installed, but it's a lot easier to get going. My experience is that this is fine for tightly controlled intranet environments, but becomes a pain with larger deployments because it has some many weird failures. It may get better with the new plug-in technology in Java 1.7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use a native-code compiler like Excelsior JET and distribute as a executable, or wrap it up in an installer. Expensive, and it generally ties you to a slightly older version of java, and there is some pain with dynamic class-loading, but its very effective for large-scale deployment where you need to minimise your support hassles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

The colleagues in question have been tasked with providing some reports from an internal application with a large Oracle database backend, and they simply don't have the skills to do this. While some might question whether I have those skills either (grin), apparently enough people think I do to mean I can't weasel out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to my question - in order to extract the reports from the database, my script is obviously having to connect and run queries. I haven't thus far managed to come up with a good solution for where to store the username and password for the database so it is currently being stored as plaintext in the script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a good solution for this that someone else has already written, perhaps as a CPAN module? Or is there something else that's better to do - like keep the user / password combo in a completely separate file that's hidden away somewhere else on the filesystem? Or should I be keeping them trivially encrypted to just avoid them being pulled out of my scripts with a system-wide grep?&lt;/p&gt;

The Oracle database sits on an HP-UX server.&lt;br&gt;
The Application server (running the shell scripts) is Solaris.&lt;br&gt;
Setting the scripts to be owned by just me is a no-go, they have to be owned by a service account that multiple support personnel have access to.&lt;br&gt; 
The scripts are intended to be run as cron jobs.&lt;br&gt;
I'd love to go with public-key authentication, but am unaware of methods to make that work with Oracle - if there is such a method - please enlighten me!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fast, very portable code&lt;/strong&gt; using deferred binding; only loads the code that works on the user's browser, and only loads functions that are actually called; also, they're compressed&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;easier debugging&lt;/strong&gt; using a Java-based IDE; you can also look directly at un-obfuscated javascript if you want to, but it seems (based on some reports I've seen &amp;amp; personal experience) that you basically never need this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;good library support&lt;/strong&gt; including a nice inline javascript interface, the ability to use existing Java libraries, and special support for ajax / rpc calls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;extensible &amp;amp; stylistically flexible&lt;/strong&gt;; you can fine-tune all styles with your own css rules, and extend the Widget base with your own Java subclasses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I humbly disagree with dominic that the results are ugly since it is up to the coder to 'prettify' the basic functionality with their own css rules and other decorations.  It would be the same mistake to call HTML 'ugly' - if you don't try hard, it isn't pretty, but the power and flexibility is in the hands of the coder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This led me to think about the best way to group 'helper' functions together.  The Java/C# way would be to use a class of static functions with a private constructor, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Helper  
{  
private:  
  Helper() { }
public:  
  static int HelperFunc1();  
  static int HelperFunc2();  
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, being C++ you could also use a namespace:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;namespace Helper  
{  
  int HelperFunc1();  
  int HelperFunc2();  
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most cases I think I would prefer the namespace approach but I wanted to know what the pros and cons of each approach are.  If used the class approach for example, would there be any overheads?&lt;/p&gt;

Graphical programming will always be an option but simply does not provide the functionality in an elegant manner that would make it more efficient to use than textual programming for low-level programming.  This is not a bad thing - the whole point of abstraction is to allow a new understanding and view of a problem domain.  The reason I believe many may be disappointed with graphical programming though is that, for any particular program, the incremental gain in going from programming in C to graphical is not nearly the same as going from assembly to C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge of graphical programming would benefit any future programmer for sure.  There will probably be opportunities in the future that only require knowledge of graphical programming and perhaps some of your students could benefit from some early experience with it.

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The search functionality is improving.
  However, is it still limited (for
  example, no OR search). It also has
  limited filtering options. One major
  problem for me is that it displays
  searches the answers as well as
  questions. So, you can end up with a
  page of results that point to one
  question (which may not help you). Tag
  searching is also improving but still
  limited and even misunderstood by its
  creator (see the comments).&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding Your Stack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I am a C# developer. I work on Windows
  and ASP.NET applications. I know
  nothing about Java, Python, Ruby and
  the many other languages out there. I
  can offer limited advice on
  architecture and design. Now,
  currently, it is bloody difficult for
  me to find questions with the
  appropriate tags so I can assist. I
  propose:&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"Smart Lists" - these should be lists that each user can create that
  you can specify tags to search for.
  For example, I could create three
  "Windows" (which searches for items
  tagged "C# WinForms"), "Web" (tagged
  "ASP.NET") and Architecture (tagged
  "architecture"). Now, a web developer
  who works on the LAMP stack may have a
  "Web" tab, but entirely different
  tags.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I am currently getting around this by
  having Launchy shortcuts set up for my
  stacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;There can be &lt;strong&gt;null&lt;/strong&gt; Integer objects in the array and you have no bits left for indicating this in an int array. The VM could store this 1-bit information per array slot in a hiden bit-array though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can synchronize in the elements of an Integer array. This is much harder to overcome as the first point, since you would have to store a monitor object for each array slot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The elements of Integer[] can be compared for identity. You could for example create two Integer objects with the value 1 via &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt; and store them in different array slots and later you retrieve them and compare them via ==. This must lead to false, so you would have to store this information somewhere. Or you keep a reference to one of the Integer objects somewhere and use this for comparison and you have to make sure one of the == comparisons is false and one true. This means the whole concept of object identity is quiet hard to handle for the &lt;em&gt;optimized&lt;/em&gt; Integer array.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can cast an Integer[] to e.g. Object[] and pass it to methods expecting just an Object[]. This means all the code which handles Object[] must now be able to handle the special Integer[] object too, making it slower and larger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking all this into account, it would probably be possible to make a special Integer[] which saves some space in comparison to a &lt;em&gt;naive&lt;/em&gt; implementation, but the additional complexity will likely affect a lot of other code, making it slower in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overhead of using Integer[] instead of int[] can be quiet large in space and time. On a typical 32 bit VM an Integer object will consume 16 byte (8 byte for the object header, 4 for the payload and 4 additional bytes for alignment) while the Integer[] uses as much space as int[]. In 64 bit VMs (using 64bit pointers, which is not always the case) an Integer object will consume 24 byte (16 for the header, 4 for the payload and 4 for alignment). In addition a slot in the Integer[] will use 8 byte instead of 4 as in the int[]. This means you can expect an overhead of &lt;strong&gt;16 to 28&lt;/strong&gt; byte per slot, which is a &lt;strong&gt;factor of 4 to 7&lt;/strong&gt; compared to plain int arrays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performance overhead can be significant too for mainly two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since you use more memory, you put on much more pressure on the memory subsystem, making it more likely to have cache misses in the case of Integer[]. For example if you traverse the contents of the int[] in a linear manner, the cache will have most of the entries already fetched when you need them (since the layout is linear too). But in case of the Integer array, the Integer objects itself might be scattered randomly in the heap, making it hard for the cache to guess where the next memory reference will point to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The garbage collection has to do much more work because of the additional memory used and because it has to scan and move each Integer object separately, while in the case of int[] it is just one object and the contents of the object doesn't have to be scanned (they contain no reference to other objects).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum it up, using an int[] in performance critical work will be both much faster and memory efficient than using an Integer array in current VMs and it is unlikely this will change much in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

The concept is generally used in concurrent systems, for scheduling computations over values that may or may not have been computed yet, and further, whose computation may or may not already be in progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A future is associated with a
  specific thread that computes its
  value. This computation may be started
  either eagerly when the future is
  created, or lazily when its value is
  first needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not mentioned in the article, futures are a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monads_in_functional_programming" rel="nofollow"&gt;Monad&lt;/a&gt;, and so it is possible to project functions on future values into the monad to have them applied to the future value when it becomes available, yielding another future which in turn represents the result of that function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Set errno to zero before calling the functions; no function does that for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Open Group page linked to (which I went to before noticing that Patrick had linked to it too) points out that errno may not be set.  It is set to ERANGE if the value is out of range; it &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be set (but equally, &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be set) to EINVAL if the argument is invalid.&lt;/li&gt;

There is probably a way to play a specific sound, but I didn't dig that hard.  Here are the basic steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add A New Macro Module&lt;/strong&gt; (steps below the code)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Imports System.Runtime.InteropServices
Public Module Beeps
    Public Sub WindowsBeep()
        Interaction.Beep()
    End Sub
    Public Sub ForceBeep()
        Beep(900, 300)
    End Sub
    &amp;lt;DllImport("Kernel32.dll")&amp;gt; _
    Private Function Beep(ByVal frequency As UInt32, ByVal duration As UInt32) As Boolean
    End Function
End Module
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tools =&gt; Macros =&gt; Macros IDE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My Macros (In Project Explorer) =&gt; Add New Module =&gt; Name: "Beeps"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the above code in.  It has 2 methods
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First one uses the windows "Beep" sound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second one forces a "Beep" tone, not a .wav file.  This works with all sounds disabled (eg Control Panel -&gt; Sounds -&gt; Sound Scheme: No Sounds), but sounds ugly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View the Macro Explorer in VS.Net (not the macro IDE) to make sure it is there :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assign To A Breakpoint&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a break point to a line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right click on the little red dot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select "When Hit"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the box to enable macros&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select your macro from the pulldown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncheck&lt;/strong&gt; "continue execution" if you want to stop.  It is checked by default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; ways to play an arbitrary wav file, but that seems excessive for an alert.  Perhaps the forced "beep" is the best, since that at least &lt;em&gt;sounds&lt;/em&gt; different than Ding.&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href="http://www.memorymanagement.org/glossary/full.html#brk"&gt;Memory Management Glossary&lt;/a&gt; web page has a diagram of this memory layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stack and heap are traditionally located at opposite ends of the process's virtual address space. The stack grows automatically when accessed, up to a size set by the kernel (which can be adjusted with &lt;code&gt;setrlimit(RLIMIT_STACK, ...)&lt;/code&gt;). The heap grows when the memory allocator invokes the &lt;code&gt;brk()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;sbrk()&lt;/code&gt; system call, mapping more pages of physical memory into the process's virtual address space. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In systems without virtual memory, such as some embedded systems, the same basic layout often applies, except the stack and heap are fixed in size. However, in other embedded systems (such as those based on Microchip PIC microcontrollers), the program stack is a separate block of memory that is not addressable by data movement instructions, and can only be modified or read indirectly through program flow instructions (call, return, etc.). Other architectures, such as Intel Itanium processors, have &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/04/21/410397.aspx"&gt;multiple stacks&lt;/a&gt;. In this sense, the stack is an element of the CPU architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

- update some key in the registry (this is actually very common)
- the driver provides an alternate "channel" that the user mode app opens and writes specific commands to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may want to try using the process monitor from sysinternals to log registry activity when setting/resetting the feature.
As for the options 2 you may want to try IRP tracker from OSR and see if there's any specific communication between the panel and the driver (in the form or IRPs going back and forth). In this case, kernel programming knowledge is somewhat required.
The windows kernel debugger may also be useful to see if the PS/2 driver has some alternate channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was using the Process API to close the second virtual machine, but it wouldn't work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is that my second application is an Eclipse RCP Application, and I launched it using the eclipse.exe launcher included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that means that the Process API destroy() method will target the eclipse.exe process.  Killing this process leaves the Java Process unscathed.  So, one of my colleagues here wrote a small application that will kill the right application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So one of the solutions to use the Process API (and remove redundant middle steps) is to get away with the Eclipse launcher, having my first virtual machine duplicate all its functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that's the case you either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) update the webservice to handle UTF-8 encoding&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) if that's not possible, proxy your call to your own webservice that accepts UTF-8 and then call the actual one.&lt;/p&gt;

And then do an if() or switch() inside, and perform the appropriate actions. Because hey, the &lt;em&gt;functionality&lt;/em&gt; of the functions is different, so you have to do those different actions &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this adds runtime complexity (check things at runtime) in a place that could be just better checked at compile time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't understand what's the problem in adding extra parameters in the future in both (or more functions). It goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add more parameters to all functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compile your code, it won't compile in a bunch of places because it does not pass new parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fix all places that call those functions by passing new parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;profit! :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it's C++, of course you could make the function be a template, and instead adding an extra parameter, you add a template parameter, and then specialize template implementations to do different things. But this is just obfuscating the point, in my opinion. Code becomes harder to understand, and the process of extending it with more parameters is still &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the same:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add extra parameters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compile code, it won't compile in a bunch of places&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fix all places that call that function&lt;/li&gt;

So the answer is that it depends. I prefer starting with a user story/acceptance test which is the base of the requirement that my tests will aid in producing. Only after I've established that, I start writing detailed unit tests TDD-style. If the only design and thinking you do is through TDD, then you risk too much of a bottom up approach, which might give you units and classes that are excellent in isolation, but when you try to integrate them into the user story fulfilling task you might be surprised by having done it all wrong. For more inspiration on this, look att &lt;a href="http://blog.daveastels.com/files/BDD_Intro.pdf"&gt;BDD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.infoq.com/interviews/coplien-martin-tdd"&gt;A great "debate" about this has been recorded&lt;/a&gt; between Robert C. Martin and James Coplien, where the former is a TDD advocate and the latter has stated that it ruins the design of a system. This is what Robert said about TDD and design:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"There has been a feeling in the Agile
  community since about '99 that
  architecture is irrelevant, we don't
  need to do architecture, all we need
  to do is write a lots of tests and do
  lots of stories and do quick
  iterations and the code will assemble
  itself magically, and this has always
  been horse shit. I even think most of
  the original Agile proponents would
  agree that was a silliness."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Coplien states that merely driving your design from TDD has a great risk:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"One of the things we see a lot, in a
  lot of projects, is that projects go
  south on about their 3rd sprint and
  they crash and burn because they
  cannot go any further, because they
  have cornered themselves
  architecturally. And you can't
  refactor your way out of this because
  the refactoring has to be across class
  categories, across class hierarchies,
  and you no longer can have any
  assurances about having the same
  functionality."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also he gives a great example of how a bank account probably would look if you test drove it as compared to using your upfront knowledge to drive the architecture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"I remember when I was talking with
  Kent once, about in the early days
  when he was proposing TDD, and this
  was in the sense of YAGNI and doing
  the simplest thing that could possibly
  work, and he says: 'Ok. Let's make a
  bank account, a savings account.'
  What's a savings account? It's a
  number and you can add to the number
  and you can subtract from the number.
  So what a saving account is, is a
  calculator. Let's make a calculator,
  and we can show that you can add to
  the balance and subtract from the
  balance. That's the simplest thing
  that could possibly work, everything
  else is an evolution of that.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;If you do a real banking system, a
  savings account is not even an object
  and you are not going to refactor your
  way to the right architecture from
  that one. What a savings account is,
  is a process that does an iteration
  over an audit trail of database
  transactions, of deposits and interest
  gatherings and other shifts of the
  money. It's not like the savings
  account is some money sitting on the
  shelf on a bank somewhere, even though
  that is the user perspective, and
  you've just got to know that there are
  these relatively intricate structures
  in the foundations of a banking system
  to support the tax people and the
  actuaries and all these other folks,
  that you can't get to in an
  incremental way. Well, you can,
  because of course the banking industry
  has come to this after 40 years. You
  want to give yourself 40 years? It's
  not agile."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing here is that both the TDD proponent and the TDD antagonist are saying that you need design up front. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have the time, watch the video. It's a great discussion between two highly influential experts, and it's only 22 minutes long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;//Header a.h
// Lots of big header files, spreading throughout your code
class foo
{
  struct bar {/* ... */);
};

//header b.h
#include a.h // Required, no way around it, pulls in big headers
class b
{
  //...
  DoSomething(foo::bar);
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with namespaces...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;//Header a.h
// Big header files
namespace foo
{
  struct bar {/* ... */);
}

//header b.h
// Avoid include, instead forward declare 
//  (can put forward declares in a _fwd.h file)
namespace foo
{
  struct bar;
}

class b
{
  //...
  // note that foo:bar must be passed by reference or pointer
  void DoSomething(const foo::bar &amp;amp; o);
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forward declares make a big difference to your compile times after small header changes once you end up with a project spanning hundreds of source files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Edit from paercebal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer was too good to let it die because of an enum error (see comments). I replaced enums (which can be forward-declared only in C++0x, not in today C++) by structs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding what to lock, if you are working in a single file then lock that file. If you need to lock several files at once then - in order to avoid dead locks - it is better to pick one file that you are locking. Does not really matter if that is one of the several files you really need to lock or a separate file you create just for the locking purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

Once you have a sample of your target code (that right now does nothing) see if you can place a test scaffolding onto it. 
If you can't do that, figure out why you can't. 
Most of the time it's because you made a poor design decision (99%), however if that's not the case (1%) try the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;determine what the crazy requirements are that you need to abide to that wont let you test your code. One you understand the issues redesign your API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if someone else decided this requirements discuss about it him/her. They probably had a good reason for the requirement and once you know their reason you'll be able to perfect your design and make it testable. If not now you can both rework the requirement and you'll both be the better for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you have your target code and the test scaffolding. Implement the code. Now you even have the advantage of knowing how well your progressing as you pass your own test (Its a great motivator!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only case where testing may be superfluous, from personal experience, is when you are making an early prototype because at that point you still don't understand the problem well enough to design or test your code accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

Simply put, if you have huge objects that are expensive to create but seldom used, you can use a phantom cache to reference them and be sure they do not take up memory that is more valuable.  If you use regular references you have to be manually make sure there are no references left to the object.  You can argue the same about any object but you dont have to manually manage the references in your phantom cache.  Just have to be carefull to check if they have been collected or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also you can use a framework (i.e. a factory) where references are given as phantom references.  This is useful if the objects are many and short lived (i.e. used and then disposed).  Very handy for clearing memory if you have sloppy programmers that think garbage collection is magical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The databases I need to connect to are not known at design time (i.e.: I can't put their details in database.yaml).

&lt;li&gt;$var2 = 24 is an integer vhose value is 24.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you use these variables (in PHP), sometimes you don't have the good type.
For example, if you do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if ($var == 1) {... do something ...}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PHP have to convert ("to cast") $var to integer. In this case, "$var == 1" is true because any non-empty string is casted to 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using ===, you check that the value AND THE TYPE are equal, so "$var === 1" is false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is useful, for example, when you have a function that can return false (on error) and 0 (result) :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if(myFunction() == false) { ... error on myFunction ... }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This code is wrong as if &lt;code&gt;myFunction()&lt;/code&gt; returns 0, it is casted to false and you seem to have an error. The correct code is :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if(myFunction() === false) { ... error on myFunction ... }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For simple unidirectional communication, popen() is a decent solution.  It is no use for bi-directional communication, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMO, imjorge (Jorge Ferreira) gave most of the answer (80%?) for bi-directional communication - but omitted a few key details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is crucial that the parent process close the read end of the pipe that is used to send messages to the child process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is crucial that the child process close the write end of the pipe that is used to send messages to the child process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is crucial that the parent process close the write end of the pipe that is used to send messages to the parent process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is crucial that the child process close the read end of the pipe that is used to send messages to the parent process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not close the unused ends of the pipes, you do not get sensible behaviour when one of the programs terminates; for example, the child might be reading from its standard input, but unless the write end of the pipe is closed in the child, it will never get EOF (zero bytes from read) because it still has the pipe open and the system thinks it might sometime get around to writing to that pipe, even though it is currently hung waiting for something to read from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writing processes should consider whether to handle the SIGPIPE signal that is given when you write on a pipe where there is no reading process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to be aware of pipe capacity (platform dependent, and might be as little as 4KB) and design the programs to avoid deadlock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment the database schema is such that persons table has postal address columns, phone number columns as does organizations table. This is not a good way to handle this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've read the c2 Wiki on this and there's some good discussion regarding &lt;a href="http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?ContactAndAddressModels" rel="nofollow"&gt;Contact and address models (&lt;a href="http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?ContactAndAddressModels" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?ContactAndAddressModels&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; and wheter or not &lt;a href="http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?ArePhysicalPostalAddressesArchaic" rel="nofollow"&gt;physical addresses are archaic (&lt;a href="http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?ArePhysicalPostalAddressesArchaic" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?ArePhysicalPostalAddressesArchaic&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;. These two discussions really opened my eyes on the scope of this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking about separating &lt;b&gt;contact information fields to separate table(s)&lt;/b&gt;. But what's the best way to do this. At the moment the application mainly handles Finnish addresses but it's on the horizon that it needs also to handle international addresses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could define an "addresses" -table, a "phone numbers" -table, an "email addresses" -table and so on and these would be linked to people and organizations. But this just feels too much like the previous solution: it's inevitable that the predefined database schema isn't sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I'm proposing is to create a contact information schema/program logic that is &lt;b&gt;dynamic&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;There are no predefined contact information fields/field sets&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Users can define new contact information types and required fields at any time like
  &lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Finnish postal address&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Swedish postal address&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;... postal address&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Phone number&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Email address&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;ICQ-number&lt;/li&gt;
  
 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is this feasible?&lt;/b&gt; Has anyone done anything like this? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There could be a table that defines contact information types:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;contact information types&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Id: Identifier&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Name: "Finnish postal address"&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Description: "Use this contact information type for finnish postal addresses"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Then there could be a table that defines what fields are used per contact information type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;contact information type fields&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Id: Identifier&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Contact_information_type_id: References the previous table&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Field title: "Address line 1"&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Field description: "Use this line for postal addresses' first line"&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Field type: String/Integer/etc.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Field format: Regular expression for validating field data&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Field order: In which order should this field appear when displaying/using this contact information type&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Then we'd have a "contact information table" that just is used to map contact information fields together:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;contact information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Id: Identifier&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contact_information_type_id: References the contact information type table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Then we'd have a "contact information of person" -table mapping different contact information to persons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;contact information of person&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Id: Identifier&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Contact_information_id: References the contact information table&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Person id: References the person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Then we'd need tables per contact information field type like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;contact information integer fields&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Id: Identifier&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Contact_information_id: References the contact information table&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Value: The value of this field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and so on for strings etc...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally when displaying different contact information of a given person this would happen through &lt;b&gt;person's contact information&lt;/b&gt; -table whis looks up what fields are used to form this contact information from &lt;b&gt;contact information type fields&lt;/b&gt; -table through &lt;b&gt;contact information&lt;/b&gt; -table. After determining what fields are used all the necessary tables would be joined together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm having doubts about the feasibility of in SQL. Any thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Java I probably could program some logic to determine what tables are neede to form a contact information entity and then i could use some sort of dynamic beans to represent this data in Java. But that's a bit foggy to me too. Anyt thoughts on this too?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please explain the rationale behind this. Misunderstanding what Page.Async does may be the cause of your problems.&lt;/strike&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, I was unable to get an example working that reproduced the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; Looking at your code example, I can see that you're not using &lt;code&gt;RegisterAsyncTask()&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;PageAsyncTask&lt;/code&gt; class. I think you must do this when executing asynchronous tasks on a Page where &lt;code&gt;@Async&lt;/code&gt; is set to true. The example from MSDN Magazine looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    PageAsyncTask task = new PageAsyncTask(
        new BeginEventHandler(BeginAsyncOperation),
        new EndEventHandler(EndAsyncOperation),
        new EndEventHandler(TimeoutAsyncOperation),
        null
        );
    RegisterAsyncTask(task);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside &lt;code&gt;BeginAsyncOperation&lt;/code&gt;, then, should you send a mail asynchronously.&lt;/p&gt;

The server and client communicate using .Net-Remoting so currently I am using remoted .Net-Events to get the functionality. But there is one drawback: when the server (the event publisher) comes offline and is restarted, the clients lose the connection since the remote object references become invalid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am looking into Loosely Coupled Events and Transient COM Subscriptions to solve this issue. I put together a small demo application with one publisher and two subscribers. It works beautifully on one computer.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am using the COMAdmin-Libraries to create a transient subscription for the event subscribers. The code looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;MyEventHandler handler = new MyEventHandler();
ICOMAdminCatalog catalog;
ICatalogCollection transientCollection;
ICatalogObject subscription;
catalog = (ICOMAdminCatalog)new COMAdminCatalog();
transientCollection = (ICatalogCollection)catalog.GetCollection("TransientSubscriptions");
subscription = (ICatalogObject)transientCollection.Add();
subscription.set_Value("Name", "SubTrans");
subscription.set_Value("SubscriberInterface", handler);
string eventClassString = "{B57E128F-DB28-451b-99D3-0F81DA487EDE}";
subscription.set_Value("EventCLSID", eventClassString);
string sinkString = "{9A616A06-4F8D-4fbc-B47F-482C24A04F35}";
subscription.set_Value("InterfaceID", sinkString);
subscription.set_Value("FilterCriteria", "");
subscription.set_Value("PublisherID", "");
transientCollection.SaveChanges();
handler.Event1 += OnEvent1;
handler.Event2 += OnEvent2;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question now is: what do I  have to change in the subscription to make this work over a network? Is it even possible?&lt;/p&gt;

This is often the case 'in-house' where a team may care much more about getting an initial version of an app in front of the users quickly than about how fast (or even how stable) it is. Add to this the fact that a well written framework will simplify development of applications that are the target of the framework's design and you'd often be mad NOT to use a framework if one is available. Of course you're taking the risk that the framework will allow you to get 80% of the way to your goal and then leave you high and dry, but, well, you can usually mitigate that by working outside of the framework for that last 20%. Like everything good in software it's often all about layering; you might first select .Net as a 'framework' and then decide to use a particular .Net GUI 'framework' for parts of your app and then, perhaps, a separate socket's 'framework' for other parts. Or, you might decide to work in C++ and use boost as a framework, or, perhaps pick a more focused framework that offers you more abstraction and (hopefully) greater coding speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of matching two slashes specifically, you use &lt;code&gt;..&lt;/code&gt; to match two characters that can be anything at all, presumably because you dont know how to match slashes when youre also using them as delimiters. (Actually, dots match &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; anything, as well see in #3.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within a slash-delimited regex literal, &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt;, you can match slashes simply by protecting them with backslashes, eg. &lt;code&gt;/\/\//&lt;/code&gt;. The nicer variant, however, is to use the longer form of regex literal, &lt;code&gt;m//&lt;/code&gt;, where you can choose the delimiter, eg. &lt;code&gt;m!!&lt;/code&gt;. Since you use something other than slashes for delimitation, you can then write them without escaping them: &lt;code&gt;m!//!&lt;/code&gt;. See &lt;a href="http://p3rl.org/op#Quote-and-Quote-like-Operators"&gt;perldoc perlop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its not anchored to the start of the string so it will match anywhere. Use the &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt; start-of-string assertion in front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You wrote &lt;code&gt;[^\n]&lt;/code&gt; to match any character except newline when there is a much simpler way to write that, which is just the &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; wildcard. It does exactly that  match any character except newline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are using parentheses to group a part of the match, but the group is neither quantified (you are not specifying that it can match any other number of times than exactly once) nor are you interested in keeping it. So the parentheses are superfluous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altogether, that makes it &lt;code&gt;m!^//#.*!&lt;/code&gt;. But putting an uncaptured &lt;code&gt;.*&lt;/code&gt; (or anything with a &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; quantifier) at the end of a regex is meaningless, since it never changes whether a string will match or not: the &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; is happy to match nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that leaves you with &lt;code&gt;m!^//#!&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for removing the line from the file, as everyone else explained, read it in line by line and print all the lines you want to keep back to another file. If you are not doing this within a larger program, use perls command line switches to do it easily:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;perl -ni.bak -e'print unless m!^//#!' somefile.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, the &lt;code&gt;-n&lt;/code&gt; switch makes perl put a loop around the code you provide which will read all the files you pass on the command line in sequence. The &lt;code&gt;-i&lt;/code&gt; switch (for in-place) says to collect the output from your script and overwrite the original contents of each file with it. The &lt;code&gt;.bak&lt;/code&gt; parameter to the &lt;code&gt;-i&lt;/code&gt; option tells perl to keep a backup of the original file in a file named after the original file name with &lt;code&gt;.bak&lt;/code&gt; appended. For all of these bits, see &lt;a href="http://p3rl.org/run"&gt;perldoc perlrun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to do this within the context of a larger program, the easiest way to do it safely is to open the file twice, once for reading, and separately, with &lt;a href="http://p3rl.org/IO::AtomicFile"&gt;IO::AtomicFile&lt;/a&gt;, another time for writing. IO::AtomicFile will replace the original file only if its successfully closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only in special cases would I specify the argument type in the method name, i.e. if the type of argument is difficult to determine, if there are several types of arguments tha has the same data type (batchId and employeeId, both int), or if the methods for retrieving the employee is radically different for each argument type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't see why I'd ever use this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;getEmployeeName(int typeOfIdentifier, byte[] identifier)

&lt;p&gt;as it requires both callee and caller to cast the value based on typeOfIdentifier. Bad design.&lt;/p&gt;

It will do your asynchronous work, give you notifications of important events, and has ways to better integrate with your forms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you can activate progress notifications by registering a handler for the ProgressChanged event. (which is highly recommended if you have a long, asynchronous process and you don't want your user to think the application froze)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I guess the answer to this is easy and everyone knows it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens if you change the Employee class? E.g.: You have to remove the email and add a new filter like department. With the second solution you have a huge risk of not noticing any errors if you just change the order of the int identifier "constants".
With the first solution you will always notice if you are using the method in some long forgotten classes you would otherwise forget to modify to the new identifier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reasons for using Widows Server 2008 as a development environment on a laptop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;64-Bit, so you get the full use of 4GB RAM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SharePoint developer, so you can run SharePoint locally and debug successfully.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hyper-V, so you get hardware virtualisation of test environments and the ability to demo full solutions stored in Hyper-V on the road&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So all of that equals: Windows Server 2008 (64) on a laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now because we are running Hyper-V, we require a large volume of disk space. This means we are using 5,000 rpm 250GB HDD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are on a laptop, we are not able to use solid state HDD, and we only have 4GB of RAM and the throughput of a laptop motherboard rather than a server one... all of which means we are not flying... this thing isn't a sluggard but it's not zippy either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows Server 2008 is based on the same code base as Vista. Vista features ReadyBoost, which enables USB 2 flash devices to be used as a weak cache for system files, which visibly increases the performance of Vista. As the codebases are similar, it should be possible for ReadyBoost to work on WS2008, however Microsoft have not shipped or enabled ReadyBoost in WS2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that we are running WS2008 on a laptop as a development environment, how can we achieve the performance gains of ReadyBoost through the use of flash devices in Windows Server 2008?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the answer to be accepted it must outline an end to end process for achieving the performance gain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answers of 'No' will not be accepted as I understand some third party tools achieve some of the functionality, but I haven't seen a full end-to-end description of how to get going with them.&lt;/p&gt;

In that case, I'd do something similar to your second option, but instead of using ints, I'd use an Enum for type safety and clarity.

The debate continues at this moment on blogs, forums, and Slashdot comment threads. Some people say that bad usability is endemic to the entire OSS world, while others say that OSS usability is great but that the real problem is the closed-minded users who expect every program to clone Microsoft. Some people contend that UI problems are temporary growing pains, while others say that the OSS development model systematically produces bad UI. Some people even argue that the GPL indirectly rewards software thats difficult to use! (For the record, I disagree.)&lt;/p&gt;

But even in this case is easy.
Here is the function/method creating a thread:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;struct myparams {
int x;
std::vector&amp;lt;double&amp;gt; z;
}

std::auto_ptr&amp;lt;myparams&amp;gt; param(new myparams(x, ...));
// Release the ownership in case thread creation is successfull
if (0 == pthread_create(&amp;amp;th, NULL, th_func, param.get()) param.release();
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here instead the thread function&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;extern "C" void* th_func(void* p) {
   try {
       std::auto_ptr&amp;lt;myparams&amp;gt; param((myparams*)p);
       ...
   } catch(...) {
   }
   return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty easyn isn't it? In case the thread creation fails the resource will be free'd (deleted) by the auto_ptr, otherwise the ownership will be passed to the thread.
What if the thread is so fast that after creation it releases the resource before the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;param.release();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;gets called in the main function/method? Nothing! Because we will 'tell' the auto_ptr to ignore the deallocation.
Is C++ memory management easy isn't it?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market -  There must be a market for your open source project. If your project is a orange juicer in space, I doubt that you'll be very successful. You must make sure your project gets a large adoption amongst users and developers. It is twice as likely to succeed if you can get other corporations to adopt it as well. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation - As you touched on earlier documentation is key. Amongst this documentation is commented code, architectural decisions, and API notes. Even if your documentation contains bugs, or bugs about your software it is ok. Remember, transparency is key. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freedom - You must allow your code to be "free" - by this I mean free as in speech, not as in beer. If you have a feeling your market is being a library for other corporations a BSD license is optimal. If your piece of software is going to run on desktops then GPL is your choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transparency - You must write software in a transparent environment. Once you go open source there is no hidden secrets. You must explain everything you do, and what you are doing. This will piss off developers like no other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developer Community - A strong developer community is required. This must be existing. Only about 5% of users contribute back to the project.  If someone notices there haven't been any releases for a year they wont think "Wow, this piece of software is done," they will think "developers must of dumped it." Keep your developers working on it, even if it means they are costing you money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communications - You must make sure you community is able to communicate. They must be able to file bugs, discuss workarounds, and publish patches. Without feedback, it is pointless to opensource the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Availability - Making your code easy to get is necessary, even if it means pissing off lawyers. You have to make sure your project is easy to download, and utilize. You don't want the user to have to jump through 18 nag screens and sign a contract in order to do this. You have to make things simple, and clean&lt;/li&gt;

What this means is that you will not be able to actually implement all features that make CMS users happy. Not even most features. I want to clarify that by CMS I actually mean a platform for creating web applications or web sites, not a blogging platform or a scaled-down version. From personal experience I can tell you the things I want most in a CMS.&lt;br /&gt;
1. Extensible - provide a clean and robust API so that a programmer can do most things through code, instead of using the UI&lt;br /&gt;
2. Easy page creation and editing - use templates, have several URLs for a single page, provide options for URL rewriting&lt;br /&gt;
3. Make it component-based. Allow users to add custom functionality. Make it easy for someone to add his code to do something&lt;br /&gt;
4. Make it SEO-friendly. This includes metadata, again URL rewriting, good sitemap, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now there are these enterprise features that I also like, but i doubt you'll have the desire to dive into their implementation from the beginning. They include workflow (an approval process for content-creation, customizable), Built-in modules for common functionality (blogs, e-commerce, news), ability to write own modules, permissions for different users, built-in syndication, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all I speak from a developer's point of view and my opinion might not be mainstream, so you have to decide on your own in the end. Just as ahockley said - you have to know why you need to build your own CMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use IntSmarty to localize our website, and store the localized strings in a database using our own wrapper. In its destructor, IntSmarty saves any new strings that it might have, resulting in a database call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use a Singleton instance of MDB2 to do queries against MySQL, and after connecting we used the SetCharset()-function to change the character set to UTF-8. We found that strings that were saved by IntSmarty were interpreted as ISO-8859-1 when the final inserts were made. We looked closely at the query log, and found that the MySQL connection got disconnected before IntSmarty's destructor got called. It then got reestablished, but no "SET NAMES utf8" query was issued on the new connection. This resulted that the saved strings got interpreted as ISO-8859-1 by MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be no options that set the default character set on MDB2. Our solution to this problem was changing the MySQL server configuration, by adding&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;init-connect='SET NAMES utf8'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to my.cnf. This only solves the problem that our character set is always the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, is there any way that I can prevent the connection from being torn down before all the queries have been run? Can I force the MDB2 instance to be destructed after everything else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning on persistent connections works, but is not a desired answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of OneNote with a tablet PC is awesome! I was a bit of a skeptic at first. I used the trial version and then forgot about it. A year later I had an unruly collection of files, project related emails, notebooks and scraps of paper all scattered throughout my life. I went back to OneNote and all my problems went away. Some highlights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything is searchable. The character recognition is good enough that my chicken-scratch meeting notes can be searched. Text within images is searchable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OneNote syncs with Outlook so finding meeting notes is a breeze.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I now embed all files into OneNote - pdfs, spreadsheets, word docs, images, web clippings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OneNote is constantly saving all changes so, combined with a scheduled automated backup, everything is in one place and is safe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are some built-in collaboration tools I have yet to try but that look useful.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If its a regular web application like gmail and you want it to work on lots of browsers and platforms; then I'd recommend a combination of HTML, CSS and &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/" rel="nofollow"&gt;GWT&lt;/a&gt; as this means your application code is all Java, its very easy to refactor modularise and maintain, there's a ton of Java programmers out there and the IDEs for Java are awesome (IntelliJ or eclipse etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can then use browser plugins like Siverlight or Flex if and when they make sense (e.g. like &lt;a href="http://finance.google.com/finance" rel="nofollow"&gt;Google finance&lt;/a&gt; uses Flash for interactive graphs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your application is highly graphical like a Visio type of thing or needs to embed Microsoft Office or something;  you might wanna look at Silverlight/Flex/AIR particularly if you can kinda dictate the browser versions and platforms for an internal application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though with client side there's no clear single answer (just look at the comments on this thread :) there are many options (Java Applets/Swing/JavaFX, Ajax, GWT, Air/Flex, Silverlight/.Net etc) which all have strengths and weaknesses. My recommendation for the communication between the client and your C++ server would be to expose your C++ application as a set of RESTful resources - then at any point in time you can easily write other kinds of clients in any language technology or framework.&lt;/p&gt;

It's something which is commonly used across applications of different flavours and indeed something which most GUI libraries (well, those that I know) deliver in some way. While it's not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; difficult to write your own, it's not trivial either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I'm interested in finding out if anyone can rationalise this omission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;edit: Thanks for the suggestions. Whilst masked text boxes and numeric up-downs have their place; I am interested in a control that looks like a text box but automatically performs validation on key press that the input corresponds to a valid number. In my (admittedly limited) experience, this is something which is used quite a bit (we don't always want the static constraints imposed by masked text boxes, just as we don't always want the up-down controls at the side). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of implementations with varying degrees of quality of this on the net and indeed there's even an example of this on the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229644.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;MSDN&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;edit2: Thanks guys, so it sounds like the numeric up-down is the .NET control to use for numeric input only (and the reason why we don't actually have an explicit numeric text box control). It would have been great if it automatically disallowed the input of non-numeric characters (on keypress, on paste etc) but I guess it's good enough that it performs the validation when the control loses focus. And, one could do the on keypress, on paste validation if one were really keen... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;
I downloaded this yesterday and gave it a whirl on our site.  The site is large, complex and uses a lot of javascript, css, ajax, jquery etc as well as URL rewriters and so on.  The installation was too easy to be true and I had to bang my head against it a few times to get it to work.  The trick... entries in the correct place in the web.config and a close read through the AdvancedSetup.txt to flip settings manually.  The site renders &lt;strong&gt;mostly&lt;/strong&gt; correctly but there are a few issues which are probably due to the naming off css classed - it will require some close attention and a lot of testing to make sure that it fits, but so far it looks good and well worth the cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second Update&lt;/strong&gt; We are busy trying to get RPO hooked up.  There are a couple of problems with character encoding and possibly with the composition of some of our scripts.  I have to point out that the response and support from the vendor has been very positive and proactive&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third Update&lt;/strong&gt; I went ahead and went ahead with the process of getting RPO integrated into the site that I was involved in.  Although there were some hiccups, the RPO people were very helpful and put a lot of effort into improving the product and making it fit in our environment.  It is definitely a no-brainer to use RPO - the cost for features means that it is simple to just go ahead and implement it.  Job done.  Move on to next task&lt;/p&gt;

These are general purpose code to sort arrays and to search for data in a pre-sorted array.  They work on any type of data structure - but you pass them a pointer to a helper function that does the comparisons.  The helper function knows the details of the structure, and therefore does the comparison correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, since you are wanting to do searches, it may be that all you need is bsearch(), though if you are building the data structures on the fly, you may decide you need a different structure than a sorted list.  (You can use sorted lists -- it just tends to slow things down compared with, say, a heap.  However, you'd need a general heap_search() function, and a heap_insert() function, to do the job properly, and such functions are not standardized in C.   Searching the web shows such functions exist - not by that name; just do not try "c heap search" since it is assumed you meant "cheap search" and you get tons of junk!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;"-foo foo foo"

&lt;p&gt;only matches twice. It appears that the leading character causes the engine to skip to the right side of the expression and since it's broadly defined, it captures until the next word break.

&lt;p&gt;Yes it appears to be that some of these paths from these package installs are too long for Windows. Since I use phpStorm already (&lt;a href="https://laracasts.com/forum/?p=1757-slow-responses-on-homestead/0" rel="nofollow"&gt;since it will keep server pages loading faster on the VM&lt;/a&gt;) here's what I did:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSH into the VM and create a folder called &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; in your project's directory (the directory where package.json is).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In phpStorm, go to &lt;code&gt;File &amp;gt; Settings &amp;gt; Build, Execution, Deployment &amp;gt; Deployment&lt;/code&gt; and click on the &lt;code&gt;Excluded Paths&lt;/code&gt; tab. Click the &lt;code&gt;Add deployment path&lt;/code&gt; button and add the folder &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; from step 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSH back into the VM and in your projects folder (should be directory folder with package.json) and run this command: &lt;code&gt;install npm&lt;/code&gt;. This will install all packages listed in your package.json file locally to the directory you are in, and will put the necessary files into the folder &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now run the gulp command: &lt;code&gt;gulp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is what I understand for SSL communication. The browser gets public key from the web server of the secured website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it gets the entire certificate, which contains the public key, and it gets a lot of other things too, that authenticate that the server owns that certificate, and therefore owns that public key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The client and server establish session key based on public/private keys&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incorrect. They negotiate a session key based on shared secrets that don't have anything to do with the public or private keys. The public key may be used to encrypt one of those secrets between client and server, but that's a different statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;and then continue communication through symmetric algorithm during the SSL session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My questions:&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;After session key is generated, where does it stored in server side? Is it stored in web server memory?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And is it stored as encrypted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the easiest way to do this us using the &lt;a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/map/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;$map&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; operator introduced in MongoDB 2.6. It transforms arrays so that is what you basically do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;db.collection.aggregate([
    { "$project": {
        "names": { "$map": {
            "input": { "$literal": ["first","last"] },
            "as": "el",
            "in": { "$cond": [
                { "$eq": [ "$$el", "first" ] },
                "$senderName",
                "$receiverName"
            ]}
        }}
    }}
])
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternately you can do a similar process with earlier versions that don't support the operator, but not really efficiently:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"&gt;&lt;code&gt;db.collection.aggregate([
    { "$project": { 
        "senderName": 1,
        "receiverName": 1,
        "type": { "$const": [ "first", "last" ] }
    }},
    { "$unwind": "$type" },
    { "$group": {
        "_id": "$_id",
        "names": { "$push": { "$cond": [
            { "$eq": [ "$type", "first" ] },
            "$senderName",
            "$receiverName"   
        ]}}
    }}
])
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But since in either case you are not really aggregating anything it is a fair argument to use a similar &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; approach in client code by your languages own supported operation for this. But if you need to use it for some stage of your aggregation then you have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can still do it though, and that is how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oxford American Dictionary(1980):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;n. a part of a sentence that says something about the grammatical subject, as "is short" in "life is short"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is another sentence: "John is tall." the predicate is "is tall". As you can see it modifies or describes the subject, another term that is similar to &lt;code&gt;predicate&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;adjective&lt;/code&gt;. In essence it's a modifier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM's technology &lt;a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/globalization/terminology/p.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;glossary&lt;/a&gt; provides several definitions but, the one fits best is this one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An expression used as part of a filter, consisting of a data item, an operator, and a value&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example using SQL:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT name
FROM tableA
WHERE name = "john";
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The predicate in this code would be &lt;code&gt;name = "john"&lt;/code&gt;. It has all the components of the IBM definition and also fits with the regular definition of predicate. The subject being &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; and the predicate being &lt;code&gt;name = "john"&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example a &lt;code&gt;RUN&lt;/code&gt; command might take 20 minutes to run, that downloads, compiles, and installs a binary. Is it possible to take a diff of that and apply it to another image?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way I can think of (which I haven't attempted yet) is to run &lt;code&gt;docker diff&lt;/code&gt;, parse the output, create a tgz, then use the tgz as an &lt;code&gt;ADD&lt;/code&gt; in another &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that there are issues with this, e.g. if an &lt;code&gt;apt-get update&lt;/code&gt; is called beforehand which might break an expected dynamic library linkage for the binary, etc. I'm OK with this as my tests will fail, and will show that I have to rebuild the "diff" again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also realise there could be conflicts. I'm happy to replace the file completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for this functionality is to save time. For example sometimes early &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt; commands need to be changed, and will break the cache. Also, as much as I try to make them identical to take advantage of cache, it is not always possible for the preceding commands in two different Dockerfiles to be the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above lines, I understand that the projection matrix and modelview matrix are being uploaded. I would like to know the math behind this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have some 3d vertices (overlayvertices) which are later passed in this manner:    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Upload overlay vertices                      
gl.bindBuffer(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, overlayVertices[elementIndex]);
gl.vertexAttribPointer(shaderProgram.aVertexPosition, 3, gl.FLOAT,false, 0, 0);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where overlayvertices[i] is a 4*1 array with x,y,z,1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final drawing happens on the frame of a particular camera based on which the modelview and projection matrix is determined. I would like to manually get the transformed vertices in the camera frame. i.e, (x,y,1). I later download the data within each frame and hence the x,y should be pixel coordinates. Since this happens internally in webgl, I am not able to retrieve this information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First solution I tried is &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"&gt;

}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However both of them did not work. It compiled, but since I am new to coding, I got no clue if I applied the code at the right place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need to make some changes to get this to work. Move the span from outside to inside the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a href&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;then apply the &lt;code&gt;position:relative&lt;/code&gt; to the  by adding a class. See the updated code below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;IFieldRepository repository = unitOfWork.FieldRepository;
repository.GetAllFields();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need either cast it to &lt;code&gt;EFGenericRepository&amp;lt;Field&amp;gt;, IFieldRepository&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;em&gt;don't do it!&lt;/em&gt;) or add this method to the interface:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public interface IFieldRepository
{
    void Insert(Field entity);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being &lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt; doesn't make any difference here, you can remove it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But instead I'd have a generic interface for all repositories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public interface IRepository&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;
{
    IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; GetAll(int page, int amount, string sortByKey, SortDirection sortDirection);

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public interface IRepository&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;
{
    IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; GetAll();

    IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; GetAll(int page, int amount, Expression&amp;lt;Func&amp;lt;IQueryable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;, Func&amp;lt;T, object&amp;gt;, IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sort);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;repository.GetAll(x, y, (seq, p) =&amp;gt; seq.OrderBy(p =&amp;gt; p.Name));

I am using the Altera DE1 board with Quartus II Software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is something I cannot figure out.  I have code as follows to instantiate a module:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;reg [9:0] x0;
initial begin
    x0 = 10'd200;
end

linepro linedrawer1 
     (.CLOCK(I_CLK),
     .RST(reset_drawer),
      .done(drawer_done),
     .x0(x0), 
     .y0(10'd200), 
     .x1(10'd500), 
     .y1(10'd100), 
     .outx(x), 
     .outy(y)); 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I am hooking an initialized reg directly to the port of my linepro module.  This code appears to work under simulation, but does NOT correctly initialize x0 on the fpga board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make this code work properly, and the linepro module be instantiated correctly, I make the following slight modification:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;reg [9:0] x0reg;
wire [9:0] x0;
assign x0=x0reg;
initial begin
    x0reg = 10'd200;
end

linepro linedrawer1 
     (.CLOCK(I_CLK),
     .RST(reset_drawer),
      .done(drawer_done),
     .x0(x0), 
     .y0(10'd200), 
     .x1(10'd500), 
     .y1(10'd100), 
     .outx(x), 
     .outy(y)); 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, I assign the reg to a wire and hook the wire into the linepro module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the difference, if any, between &lt;strong&gt;using a reg directly to instantiate a module&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;assigning a reg to a wire and using that wire to instantiate the module&lt;/strong&gt;?  What are some reasons one method might work and the other might not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance for any assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;if u add vertical-align: top; to #left_bar a the align problem will be gone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;when you float something, its gonna stand in its original height. and as the #left_bar is there filling the whole row, #right_bar falls down. to fix it you should put #right_bar div before #left_bar like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the current setup put an image on your webserver and try to retrieve it in the browser using the exact address. Do this on the server itself first and if that works then do it on a client machine.
If it works on server but not on client then there could be a client browser issue/a network issue/a dns issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it doesn't work on the server then change the file level and IIS permissions to anonymous for just that image and the folder / website it is in. Then test the URL on the server in a browser and on a client in a browser.
If it works you've got a permissions issue with NTLM.&lt;/p&gt;

From what you have presented, I would start with the following specific indexes... these are all covering indexes to qualify all the joins and criteria you will be working with.  Covering indexes help the engine because the engine can get all the data that qualify without having to go to the raw data pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most specifically, starting with your journey table, I would explicitly have the composite index based on all 3 fields in the order I have them...  Day first as that is your WHERE criteria, then ID as that is the GROUP BY and finally DEPARTURE for your ORDER BY clause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LINK table based on section and stop first as those are the criteria as joined to the journey table.  ID next as it is basis of joining to LINK2, and finally ELAPSED for your field criteria selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Sumoanand: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also faced similar problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;This issue occurs if app is not registered properly in google developer console.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you have registered app on Google developer Console using production keystore certificate fingerprint(SHA1) where as you are testing it on app which has debug keystore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perform following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Create one more client Id using debug keystore certificate fingerprint(SHA1).
Uninstall existing app.
Install app &amp;amp; connect to Google fit.
Check under google fit app &amp;amp; make sure that your app is listed as a connected app (... &amp;gt; Settings &amp;gt; Connected apps &amp;gt; Connected apps &amp;amp; devices).
Now run the above code &amp;amp; it will work !!!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem that I'm facing is that noun1 wont cooperate with me in the aspect of it will not carry though from one parameter to the other. I need noun1 to carry from on=1 to on=0 so that when the method is called for a second time it reads "Be kind to your (insert noun1)". I cant seem to figure out how to carry it over. This is only a section of my lab, but if I can figure out how to do this, I can implicate it into my other methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 7 (of 100+ total) machines sending syslog data the license reports show lots (more than 10x the 'normal machines) of data usage, but if i query for data from those hosts I either find very little data or no data at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've confirmed i'm searching all indexes that exist. I've also confirmed those machines are sending data by blocking the UDP port outbound and confirming splunk stopped receiving data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next steps are:
attempt to confirm at machine source how much UDP data it's sending and compare to amount recorded by indexer 
confirm setup of wonky-behaving machines to be very sure there isn't some delta in the system or syslog configuration causing a lot of data to be generated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have advice for troubleshooting data that's recorded by the indexer but not actually stored? I'm wondering if it's possible that these hosts are so noisy they've effectively been cut off with regard to saving their events.&lt;/p&gt;

First, you don't use a local webserver like XAMPP. Although it's not really necessary for HTML-only websites, it has real benefits to use in development. If you plan to learn PHP you will need it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, you are using directories, which are not handled very well without a webserver and proper knowledge. As you already expirienced, the correct notation of the URL is very important. So, like Mike already stated, making the links absolute will help.
But the problem then is, before uploading to a real webserver, you have to clean up all the links. A tedious and unnecessary action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution is: don't use directories for content. While it's OK to use folders for images, scripts, CSS and so on, it's almost never needed, to store content pages into directories. Just use the name of the category as filename like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;department.html
regulations.html
contact.html
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need some subpages in this categories, just add them with a dash like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;department-office.html
department-accounting.html
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way you have a clean and readable filenaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that, a part of me thinks its a good idea to store these 18 fields as &lt;code&gt;smallint&lt;/code&gt;s and remember to perform all further queries and calculations at that scale. Then I'd only have to worry about readjusting final values at the view layer, which I already have to do anyway (e.g. 0.333333 -&gt; 0.33, 23.111111 -&gt; 23%). Performance advantages here are obvious, but I'm not sure how significant they are in the grand scheme of things (we're talking about 10K-30K records per day): I'd be storing half the amount of data and any future computations and serializations in the app would involve integers instead of floating point numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's another part of me that thinks I'll pay for this decision somehow in the future, since it somewhat compromises the ergonomics of the code since I'll need to keep track of which columns map to which numeric format (&lt;code&gt;X.XX&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;XX.XX&lt;/code&gt;) throughout development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;

/**

 *
 * @ORM\Table(name="city")
 * @ORM\Entity

class City
{
    /**

     * @ORM\Id
     * @ORM\GeneratedValue(strategy="IDENTITY")
     */
    protected $id;

    /**
     * @var string
     *
     * @ORM\Column(name="city", type="string", length=15, nullable=false)
     */
    protected $city;

    /**
     * Set city
     *
     * @param string $city
     * @return City
     */
    public function setCity($city)
    {
        $this-&amp;gt;city = $city;

        return $this;
    }

    /**
     * Get city
     *

     */
    public function getCity()
    {
        return $this-&amp;gt;city;
    }

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a form class you could add City as an entity type (see Chausser's answer for documentation reference).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city's name could be returned in a controller with something like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$em = $this-&amp;gt;getDoctrine()-&amp;gt;getManager();
$city = $em-&amp;gt;getRepository("YourBundle:City")-&amp;gt;find($id);
$cityName = $city-&amp;gt;getCity();

The workflow would go like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The page would be loaded like normal. Only the markup that contains the part you want visible during loading should be in this page. It should also contain JavaScript to create an AJAX request back to the server that executes upon the page load. This JavaScript will typically be what shows the "loading" prompt (usually with an animated GIF). It helps to facilitate AJAX through a JavaScript framework such as JQuery or AngularJS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In ASP.NET, you can respond to an AJAX request either by making a static method on the page or by creating an HTTP handler. You could simplify the process a little by using WebApi. This method is responsible for returning the remaining part of the page. This can be the result of a user control that is executed server side to produce an HTML string, markup that is generated manually, or you can just return a model as JSON and then use JavaScript to generate the HTML on the client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon the second return trip from the server, the AJAX callback function is executed and it adds the necessary HTML to the DOM and then hides the "loading" prompt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of moving parts and it takes some work (and some searching) to put together, but it is doable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var str = "This is a string";
var strChars = str.ToCharArray();  // returns array
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that modification of "strChars" will not mutate the original "str" object, irrespective implementation-level knowledge of "str"'s underlying type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But suppose that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var str = "This is a string";
var strChars = str.ToCharList();  // returns List&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;
strChars.Insert(0, 'X');
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, it's not clear from that code-snippet alone if the insert method will or will not mutate the original "str" object. It requires implementation level knowledge of String to make that determination, which breaks Design by Contract approach. In the case of String, it's not a big deal, but it can be a big deal in almost every other case. Setting the List to read-only does help but results in run-time errors, not compile-time.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm getting this error whenever I try and build my project on Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop, Just a standard Windows Form Application project.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Id="28868504" PostTypeId="1" CreationDate="2015-03-05T01:37:49.937" Score="0" ViewCount="33" Body="&lt;p&gt;The application I'm working on at the moment is heavily multi-threaded, with a number of resources that are shared between threads. I use QMutexes in order to protect the shared resources, though in practice there should only very rarely be contention between different threads trying to lock the same mutex at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I find with distressing frequency that my application grinds to a juddering halt. When I break execution and check what's going on I find that a thread is stalled because it can't obtain a lock on the required mutex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've checked that the mutexes are always locked and unlocked from the same thread - indeed, almost always within the same curly-bracket block - and in my latest round of troubleshooting I've replaced all my bare QMutexes with 'nMutex' objects defined as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class nMutex : public QMutex
{
public:
    nMutex() : QMutex(),
               locks(0),  
    {}

    void lock(const char * callingFilename, int callingLineNo) 
    { 
        // QMutex::lock();     // Frequently hangs, so tried the following instead...
        if (!tryLock(1000))
        {
            printf("Cannot obtain mutex at line %d of %s; locks = %d",
                   callingLineNo, callingFilename, locks);
        }
        else
        {
            if (isRecursive())
                ++locks;
            else
                locks = 1;
        }
    }

    bool tryLock(int timeout = 0)  // Hides rather than overrides QMutex's tryLock, 
                                   // which is not virtual
    {
        bool result = QMutex::tryLock(timeout);
        if (result)
        {
            if (isRecursive())
                ++locks;
            else
                locks = 1; 
        }
        return result;
    }

    bool isLocked() const { return (locks &amp;gt; 0); }

    int lockDepth() const { return locks; }

    void unlock()
    {
        if (!locks) return;
        QMutex::unlock();
        if (isRecursive())
            --locks;
        else
            locks = 0; 
    }

private:
    int locks;
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...and replaced all my calls to mutex.lock() with &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mutex.lock(__FILE__, __LINE__).
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I find is that this quite often fails, and when it does it always reports "locks = 0" - in other words, no other thread has the mutex already, and yet the thread that's trying to get it, can't get it. Failures occur seemingly randomly, regardless of where in my code the call to mutex.lock() is made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present I can see two possibilites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) I'm being very stupid, and am failing to see something wrong with the above approach, or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) There's a bug in QMutex. This seems unlikely since I've seen no reports, and I've tried this in at least three versions of Qt 5.3 and 5.4 (including the very latest 5.4.1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a way of testing which of these two possibilities is most likely to be correct? For example, in cases where a mutex cannot be obtained, is there a way of finding out specifically why that is?&lt;/p&gt;

I am trying to populate a text box on &lt;strong&gt;form 1&lt;/strong&gt; with data returned from &lt;strong&gt;form 2&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the code used to navigate to &lt;strong&gt;form 2&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;this.Frame.Navigate(typeof(form 2));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I know you can pass a parameter back to &lt;strong&gt;form 1&lt;/strong&gt; using this method, but when back is pressed it would go to &lt;strong&gt;form 2&lt;/strong&gt; which is not ideal as I want it to go back to &lt;strong&gt;form 0&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you return data using this or something similar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; Frame.GoBack();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, are the only methods for transferring data between pages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;pass a handler to a previous Page, so you can access public variables/properties from current Page,&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;use a static variable/property - maybe a singleton&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;again use files/settings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize the options from there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a new boolean field called 'has_target_date'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a default target_date (eg 1/1/1970) to mean that it doesn't exist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hack: (range field=target_date [0,})&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any of those options should work with the QUERY_GOES_HERE portion of your question.&lt;/p&gt;

Save the word document as an new-intranetfile.HTM. Rename the intranetfile.HTM to old-intranetfile.HTM and rename new-intranetfile.HTM to intranetfile.HTM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you should be able to open the HTM file in word again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My guess is that when you saved intranetfile.HTM from DreamWeaver it added dreamweaver code which confuses word. Or the hidden files that word saves when it saves an HTM document no longer linked correctly to the intranetfile.HTM and that was the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

Now I want to take it one step further. First off, here's the source:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class GUI extends JPanel {
private final static int MAX_X = 1920;
private final static int MAX_Y = 1080;

public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
    super.paintComponent(g);

    for (int x = 0; x &amp;lt; MAX_X; x++) {
        for (int y = 0; y &amp;lt; MAX_Y; y++) {

            Color randomColor = Color.BLACK; //Black because it wouldn't work uninitialized.

            //Slightly inefficient? 
            int number; Random rColor = new Random();
            number = rColor.nextInt(3);

             if(number == 0){randomColor = Color.RED;}
             else if(number ==1){randomColor = Color.GREEN;}
             else if(number == 2){randomColor = Color.BLUE;}


            g.setColor(randomColor); //Red, Blue, or Green. Depends on if number is 0, 1 or 2.
            g.drawRect(x, y, 1, 1); 
        }


    }

}

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works, and it works like how I expect. Here's the next challenge: How can I make them continuously change? What I want is, if a neighboring pixel is blue than have the pixel be green and then any green to red and red to blue. I'm not sure with how it currently is setup that it'll be possible. Any theories at least would help a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side note: I have a feeling there's a way to minimize those couple lines of code I labeled in a comment as "Slightly Inefficient" into something cleaner like inside parameters. I've been looking up documentation for a while but I can't find a more functional use for Random.&lt;/p&gt;

  reactElements

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create an empty sorted map \&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a 64 bit counter (you don't need more than 2^63 inputs, in all probability, since you would be dead before they would be calculated - unless quantum crypto &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; takes off)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use the counter as input, probably easiest to encode it in 8 bytes;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use this as input for your hash function;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;encode output of hash in hex (use ASCII bytes, for speed);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sort hex on number / alphabetically (same thing really)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;check if sorted hex result is a key in the map&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if it is, show hex result, the old counter from the map &amp;amp; the current counter (and stop)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if it isn't, put the sorted hex result in the map, with the counter as value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increase counter, goto 3&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know why you want to do this for hex, the hashes will be so large that they won't look too much alike. If your alphabet is smaller, your code will run (even) quicker. If you use whole output bytes (i.e. &lt;code&gt;00&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;FF&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;F&lt;/code&gt;) instead of hex, it will take much more time - a quick (non-optimized) test on my machine shows it doesn't finish in minutes and then runs out of memory.&lt;/p&gt;

The page is processed by the server and the full results are then sent to the client.  The client gets nothing until the server is done.  What you want to do is more advanced than this basic model allows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now there are options to do what you want.  It requires more advanced techniques than the basic, old school, web design used by most folks.  Start with AJAX, learning about it will show you new ways of doing things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, have a look a jQuery.  This will simplify AJAX for you.  You need to know AJAX basics before you do this.&lt;/p&gt;

${project.basedir}.clover\cloverMerge.db
&amp;lt;/cloverMergeDatabase&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create your Unit Tests to Run in &lt;strong&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;setup a &lt;em&gt;Before launch&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Run Maven Goal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/yrevJ.png" alt="Run Configuration for Unit tests screen"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a Maven Run Configuration 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the Unit-Tests a &lt;em&gt;Before launch&lt;/em&gt; condition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the command line have Maven run &lt;code&gt;clover2:aggregrate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rYJnL.png" alt="Run Configuration to have Maven Run the tests and aggregate the results"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update Intellij Project Settings for clover to point to the merge file
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure the &lt;strong&gt;Relative to project directory.&lt;/strong&gt; checkbox is checked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;InitString&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;em&gt;User specified&lt;/em&gt; with the value the same as your pom file.&lt;br&gt;
in my case:  &lt;strong&gt;.clover\cloverMergeDB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8tcfS.png" alt="Settings Screen with CheckBox Checked and File name"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the command is run, just click the &lt;em&gt;Referesh Coverage&lt;/em&gt; icon to see and work with the coverage data in idea.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the tests fail you will also have the nice &lt;em&gt;IntelliJ Test runner Tab&lt;/em&gt; to figure out why.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few problems and solutions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you change the value of a string in java, the string is not actually overwritten. Instead, a new string is created to replace the old one. However, the old string still exists. This can be a problem when using RAM efficiently is a concern. Here are some solutions to this problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When using a string to specify something like the "state" of an object or anything else that can only have a specific set of possible values, don't use a string. Instead use an enum. If you don't know what an enum is or how to use one yet, &lt;a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html%20%22here&amp;#39;s%20a%20link%20to%20a%20tutorial%20on%20what%20they%20are%20and%20how%20to%20use%20them." rel="nofollow"&gt;here's a link to a tutorial on what enums are and how to use them!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are using a string as a variable who's value will change at some point in the program, don't define a string how you usually would. Instead, use the StringBuilder class from the java.lang package. StringBuilder is a class which is used to create strings and change their values. This class handles strings differently than usual. When it is used to change the value of a string, StringBuilder doesn't create a duplicate string with a different value to replace the old string, it actually changes the value of the original string. Therefore, since you aren't creating duplicate strings, this saves RAM. &lt;a href="http://cs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/StringBuilder.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Here is a link to to the StringBuilder class in the java api.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writer and reader objects such as fileWriters and fileReaders also take up RAM. If you have a lot of them, this can also cause problems. Here are some solutions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All reader and writer objects have a method called close(). As you can probably guess, it closes the writer or reader object. All it does is get rid of the reader or writer object. Whenever you have a reader or writer object and you reach the point in your code when you know you will never use the reader or writer object anymore, use this method. It will get rid of the reader or writer object and will free some RAM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every object in java takes up memory. When you have an object that you won't use anymore, it's not very convenient to keep it around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Object class has a method called finalize(). This method has the same effect as the close() method in reader and writer objects. When you aren't going to use an object anymore, use the finalize() method to get rid of it and free some RAM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One approach would be to put error checking on each of the variables you're setting so the code can keep working, or export to a text file all the data and go through it using excel and look for unusual or strange control characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the error always occurs at a certain person you could just look at the properties of that user and hope to find the issue that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our issue was the use of Chinese simplified characters in some fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps you track down your issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also - is it possible to have RM automatically release whenever a new build is dropped, WITHOUT installing the RM agent on the build server, and without writing extra REST services etc - simply via tool configuration?

I am completing a sample project and am trying to work out the following use case but am stuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A customer cancels their membership and does not return a rented DVD, necessitating that a $25 DVD replacement fee be charged to their account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tables involved:  Customer, Rented_out, Bill&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, I am trying to create a trigger than will execute if the following conditions are true in order to insert an entry into the bill table:
1. Customer_status in the customer table is updated to 'Inactive'
2. In Rented_out table, that updated customer has a NULL value for the date_returned block (meaning an unreturned DVD).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is what I wrote but right now the trigger executes any time a customer's status is changed (to any value), not specifically to 'Inactive' and regardless of whether or not they have a NULL value in the date_returned block of the rented_out table.  I am unable to figure out how to apply those restrictions.  Also, it is possible for the customer to have multiple rented out items so the $25 fee being entered into the bill table would need to be multiplied by the number of NULL values in the rented_out table for that customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize you might need the rest of the code so if that's the case, please don't hesitate to ask.&lt;/p&gt;

    DECLARE @bill_payment_due_date DATE;
    SET @bill_number = ((SELECT MAX(bill_number) +1 FROM bill));
    SET @customer_id = (SELECT customer_id FROM inserted);
    SET @bill_amount_due = 25.00;
    SET @bill_payment_due_date = GETDATE()+30;
        IF UPDATE (customer_status)
            INSERT INTO bill(bill_number, customer_id, bill_amount_due, bill_payment_due_date)
            VALUES  (@bill_number, @customer_id, @bill_amount_due, @bill_payment_due_date)

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;            if screenWidth == 1024{
        rect1 = SKShapeNode(rectOfSize: CGSizeMake(screenWidth/50, screenWidth/23))
    }else if screenWidth == 568 || screenWidth == 480{
        rect1 = SKShapeNode(rectOfSize: CGSizeMake(screenWidth/50, screenWidth/23))
    }else{
        rect1 = SKShapeNode(rectOfSize: CGSizeMake(screenWidth/50, screenWidth/23))
    }

    rect1.fillColor = blackColor
    rect1.alpha = 0
    rect1.physicsBody?.dynamic = false
    rect1.physicsBody?.categoryBitMask = PhysicsCategory.rect1
    rect1.physicsBody?.contactTestBitMask = PhysicsCategory.ball
    rect1.physicsBody?.collisionBitMask = PhysicsCategory.None
    rect1.physicsBody?.usesPreciseCollisionDetection = true
    rect1.position = CGPoint(x: 924.325, y: 678.42)
    self.addChild(rect1)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no error, but the rectangle isn't showing up. Any help would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

Providing you have cleaned up the resources for your &lt;code&gt;Activity&lt;/code&gt; correctly, your activity will be cleaned up (eventually) by the garbage collector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding cleanup, it's import to know that &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Xamarin/advanced-memory-management-on-ios-and-android-mark-probst-and-rodrigo-kumpera" rel="nofollow"&gt;Xamarin discourages (slide 44 onwards)&lt;/a&gt; using finalizers. Here's why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They are not guaranteed to run within any deadline.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They don't run in a specific sequence.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They make objects live longer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The GC doesn't know about unmanaged resources.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, using a finalizer to perform cleanup is the wrong way of doing things... If you want to ensure that &lt;code&gt;MainActivity&lt;/code&gt; is destroyed, manually dispose the &lt;code&gt;Activity&lt;/code&gt; in it's &lt;code&gt;OnDestroy&lt;/code&gt; callback:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;protected override void OnDestroy ()
{
    base.OnDestroy ();
    this.Dispose (); // Sever java binding.
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will cause Mono to break the &lt;a href="http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/advanced_topics/garbage_collection/#Object_Cycles" rel="nofollow"&gt;peer object&lt;/a&gt; connection and destroy the activity during the next garbage collection cycle (&lt;code&gt;GC.Collect(GC.MaxGeneration)&lt;/code&gt;). From the docs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To shorten object lifetime, Java.Lang.Object.Dispose() should be invoked. This will manually "sever" the connection on the object between the two VMs by freeing the global reference, thus allowing the objects to be collected faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the call order there, &lt;code&gt;this.Dispose()&lt;/code&gt; &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be called &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; any code that invokes back into Android land. Why? All the connections between Java and .NET are now broken to allow Android to reclaim resources so any code that uses Android-land objects (Fragment, Activity, Adapter) will fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, onto some debugging techniques for Activity leaks. To verify that your activity is being cleaned up, add the following code to the &lt;code&gt;OnCreate&lt;/code&gt; method of your apps entry &lt;code&gt;Activity&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var vmPolicy = new StrictMode.VmPolicy.Builder ();
StrictMode.SetVmPolicy (vmPolicy.DetectActivityLeaks().PenaltyLog().Build ());
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This enables turns on &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/StrictMode.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;code&gt;StrictMode&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an extremely useful debugging tool that happily informs you when you've leaked resources. When one of your apps activities isn't released correctly, it will dump something like this to the output stream:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[StrictMode] class activitydispose.LeakyActivity; instances=2; limit=1
[StrictMode] android.os.StrictMode$InstanceCountViolation: class activitydispose.LeakyActivity; instances=2; limit=1
[StrictMode]    at android.os.StrictMode.setClassInstanceLimit(StrictMode.java:1)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining this with the &lt;code&gt;Dispose()&lt;/code&gt; call, you can check that activities are being released. Here is how you'd typically an &lt;code&gt;Activity&lt;/code&gt; and its resources in Xamarin.Android:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;protected override void Dispose (bool disposing)
{
    // TODO: Dispose logic here.
    base.Dispose (disposing);
    GC.Collect(GC.MaxGeneration); // Will force cleanup but not recommended.
}

protected override void OnDestroy ()
{
    if (density != null) { // Release Java objects (buttons, adapters etc) here
        density.Dispose ();
        density = null;
    }
    base.OnDestroy ();
    this.Dispose (); // Sever java binding.
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
